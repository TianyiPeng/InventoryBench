Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical samples for chips(Regular) show mean demand 106.4 (periods 1\u20135). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals \u2192 no evidence of lead-time change or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=151 (order placed Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time not confirmed; in-transit expected to arrive per promise. Use default lead time to avoid overfitting to incomplete arrival data. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all provided demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean 106.4 units; no concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1-2 (in-transit=304 matches ordered 151+153). Promised lead time remains plausible (no concluded arrivals beyond promise), so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set; this balances service level vs holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory (304) already covering several periods of expected demand.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=385 (sum of orders P1-P3). No concluded arrivals observed yet (orders from P1\u2013P3 have not concluded), so actual lead time is not confirmed \u2014 use promised lead time. Demand history (all samples) mean ~106.4 units/period; with promised L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods (~319 units), and current in-transit (385) should cover that. I choose default methods so the OR backend uses its standard calculations based on promised L and full-sample stats; this is conservative given missing concludes and keeps orders aligned with baseline demand while avoiding overreacting to possible lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (151, 153, 81 = 385 units) have not concluded by Period_4 despite promised lead time=2; potential shipment delays or losses observed (3 consecutive periods of missing arrivals).

Daily Profit: $440.00, Daily Holding Cost: $122.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $318.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. Recent concludes show mixed actual lead times: Period_4 conclude reports arrived=151 (ordered P1, lead_time=3) and arrived=81 (ordered P3, lead_time=1), so observed lead times = {3,1}. Promised L=2 but variability and a 3-period delay for P1 indicate uncertainty; using 'calculate' lets backend average observed lead times. Demand history mean=106.4 units; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) with L averaged ensures the OR base-stock uses the full review+lead demand while retaining historical volatility, balancing service (profit $4 vs holding $1) without over-committing given possible lost/delayed shipments. On-hand (122) + in-transit (153) were reconciled when setting L via observed concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $488.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=305. History shows inconsistent arrivals: P1 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=3), P3 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=1), several orders delayed or missing around promised L=2. I select L.method="calculate" so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures observed variability). Demand shows no sustained regime shift across provided samples, so use mu_hat.method="default" and sigma_hat.method="default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasting anchored to full history while the calculated L accounts for delayed arrivals, helping the OR engine size orders to cover the review+lead period without overcommitting inventory given holding cost.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=456. History shows mixed observed lead times (Period1\u2192arrived in P4: lead_time=3; Period3\u2192arrived in P4: lead_time=1) and recent orders (P5,P6) overdue relative to promised L=2. Demand history (periods 1\u20135 mean=106.4) used as base. To balance service vs holding cost given uncertain/variable lead time and overdue shipments, I let the backend compute an empirical lead time (calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently with the inferred L. This keeps parameters systematic while the system gathers more conclude evidence about persistent lead-time drift; no explicit increases that risk excess holding are used now.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=491, recent concludes show inconsistent lead times (observed: P1\u2192P4 lead_time=3; P3\u2192P4 lead_time=1) and multiple recent orders not yet arrived. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the mixed 1 and 3 observations). Demand history mean = 106.4; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) keeps forecasts anchored to full-sample demand while the backend uses promised lead time logic; this conservative choice avoids overreacting to noisy short-run arrivals while still allowing the OR engine to size orders against the inferred lead-time change and large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Delayed shipments: orders from Periods 5\u20137 (152, 151, 35) have not concluded by Period_7 (3 consecutive periods of missing arrivals), indicating ongoing shipment delays or potential losses.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: recent demand samples (132,74,101,90,135) mean=106.4. Current on-hand=56, in-transit=304; recent concluded messages show some shipments delayed but arrivals observed (observed lead_times = 3,1,3,1 \u2192 avg=2). I set L using 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages all demand history while the recalculated L accounts for observed delivery delays. This balances service level (accounting for longer observed lead times) against holding cost given moderate on-hand + large in-transit pipeline.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W={3,1,3,1}, avg=2). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 covering several future periods but earlier shipments showed 3-period delays intermittently; nonetheless average observed lead time = 2 (matches promised). Demand historical samples mean=106.4 (samples:132,74,101,90,135). I select L by "calculate" to let backend use observed lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use "default" to apply (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain but non-systematic delays.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=485. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W={3,1,3,1}, average=2). Demand history samples (132,74,101,90,135) yield mean\u2248106.4. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time (2). For demand I choose default mu_hat to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 3\xd7106.4, keeping forecasting stable given limited samples and no clear sustained demand shift. Sigma_hat=default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (using observed lead-time average) vs holding cost by not overreacting to intermittent delayed arrivals.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=485; recent concludes show mixed lead times (observed arrivals with lead_time values = [3,1,3,1]) indicating average actual lead time \u22482 but with delays/losses for some shipments. Demand history (seed samples) is limited; use conservative defaults so OR backend uses full sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). I set L='calculate' to let backend infer average observed lead time (captures observed 3- and 1-period arrivals), mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the base-stock policy is computed from all samples and scaled for the inferred lead time\u2014this balances service level given the large in-transit pipeline while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock from overreacting to delayed arrivals.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: on-hand=45, in-transit=304; historical demand samples mean = (132+74+101+90+135)/5 = 106.4. Multiple concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence: 3,1,3,1,3,2), indicating promised L=2 is unreliable. I set L using 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures variability and recent 3-period delays). mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given uncertain lead time and existing in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed variable and averaging ~2.17 periods (observed lead_times = 3,1,3,1,3,2; mean=13/6\u22482.17) \u2014 repeated multi-period delays observed across Periods 1\u201312.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent history shows variable lead times with observed lead_times = {3,1,3,1,3,2} (mean\u22482.17) and demand samples (132,74,101,90,135). On-hand=0, in-transit=440 which should cover multiple upcoming periods. Use calculated L to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded history; use default demand/volatility scaling so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all samples across the review+lead period. This balances higher effective lead time (protect service) against holding cost since inventory already in-transit.

Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=479. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [3,1,3,1,3,2] (mean \u22482.17) indicating actual lead time > promised and variable. To capture this, set L using 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). Demand history (provided samples mean=106.4) will be scaled by (1+L) via default mu_hat; use default sigma_hat to reflect overall demand volatility. This balances higher pipeline (in-transit) and service level needs against holding cost given elevated effective lead time.

LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=479. Historical concluded lead_times = [3,1,3,1,3,2] (mean\u22482.17) indicating lead time > promised and variable; use backend-calculated average lead time. Recent demand (Periods 11\u201315 = 91,136,79,107,122; mean\u2248107) is the most relevant regime (no strong seasonal signal). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to focus the forecast/volatility on the latest regime; this produces (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over recent data after backend computes L. This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302 for longer/variable L) against holding cost by using recent demand and inferred L rather than the promised value.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=95, in-transit=343. Historical concluded lead_times (observed) average \u22482.17 with repeated multi-period delays and some lost/delayed shipments; to reflect this confirmed longer/variable lead time I set L via 'calculate' so backend uses observed average. Demand history shows no sustained recent mean shift requiring a bespoke forecast, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level (accounting for longer actual lead time) against holding cost while letting the OR engine cap orders appropriately given its promised-lead-time model.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=48, in-transit=339. Historical concluded lead times show variability with multiple multi-period delays (observed lead_times: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3 \u2192 average ~2.17). Several past shipments were delayed 3+ periods so using inferred average lead time is prudent. I set L to calculate so backend uses the observed-average lead time. For demand, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine incorporate full-sample demand estimates while the calculated L accounts for prolonged/variable lead times; this balances service level against holding costs given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=421. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed lead_times = 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3) indicating actual lead time exceeds promised=2 on average. To capture persistent multi-period delays I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average observations). Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) are stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, which increases safety stock to offset longer realized lead times while letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: recent history shows variable actual lead times (observed arrivals with lead_times = 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3). Average observed lead time \u2248 2.38 periods; promised = 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=473. Using the calculated average lead time lets the OR backend account for persistent multi-period delays. I choose L by averaging all observed lead times to reflect the realized delivery pattern. For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; with in-transit=473 this coverage roughly matches (1+L)\xd7mean demand, so no emergency explicit uplift is needed. This balances service (capture delayed arrivals) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed variable, average observed lead_time \u2248 2.38 periods (observations: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3 across Periods 4\u201317); repeated multi-period delays persists.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 22: On-hand=0, in-transit=473, recent demand has been volatile with several stockouts (e.g., Periods 19\u201321 demands 41,133,192 unsatisfied). Multiple concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133 periods). I select L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history (captures variable/multi-period delays). mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' let the backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from demand samples, aligning safety stock to the inferred lead time while keeping methodology simple given limited stable regime evidence. This balances service level (by increasing coverage when calculated L>promised) against holding cost; existing large in-transit (473) will be counted in pipeline by the OR engine, preventing immediate over-ordering.

Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show mean ~106; no recent sustained demand regime change. To account for observed actual lead-time variability, set L to the observed-average (use backend 'calculate'). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level against holding cost given higher effective lead time and unchanged demand statistics.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=0, in-transit=473; recent conclude history shows variable lead times and multiple delayed arrivals (orders often arrive 1\u20133+ periods after ordering). Promised L=2 but observed lead times have averaged >2. To let the backend use observed lead-time data, set L method to calculate (backend will average observed lead times). Demand has been volatile with recent upward swings; use an EWMA to weight recent demand more heavily for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) so the base-stock reacts to recent increases while retaining some smoothing. Keep sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance higher service level given uncertain/longer lead times against holding cost, and leverage backend's capped ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25: on-hand=0, in-transit=473, profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical conclude messages show variable lead times and repeated multi-period delays; many shipments arrive > promised 2 periods. Use lead-time estimate computed from observed concluded lead times so backend averages empirical lead times. Demand forecast and variability use default methods ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let backend scale to the chosen L. This balances using observed lead-time evidence while leveraging full-sample demand stats; large in-transit stock reduces immediate need for extra ordering.

I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (captures variable actual LT), mu_hat=default to anchor forecast to all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean) given limited formal demand samples, and sigma_hat=default to provide standard volatility scaling. These choices balance using empirical lead-time info to size the review+lead demand forecast while keeping demand mean/variance estimation simple and robust given noisy arrivals and potential lost shipments.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=476, recent history shows variable/lengthened lead times and multiple delayed shipments. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the multi-period delays seen across concluded arrivals). For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 observed demands (captures recent volatility and the large spike at Period_25). Use sigma_hat='default' so backend computes volatility from full sample set adjusted for (1+L). These choices prioritize accounting for the confirmed variable lead time while adapting demand forecast to the most recent regime, helping the OR engine size orders to cover the review+lead period without excessive holding given high in-transit inventory.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=476, recent demand volatile with several spikes (e.g., P21=192, P25=155). Historical concluded lead-times show persistent multi-period delays; I set L explicitly higher than promised to reflect observed average lead_time \u22482.38. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (last 5 observed demands) so the OR engine targets appropriate base-stock and caps given current variability and overdue shipments.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=473. Historical concludes show variable lead times with multi-period delays; use backend-led average for L to reflect observed variability. Demand recent history is noisy; use EWMA (gamma=0.3) to weight recent demand more while retaining longer-run signal for mu_hat. Keep sigma_hat default so backend scales volatility by \u221a(1+L). These choices hedge against delayed arrivals (by letting L float) while tuning mean demand toward recent levels to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=473. History shows persistent variable/lengthened lead times (multiple concluded arrivals with leads 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,1,2 \u2192 mean\u22482.2) and many delayed/missing arrivals earlier; pipeline is large but uncertain. To let the OR engine account for observed actual lead times, set L by calculating the average observed lead time. Use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat consistent with the chosen L and full sample history. This balances service (using observed longer lead time) versus holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=473. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (multiple observations of 1\u20133 periods and prior summary avg \u22482.17\u20132.38). Several multi-period delayed arrivals and some lost/very-late shipments observed; pipeline is large today (473) so avoid inflating demand forecast. Choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history to estimate actual average. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) from full demand history; this leverages all available demand data while letting the backend incorporate the inferred lead time. These choices balance service level (accounting for longer, variable lead time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=473. History shows repeated delayed/mixed lead times and several lost/delayed shipments (many orders concluded 1\u20133 periods after order or not at all). I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses observed conclude messages to infer the true average lead time from history. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a stable demand forecast while the backend-adjusted L accounts for the irregular deliveries and lets the capped ordering handle pipeline constraints.

Use 'calculate' for L so backend averages observed lead times from concluded messages (captures variability ~2+). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost given the inferred L and available demand history.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=473. Historical concluded lead_times show persistent variability and multi-period delays; therefore set L by 'calculate' to let backend use all observed lead times. Recent demand has trended higher in the last 5 periods (Periods_29\u201333 = 41,176,101,135,147); use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime. This keeps (1+L) demand forecast responsive to the recent upward demand while sigma from recent data sets safety stock to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost given ongoing lead-time instability.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=539 units. Historical arrivals show variable actual lead times (1\u20133) with prior average ~2.2\u20132.4; multiple delayed shipments observed but many in-transit now. Given substantial pipeline (539) that will cover several periods of demand, set L to be computed from observed lead times so the OR engine learns current variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service level with holding cost while relying on the large existing pipeline to avoid urgent ordering.

Historical concluded lead_times show variability and repeated multi-period delays; many shipments overdue -> assume longer effective lead time. I set L explicit=3 (conservative above observed ~2.2\u20132.4 average) to protect against ongoing delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand across review+lead using all samples with the chosen L; this balances service (higher pipeline cover) vs holding cost given large in-transit exposure.

I set L to calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time. Demand parameters use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of provided demand samples; this keeps forecasts anchored to historical demand while the calculate L accounts for observed lead-time variability and helps the OR engine size orders to cover review+lead periods given the delayed arrivals.

Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variable/longer-than-promised arrivals). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand forecasts scale with (1+L) and observed sample stats; this balances service level given extended/variable lead times and avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise while the large pipeline is present.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=492. Historical concluded lead_times (observed across concludes) average \u22482.18 periods, indicating lead time > promised 2 and variable delays. Use L='calculate' to let backend adopt observed average lead time. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from provided demand samples; this balances service level against holding cost while respecting the longer inferred lead time and existing large in-transit inventory.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=492. Historical conclude messages show variable lead times with multiple delayed arrivals but no new sustained shift since Period_20. Large pipeline (492) likely covers upcoming demand; avoid inflating forecast. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average from concluded history. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L); this balances service level given uncertain lead time while avoiding excess ordering on top of the large in-transit volume.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=492, recent demand has been low-to-moderate but volatile (last 5 demands: 6,81,58,83,13). Historical concludes show variable lead times with repeated multi-period delays. I cannot assume promised LT=2 is reliable, so I let backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes. To capture recent demand regime and volatility, I use the last 5 demand observations for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets respond to current demand level while pipeline sizing accounts for observed LT variability and the large existing in-transit volume.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. On-hand=0, in-transit=473. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (multi-period delays and occasional 3-period arrivals); to hedge uncertainty use observed lead-time average. Use default demand estimators (backend will scale by (1+L)) so forecasts incorporate all sample history. This balances higher safety stock from longer inferred L against holding cost given profit=4 vs holding=1.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=473. Historical concluded lead times show repeated multi-period delays (observed lead_times: 3,1,3,1,3,2,1,2,2,3 \u2192 mean \u22482.1). Given persistent variability and evidence of shipments arriving after the promised 2 periods, set L to be computed from observed lead-time history so the OR engine uses the empirical average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand history; this balances service (higher L raises required pipeline) versus holding cost while relying on the backend's statistical calculation.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: on-hand=0, in-transit=473. Historical arrivals show variable lead times (multiple observed 3,1,2 patterns) and prior analysis indicates average actual lead time > promised. I select L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history to estimate effective L this period. Demand history (samples provided) is limited and I will let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat using defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies the base-stock formula with the inferred lead time while respecting its cap. This balances service level (by increasing coverage if calculated L>2) against holding cost given the large in-transit position and observed shipment variability.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=0, in-transit=473. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (multiple 3s,1s,2s) so use observed-average lead time rather than promised to reflect delays/loss patterns. Pipeline (473) likely covers multiple periods of demand but uncertainty remains; using 'calculate' for L lets backend infer average observed lead time from concluded history. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand scaling uses all available samples with the chosen L, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=473. Historical concluded lead times show variable multi-period delays (mean ~2.38 across observed samples). To account for observed lead-time variability I request the backend compute an empirical average lead time. Demand samples show no recent sustained regime shift, so use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)*mean, sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR engine balances service vs holding given the inferred L and large in-transit volume.

Set L explicitly to 2.38 to reflect sustained multi-period delays so the OR engine sizes pipeline for a longer effective lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand, balancing service level vs. holding cost given higher effective lead time.
