Decision timing & lead time: supplier promised LT=2.

Inventory/pipeline: on-hand = 0 so current-period demand must be met after arrivals (which occur after decision), but there is a very large in-transit quantity (411) that, if it arrives, would create heavy holding cost. Risk balance: given high in-transit volume relative to expected demand and the absence of any concluded arrivals (possible delay/loss), I avoid adding inventory that could exacerbate holding costs if the pipeline clears. Forecast & order logic: expected demand ~106 per period; promised LT implies ordering to cover 3 periods would be ~319 units, but with 411 currently in-transit (uncertain timing) ordering more risks large holding penalties.
