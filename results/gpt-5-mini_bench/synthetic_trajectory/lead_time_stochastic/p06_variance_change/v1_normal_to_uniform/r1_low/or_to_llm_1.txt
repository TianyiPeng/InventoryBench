{
  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=649. Concluded history shows actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: orders placed P1 arrived P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, etc.). Promised L=2 but reality L=3; use L+1=4 periods to cover upcoming demand. Demand estimate: historical base sample mean \u224898.2, later higher regime (~162) was observed around Periods 23\u201327 but not sustained long enough recently to overwrite previous patterns; OR recommended 0 using promised lead time and long historical data. With lead time=3 we need pipeline \u2265 expected 4-period demand. Even using a high-per-period demand (conservative) of 162 => 4\xd7162 = 648 demand; in-transit 649 marginally covers this. Given profit = holding cost, extra stock carries equal per-unit cost, so avoid over-ordering. Therefore do not order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and because pipeline is just enough to cover 4 periods under a high-demand scenario. Follow OR recommendation of 0.",
