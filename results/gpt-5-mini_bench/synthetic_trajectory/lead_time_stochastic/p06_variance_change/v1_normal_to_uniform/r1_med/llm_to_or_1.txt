Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical demand samples (122,121,60,83,105) mean\u224898.2. Promised lead time = 2 periods. Use default methods so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence and no confirmed lead-time shifts. No lost-shipment signals present.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: Recent concluded data shows Period_1 order=142 but arrived=0 (expected with promised L=2). On-hand=0, in-transit=142 (P1 order). Historical demand samples provided; no concluded arrivals or sustained lead-time changes observed, so use promised lead time and population demand statistics. Using default L lets backend assume promised lead time; default mu_hat/sigma_hat use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples to balance service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while the pipeline covers upcoming demand under current assumptions.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=285 (orders from P1=142, P2=143). No concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer lead-time change; shipments appear delayed but still in-transit. Use promised lead time to avoid premature corrections. Set L=default to keep promised L=2. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given current uncertainty and delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We are at Period_4. On-hand=0, in-transit=372 which equals sum of ordered units from Periods 1\u20133 (142+143+87); none of those orders have concluded as arrived by their expected arrival windows. This is strong evidence that actual lead time exceeds the promised 2 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P3 still in-transit). Demand observed in concluded periods: P1=118, P2=155, P3=128. To protect service while recognizing delayed arrivals, I set L explicitly to 3 (conservative increase above promised 2). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 (most recent 3 observed demands) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3 samples) (backend will compute). This approach responds to the clear shipment delays by lengthening lead time and using the most recent demand regime to size orders and safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed lead time >2 periods: orders placed P1(142), P2(143), P3(87) remained in-transit with arrived=0; in-transit total=372 matching those orders.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5: on-hand=112, in-transit=309. Historical demand samples = [122,121,60,83,105]. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4); average observed lead time = 2. Some shipments were delayed/lost earlier, so use observed-average lead time (calculate) to reflect actual pipeline timing. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, maintaining a balanced service level while accounting for longer effective lead time and existing in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $378.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6: on-hand=14, in-transit=383. History shows mixed actual lead times (observed W=3 for P1\u2192P4 and W=1 for P3\u2192P4) and one outstanding P2 order still not concluded. Given this, I let the backend infer the effective lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate) so it uses observed lead-time evidence rather than the promised 2. For demand forecasting I use the defaults so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) based on that inferred L; this balances service level (by incorporating observed longer lead time) against holding cost without overfitting to short-term noise.

Daily Profit: $56.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=473. Historical demand samples show mean ~98.2 with recent demands steady but shipments have been delayed (Period 4 conclude showed an order from P1 with lead_time=3 and P3 with lead_time=1). Several recent orders (P5,P6) have not yet arrived, suggesting lead time uncertainty. I choose L="calculate" so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures the confirmed 3-period event while averaging variability). For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so the backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which balances service level vs holding cost given the inferred longer/variable lead time. This keeps ordering conservative while not overfitting short noisy arrivals.

Daily Profit: $188.00, Daily Holding Cost: $119.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=119, in-transit=315. Historical demand samples mean = (122+121+60+83+105)/5 = 98.2. Observed concluded lead times: 3 (P1\u2192P4), 1 (P3\u2192P4), 3 (P4\u2192P7) \u2192 average \u22482.33, indicating actual lead time > promised 2 and variable. Several earlier orders were delayed but later concluded, so treat lead time as higher than promised by using calculated average. I set L=calculate so backend uses observed average lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend scales demand and volatility by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) using all samples; this balances service level (accounts for longer pipeline) versus holding cost given profit/holding ratio. On-hand + in-transit (119+315=434) covers multiple lead periods of expected demand (~98.2 per period), but variability and possible lost shipments warrant using observed average lead time rather than promised to avoid stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $214.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=118, in-transit=267. Multiple concluded arrivals show a consistent 3-period lead time (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) despite some 1-period arrivals. To avoid under-ordering given lost/delayed shipments, I set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand scaling so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect full review+lead demand and sigma_hat default to reflect observed variability over that horizon.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8)

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=29, in-transit=309 (pipeline=338). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed at Period_9). Demand last 5 concluded periods = [98,98,47,83,123], mean=89.8. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so the OR backend plans for (1+L)=4 periods of coverage. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (shorter, variable demands) so orders match current demand and avoid excess holding cost given Profit=$4/Holding=$1 trade-off.

LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=378. History shows multiple delayed shipments and confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (observed P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). To reflect confirmed longer lead time and let the OR engine compute demand across the review+lead window, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this leverages the full sample history while the explicit L corrects for delayed arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: recent demand samples show moderate volatility (history: 122,121,60,83,105, plus later periods) and current on-hand=0, in-transit=461 (large pipeline from prior orders). Concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time has been \u22483 periods recently; several orders have experienced multi-period transit. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the confirmed shift to ~3). For forecasting I use 'default' mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full sample set while the calculated L ensures the review+lead period is lengthened to cover delayed arrivals and balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12). Current inventory: on-hand=61, in-transit=316 (total pipeline=377). To account for the longer realized lead time and delayed arrivals, I set L explicitly to 3. I use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend produces a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time and available historical samples.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained across multiple observed arrivals). Recent demand (Periods 9-13 = 123,92,119,84,102) shows a stable average ~104 units/period; I use a recent-N forecast to capture current regime. Set L to explicit 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR backend forecasts over the correct horizon. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last five observed demands and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current demand variability. This balances service level (protects against stockouts given longer lead time) against holding costs by using recent demand estimates rather than long-run averages.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=362. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14); majority of observed lead times = 3. To account for persistent longer lead time and avoid stockouts while pipeline arrives, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given higher lead time and substantial in-transit stock.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=462. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders arrived with 3-period delays). Recent demand (Periods 11-15 = 119,84,102,130,123) averages 111.6. To protect service given confirmed longer lead time and recent demand level, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L) periods based on latest regime (captures current mean ~111.6). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand variability. These choices increase pipeline coverage for the confirmed 3-period lead time while keeping safety sizing tied to recent observed demand to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical concludes show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders observed arriving after 3 periods), so I set L=3 to reflect realized transit. Demand samples show typical mean ~98/unit (samples provided). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat allows the OR engine to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=3, producing a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the longer realized lead time and the substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=408. History shows sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16, P14->P17). Many orders arrive 3 periods after ordering, so set lead time explicitly to 3 to ensure pipeline coverage. Demand recent behavior centers ~100\u2013130 units; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime and to size base-stock for (1+L) review+lead period while capturing recent volatility. This increases protection against lost/delayed shipments by inflating pipeline coverage via L=3 and using recent demand stats.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed history shows actual lead time has been 3 periods repeatedly (multiple concluded orders with lead_time=3) and current in-transit=507 matches prolonged shipments. To ensure pipeline coverage use explicit L=3. Demand samples overall consistent with baseline; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances higher pipeline coverage for longer lead time while letting OR engine set safety stock per profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=507. Historical concludes show predominantly 3-period lead times (multiple P->P+3 arrivals) with some 1\u20132 period exceptions; recent long-run behaviour supports using observed lead-time statistics rather than the promised 2. Demand history (samples: 122,121,60,83,105) shows no sustained regime shift; use whole-sample demand estimates. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR engine internal base-stock uses the empirically longer lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (whole-sample) scaling by (1+L) to produce forecast across review+lead period. This balances service (capture multi-period in-transit) versus holding cost given high in-transit and zero on-hand.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed operational lead time so the OR engine sizes orders for the longer pipeline. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples) to keep forecasts anchored to historical demand while accounting for the longer lead time; this balances service level (higher pipeline for LT=3) against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Several orders past promised LT=2 took 3 periods, and some earlier shipments were delayed/lost, so use explicit L=3 to reflect observed reality. With L=3 I use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (matching observed longer LT) versus holding cost by letting the OR engine set base-stock from full-sample demand statistics while respecting the higher effective lead time.

Several past orders were delayed/lost before confirmation, so I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed reality. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing base-stock sized to cover the longer 3-period lead time while the backend caps order size to limit overstock risk given holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods. Therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed behavior. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the OR forecast toward the latest regime (captures the recent demand spike and volatility) while keeping holding costs in mind given high pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=507. Historical conclude messages show a sustained actual lead time=3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations); recent demand samples vary but no sustained regime change. To align OR engine (which assumes promised L=2) with observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering while limiting holding cost, I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this uses all historical demand (Periods 1\u20135 samples provided) to produce a conservative base-stock covering the longer effective lead+review horizon. This also leverages the large in-transit balance (507) to avoid immediate excess ordering while restoring service given delayed arrivals.

Recent demand (Periods 22-26) shifted higher and sustained (121,182,122,179,154), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the new regime. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let backend confirm the empiric average (will reflect the consistent 3-period lead). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the last 5 high-demand periods; this raises the base stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time and large in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent history shows sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 and subsequent pattern). On-hand=0, in-transit=613 (large pipeline). Demand history sample means used for baseline forecasting. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR backend accounts for the longer pipeline delay and avoids underordering. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full-sample stability given no recent demand regime change. This increases cover for the 4-period demand window (review+lead) to prioritize service given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29. On-hand=0, in-transit=613 (covers ~4 periods at current demand). Carry-over evidence confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). Recent demand has shifted higher and volatile (Periods 24-28: 122,179,154,174,26) so I use the last 5 periods to capture current regime. Set L=3 to match observed lead time so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale by (1+L)=4. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend targets inventory to cover the current higher-demand regime while reflecting recent volatility and avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=60, in-transit=524 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times are variable but skewed to 3; recent observed lead times used to capture current reality. Demand has been volatile; use most recent 5 demand observations to adapt forecast. Choices: L via recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent average lead time ~2\u20133; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to scale forecast to latest demand regime and avoid over/under-ordering given heavy pipeline; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility for safety stock. This balances service (use recent demand + lead time) against holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=524. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (confirmed previously at Period 9) but lead times have varied; use 'calculate' to let backend average all observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted upward in later periods (many demands >> earlier baseline); use recent_N with N=10 to forecast (uses most recent 10 demand samples to capture the high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR orders reflect current elevated demand while keeping volatility estimate aligned with recent variability. This balances higher service needs against holding cost given current zero on-hand and large in-transit.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. On-hand=0, in-transit=568; historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16, P14->P17, P27->P29) \u2014 treat actual lead time as 3. Recent demand has shifted higher (notable runs in Periods 27\u201331), so I anchor forecast on the most recent regime to capture current mean/volatility. Set L explicit=3 to ensure pipeline covers the longer confirmed lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect latest demand pattern and variability, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_33: on-hand=29, in-transit=534. Historical concludes show consistent 3-period actual lead time (arrivals from orders at P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, etc.), so I set L=3 to reflect reality. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (recent volatile demands including 187 at P30) so the OR engine sizes base-stock and cap to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while covering (1+L) periods of demand and guarding against short shipments/delays.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect realized LT and avoid under-ordering. Demand has been volatile with recent elevated periods; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime (covers the most recent 5 demands) so the backend sizes base-stock for (1+L) periods while the recent sigma captures current volatility \u2014 this balances service level (reduce stockouts given LT=3 and zero on-hand) against holding cost given existing large in-transit.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=524. Historical conclues show confirmed lead time=3 periods (established earlier). Recent demand (Periods 30-34 = 187,134,15,86,123) has mean 109 \u2014 I use a recent window to capture current regime. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) so backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands = 4*109 \u2248 436, matching pipeline coverage; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders sized to cover four-period demand while avoiding excess holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory (524).

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations), so I set L explicitly to 3. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand history so the base-stock adapts to the longer lead time while preserving its statistical calibration. This balances higher service levels (covering 4 periods of demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory; explicit L ensures OR orders account for observed delays and avoids under-ordering due to underestimated lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=524. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple lead times with many 3-period occurrences (samples: P1->P4=3, P4->P7=3, P5->P8=3, P9->P12=3, P11->P14=3, P13->P16=3, P14->P17=3, etc.) and several 1-2 period cases. Average observed lead time \u22482.13 periods, so use calculated average to let backend set L reflecting realized delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand while the calculated L accounts for longer realized lead times and the large in-transit balance, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. On-hand=0, in-transit=524. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed lead times of 3 periods (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) so actual lead time is longer than the promised 2. To let the OR engine incorporate observed lead-time behavior while using its demand statistics, I set L to be computed from observed lead times (calculate). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which balances service level (capturing longer pipeline) vs. holding cost without overfitting to short-term noise. This leverages the large in-transit position (524) and confirmed longer lead time when computing pipeline coverage.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=524. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent mix of 1\u20133 period lead times with average \u22482.06 (many 3s early, several 1s/2s later). Demand samples show no sustained regime shift (recent demand volatile but no 3+ period consistent change). I set L to 'calculate' so backend will use the average observed lead time (captures realized ~2.06). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging full history to balance service level vs holding cost given the confirmed variable lead times and sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=524. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (see prior evidence P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed reality so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period demand correctly. Recent demand has been elevated and variable (recent concludes show high demands such as 94,177,88,70,150 in the last 5 observed periods), so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest regime. These choices increase the base-stock to cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand and capture recent variability, while relying on observed pipeline (in-transit=524) to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed history shows multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 and Period 9 confirmation). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=540 \u2014 pipeline supply exists but arrivals have exhibited 3-period lag. To protect service given confirmed longer lead time, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples, letting it scale safety stock appropriately with the longer lead time and the profit/holding tradeoff.

To ensure orders cover the longer transit and the (1+L) review+lead horizon, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while the explicit L compensates for missing/delayed shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=540. Historical conclude messages and provided carry-over confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained observations). To protect service over the review+lead horizon while avoiding excess holding, I set L explicit=3. Recent demand has been variable; I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 6 periods: P41\u2013P46) so mu_hat reflects current regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of recent demand). Use the same recent_N for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices ensure pipeline covers (L+1) periods of expected demand given the confirmed longer lead time and balance fill-rate vs holding cost.

To ensure pipeline covers the true delay and avoid stockouts, set L explicit=3. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages all data while the explicit L corrects for observed longer lead time and prevents under-ordering despite large current in-transit.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical conclude messages (Periods 4,7,12,14,16,17,29,32,33,37 etc.) and provided carry-over confirm actual lead time = 3 periods; in-transit large balance matches multiple outstanding 3-period shipments. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. Demand has been volatile recently with several high values in the last five periods (Periods 44\u201348: 115, 8, 38, 103, 185) so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures current regime & variance). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and preserves service with the OR base-stock while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to cover variability; using confirmed L avoids systematic underordering given lost/delayed history.

I select L.method='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history (captures variable/shifted LT). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain LT and limited new demand regime evidence.
