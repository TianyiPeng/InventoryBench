Inventory position: on-hand=35, in-transit=143 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=178 units. Demand outlook: empirical mean from samples = (122+121+60+83+105)/5 = 98.2 units/period; recent 3-period average = (60+83+105)/3 = 82.7, suggesting a modest downward shift versus the full-sample mean but not yet a sustained regime change. OR recommendation (157) is based on promised L=2 and full-sample stats producing a 3-period expected demand \u2248294.6 and safety stock; pipeline (178) is below that target, so OR asks to order. Adjustment decision: because actual arrivals have been delayed/variable and recent demand is lower, I scale OR down to avoid excessive holding cost. Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1 leads to q=0.8 (OR's safety intent is appropriate), but with substantial in-transit inventory and only weak evidence of demand growth, ordering the full 157 risks high holding cost if demand softens. Final action: place an order of 117 units (OR 157 reduced by 40 units \u224825% cut) to partially close the gap toward the OR base-stock while limiting upside holding risk if delayed arrivals or lower demand persist. This keeps expected pipeline near covering ~1.8\u20132.2 future periods depending on arrival timing and lets us observe further arrival/lead-time patterns before committing more.
