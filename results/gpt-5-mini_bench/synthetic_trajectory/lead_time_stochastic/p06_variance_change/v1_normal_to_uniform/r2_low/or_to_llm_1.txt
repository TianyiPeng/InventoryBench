OR baseline (which uses promised L and full history) recommends ordering 14 units, which would bring pipeline roughly to expected coverage without creating excess holding cost now. Orders placed in Period 3 will only arrive in Period 5 (N+2), so they do not help immediate arrivals; given holding cost equals profit, avoid over-ordering. Because we have substantial in-transit inventory and no concluded evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift, I follow the OR recommendation of 14 units to top up the pipeline to cover the next ~3 periods while minimizing holding cost risk.

Profit and holding equal \u21d2 critical fractile q=0.5 \u21d2 z*=0, so base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 = 392.8.

Step 5 \u2014 Policy note: This increases OR's 68 to 142 because OR assumed L=2 and underestimates required pipeline for the observed 3-period lead time; ordering to the cap balances service with cap-based smoothing given supplier volatility and past lost shipments.",

  "rationale": "Observed actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded messages show P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). With L=3, an order placed now would arrive too late to affect demand within the remaining horizon. On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 416 units. Recent recent demand (Periods 44\u201348 = 1, 149, 159, 162, 59) averages \u2248106 per period; (L+1)=4 periods of demand \u2248424 units. In-transit 416 is essentially covering the next 4 periods (shortfall \u22488 units) but any new order cannot arrive in time due to confirmed 3-period lead time, so placing an order only increases ending inventory risk and holding cost without increasing sales this horizon. OR recommended 0; I follow that to avoid unnecessary holding cost and because new orders won't arrive soon enough to increase sales before the end. No new carry-over insight warranted.",
