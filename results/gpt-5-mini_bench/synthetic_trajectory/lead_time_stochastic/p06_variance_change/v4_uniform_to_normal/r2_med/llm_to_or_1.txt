Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet; historical demand samples (112,111,80,129,130) used. Promised lead time (2) retained because no observed lead-time evidence or lost shipments. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility to let OR backend compute base-stock while keeping safety stock scaled to promised lead time.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=146 (ordered P1), no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unconfirmed. Historical demand samples (periods provided) have mean ~112.4 and std ~18.1. Promised lead time is 2; I will keep L as default (promised) because we have no concluded lead-time evidence or lost shipment confirmation. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, capturing the historically observed demand and uncertainty while the pipeline (146 units) is monitored for arrival in future concludes.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3. Demand history (environment): samples = [112,111,80,129,130], mean=112.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=295 (orders from P1 and P2). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet for those orders (they should arrive during Period_3 and will be visible in Period_4), so do not treat as lost. I use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (captures full-sample demand estimate). This balances service level vs holding cost given no confirmed regime shift and substantial pipeline (295) already in transit.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4. On-hand=0, in-transit=339. History shows orders placed in P1 (146), P2 (149), P3 (44) but arrived=0 in their conclude messages \u2014 shipments have not concluded by the promised 2-period lead time, suggesting lost/delayed shipments. To be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to hold more pipeline cover. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; increasing L via explicit will raise demand-across-review+lead and uncertainty scaling, which increases target base-stock to protect service given missing arrivals while balancing holding cost (profit/holding = 4).

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments confirmed: orders from Period_1 (146), Period_2 (149), Period_3 (44) did not arrive by their promised lead time (no arrivals observed in concludes) \u2014 possible lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Profit: $284.00, Daily Holding Cost: $119.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_5. Inventory on-hand=119, in-transit=275. History shows heterogeneous observed lead times (order P1 arrived with lead_time=3; order P3 arrived with lead_time=1) and one outstanding order (P2) that has not concluded \u2014 indicating variability/delays but not a sustained lead-time regime shift. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent variability). For demand I use 'default' (1+L times mean of all samples) because recent sample size is small and no sustained demand regime change is evident. Sigma uses 'default' to reflect historical volatility scaled by review+lead. These choices balance service (accounting for variable/longer observed leads) against holding cost given current positive on-hand and sizeable in-transit, while avoiding overreacting to non-sustained signals or potentially lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $351.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: recent demand samples show modest, stable consumption (samples: 112,111,80,129,130). On-hand=25, in-transit=332; several early orders were delayed but some arrivals confirmed (Period1\u2192P4 lead_time=3, Period3\u2192P4 lead_time=1), indicating variable lead times. I choose to let backend compute average observed lead time (calculate) so L reflects realized variability. For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the OR engine combine the inferred L with full-sample demand statistics. This balances service (uses observed lead-time evidence) while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy arrivals; large in-transit already provides coverage so aggressive ramping is unnecessary.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent demand samples average 112.4 with moderate variability; current on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concludes show observed lead times of 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4) \u2014 average ~2. Several orders (notably P2) remain overdue, so use an empirically inferred lead time. I set L via calculate (avg observed lead times) to let backend adapt to realized delays. For demand, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to scale forecast and uncertainty for the chosen lead-time window; this balances service (captures multi-period demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock and recent stockouts.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 decision. Recent demand samples for chips(Regular) = [112,111,80,129,130] (mean=112.4, volatile). On-hand=0, in-transit=311; history shows some orders delayed (observed lead times: 3,1,3), indicating lead time variability and occasional lost/delayed shipments. To be conservative about service, set L method to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this leverages full sample set while the averaged L inflates coverage for the longer observed lead times and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=374. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W={3,1,3,3,1}); several shipments were delayed/lost earlier but some late arrivals have occurred. I set L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time (captures mixed 1\u20133 period arrivals). Demand history (samples provided) is stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W = 3,1,3,3,1,1 -> avg = 2.0). On-hand 70 + in-transit 311 = 381 units vs expected (1+L)=3 periods demand \u2192 default demand mean (3\xd7mean(samples)=~337) so pipeline currently adequate but some earlier shipments were delayed/lost and increased in-transit. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized behavior; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend computes a base-stock that balances profit ($4) vs holding ($1) using all historical demand evidence.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=352. Historical demand samples (Periods1-5): [112,111,80,129,130] with mean\u2248112.4. Several concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 1 and 3, with multiple 3-period observations (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) indicating a persistent longer lead-time regime. Given uncertain but confirmed longer lead times, let backend compute an average observed lead time from concluded data (method=calculate). Use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine increases cover for the longer implied replenishment while respecting its capped order. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit but delayed shipments) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_12. On-hand=0, in-transit=411. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W = 3,1,3,3,1,1) and multiple earlier missing/delayed shipments. To let the backend infer the true lead time distribution from observed concludes, I choose L='calculate' (average of observed lead times). Demand forecast and safety sizing will follow the backend's standard aggregation over the chosen L, so I use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' to apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the full sample set, letting the OR engine compute base-stock and cap while accounting for observed lead-time behavior.

No sustained demand regime shift detected versus historical samples. To account for confirmed longer lead time and ensure coverage for (1+L) review+lead demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 14. History shows actual lead time = 3 periods confirmed (Period 11 conclude evidence). On-hand=0, in-transit=375. Given confirmed LT=3 and mixed demand history, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine sizes orders over the correct pipeline. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise or isolated missing shipments.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:

To account for the longer realized lead time and avoid underordering given delayed/lost shipments, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full historical samples, balancing service level and holding cost given the longer coverage period and existing large pipeline.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=433, recent concludes show multiple orders arriving with 3-period delays (several P\u2192P+3 observations) indicating actual lead time longer than promised. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average (captures confirmed 3-period pattern). Demand history (5 samples: 112,111,80,129,130) is limited and shows no sustained recent regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR backend compute safety stock given inferred L. This balances service (avoiding stockouts given longer lead time) against holding cost.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=354. Historical conclude messages show observed lead times = [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3] (avg\u22482.3) with a recent cluster of 3-period arrivals. Demand recent 5-periods (P12-P16) = [65,85,136,52,88], mean\u224885.2. To account for the confirmed longer/mixed lead-time regime, I let the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate). For demand and volatility I focus on the most recent regime using recent_N N=5 so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand patterns and keep safety stock aligned with recent variability. This balances service level (capture recent higher/variable demands) vs. holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and longer effective lead times.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=318. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period lead times (many arrivals with W=3) though some 1-2 events occurred; overall observed lead-times average ~2.45. Demand samples provided are limited (5 samples) so use full-sample defaults scaled by inferred lead time. Reconcile: pipeline (318) is large relative to recent single-period demands, so avoid inflating safety stock. Set L by calculating average observed lead time to capture actual delays; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples) to keep forecasts grounded in available demand history and let backend cap orders to limit over-ordering given current pipeline.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=389. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages): [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,3] -> average \u22482.36. Multiple late arrivals and repeated 3-period observations indicate actual lead time > promised; use calculated average to let backend adapt. I choose L='calculate' so the OR engine uses observed average lead time. For demand I select default methods (mu_hat and sigma_hat = 'default') so backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs holding cost given uncertain lead time and the current large in-transit pipeline. This approach lets the optimizer account for longer effective lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats due to limited sample size and no sustained recent demand regime shift.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=394. Historical concludes show consistent 3-period actual lead time (multiple orders with lead_time=3); no evidence of a new demand regime from the five sample demand points. To ensure pipeline covers the confirmed longer transit, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend computes base stock and caps using full-sample statistics; this balances service (accounting for L=3) against holding cost given current profit/holding ratio.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders observed arriving after 3 periods) and several earlier missing/delayed shipments; on-hand=0, in-transit=422. Demand sample mean = 112.4 (5 samples). To reflect confirmed longer lead time I set L explicit=3 so the OR backend sizes orders for a 3-period lead; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (all-sample) formulas so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full history. This balances service level (accounting for confirmed LT=3) against holding cost while keeping demand estimate grounded in all available samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=422. Historical concludes show persistent actual lead_time=3 (multiple confirmed arrivals at 3 periods) and several lost/delayed shipments earlier; given strong evidence I set lead time explicitly to 3 to align pipeline coverage. Use default demand aggregators so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting OR engine apply its service-level cap. This balances higher required pipeline (L=3) against holding cost while relying on full-sample statistics for stability.

Use default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for volatility\u2014this balances service (covers extended pipeline) versus holding cost given high in-transit and uncertain arrivals.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_24. On-hand=0, in-transit=394. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period actual lead time signal in recent concludes (multiple orders with lead_time=3 including recent Period_23 arrival), so use a recent-average lead time. Recent demand (Periods 19-23 = 86,72,112,102,116) is representative of the current regime (mean \u224897.6, moderate variability). Set L to recent_N to capture recent actual lead-time behavior; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (last 5 demands) so the OR backend computes forecast across the review+lead period (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on recent demand, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1. No new sustained pattern beyond previously recorded lead-time confirmation.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_25 with on-hand=0, in-transit=422. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time \u22483 periods (multiple orders observed with 3-period lag). Recent demand has been high and stable (last 5 observed demands: Period_20-24 = 72,112,102,116,133) \u2014 I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Choices: L set explicit to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time; mu_hat set recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the most recent 5 samples; sigma_hat set recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These parameters aim to increase pipeline cover for the longer confirmed lead time and align safety stock with recent higher demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P20\u2192P23) \u2014 confirmed sustained lead time = 3. Several early-period shipments were missing/delayed, so using the confirmed actual lead time reduces chance of stockouts. I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to plan for (1+L)=4 periods of demand. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, scaling demand and variability appropriately for L=3 and balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_27. On-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period_1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8), so use L=3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid underordering. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all available demand samples (uses full-history average to smooth variability). This balances service level (using confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost given moderate demand variability and a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) = [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,3], average \u22482.36; demand samples recent history mean = 112,111,80,129,130 (overall mean=110.4). Several shipments were delayed/lost early; since Period_11 we've consistently observed many 3-period arrivals. To account for variable/longer realized lead times I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average observed values). For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples respectively; this leverages all available demand history while the calculate L bridges the gap between promised lead time and observed delayed shipments, improving pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods and reducing risk of stockouts given the elevated realized lead time risk.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period arrivals (majority of observed lead times), and recent demand (Periods 24-28) = [133,101,84,89,88] => mean ~99. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed/observed 3-period lead time (avoids under-ordering given delayed/lost shipments). For demand I use recent_N N=5 (1+L times mean of last 5 periods) to capture the current demand regime without diluting with older low samples. Volatility set to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability for safety stock sizing.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical concludes show repeated actual lead time \u22483 (multiple orders with lead_time=3). No clear sustained demand regime shift in recent periods. To capture confirmed longer lead time, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses empirical average (captures the confirmed 3-period reality). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, preserving full-sample demand signal given no strong recent changepoint.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show persistent 3-period deliveries (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3) and earlier missing shipments; use observed-average lead time to let backend adapt. Demand samples (Periods 1-5) will be scaled by (1+L) by backend; default variance uses all samples. This balances higher effective lead time (more pipeline) against holding cost.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses all samples scaled by (1+L), letting the OR engine compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff and the inferred lead time.

To reflect realized lead time and avoid under-ordering against delayed arrivals, set L explicit=3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, leveraging full history for stable demand estimate while the explicit L corrects for persistent lead-time increases.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical concludes show actual lead time has been 3 periods repeatedly (confirmed by Period 11 evidence); multiple earlier missing shipments noted. To reflect observed lead-time behavior I request the backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). Recent demand (last 5 periods: Period_29\u2013Period_33 = 95,97,69,97,111) appears representative of the current regime, so I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest demand pattern. This choice keeps the base-stock responsive to current demand while the calculated lead time accounts for the longer realized delivery delay and avoids underordering or excessive holding given the sizable in-transit pipeline.

Several early missing/delayed shipments were recorded but later concludes confirm arrivals with multi-period delays. I let the backend compute an empirical lead time average (calculate) so it uses all observed lead times; I use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to base mu_hat/sigma_hat on full historical demand (samples provided) and let the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given the computed L and demand stats.

To reflect observed lead-time behavior and let the OR engine compute base stock with actual average lead time, set L by calculate (use observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all demand samples\u2014this smooths regime noise and balances service level vs holding costs given the large in-transit position.

To ensure pipeline covers (1+L) review+lead demand and to let OR backend use full sample history for stable estimates, set L explicitly to 3 and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has often been 3 periods and many recent orders (Periods 24\u201340) never concluded, indicating longer-than-promised or lost shipments. To hedge service level while accounting for delayed arrivals I set L explicitly to 3 (matches confirmed observations). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples (conservative aggregation across available data) which increases target pipeline to cover the longer effective lead time and trades off holding cost vs stockouts given profit/holding parameters.

Carry-over insight: Resumed prolonged missing shipments since Period_24: orders placed in Periods 24\u201340 show arrived=0 in their concludes while in-transit=466 remains; suggests many shipments delayed/lost and effective lead time frequently \u22653.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical concludes repeatedly show actual lead_time = 3 (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, etc.) and prolonged missing/delayed shipments since Period_24. To reflect observed effective lead time I set L explicit=3 so pipeline coverage uses (1+L)=4 periods. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the model widen safety stock given longer lead time and balance service vs holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: recent demands ~80\u2013137 historically, last several periods demand ~91\u2013120. On-hand=0, in-transit=466 with many past shipments delayed/lost (prolonged missing shipments since Period 24). Observed concluded lead times repeatedly =3 in history; effective lead time appears to be 3 periods. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed deliveries so the OR engine sizes pipeline properly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a demand forecast that incorporates full historical variability while the explicit L accounts for prolonged delays and balances service level vs holding cost given high in-transit stock.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. On-hand=0, in-transit=466 \u2014 many shipments outstanding and historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals and long-delays/losses since Period 24. I set lead time explicit=3 to reflect confirmed/recurring 3-period effective lead times so the OR engine plans for longer pipeline. I use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to keep forecasts anchored to the full sample set given limited recent reliable arrivals. This balances higher safety stock (to cover L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Evidence indicates effective lead time frequently >=3 and several lost/delayed shipments. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed effective lead time so the backend sizes pipeline coverage for (1+L) periods. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine calculates demand mean/volatility from all samples (scaled by 1+L) \u2014 this balances service level given higher effective lead time while avoiding overfitting to noisy recent zeros.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=466, recent concludes show many arrivals with 3-period lead times and prolonged missing/delayed shipments since P24; promised L=2 is unreliable. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed effective lead time so the OR engine sizes pipeline for (1+L) periods. Use default demand/statistics so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples scaled by (1+L); this is conservative given no clear recent demand regime change and many lost/delayed shipments. This balances service (accounting for longer effective lead time and large in-transit) vs holding cost.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:

I therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect the effective delivery pattern. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples while using L=3, which raises the pipeline coverage and safety stock to mitigate stockouts given prolonged delays.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical concludes show frequent effective lead time >=3 and prolonged missing/delayed shipments since Period 24; many arrivals have been observed with 3-period delays. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the empirically confirmed longer lead time so the OR engine plans across a 3-period transit. Demand has shifted vs the very early samples; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 45\u201349) to capture the current demand level (~98\u2013120 range). These choices increase pipeline coverage ((1+L) review+lead demand) while keeping volatility estimates local to recent demand, which helps the backend balance service level (reduce stockouts given long lead times) against holding cost given existing large in-transit volume.
