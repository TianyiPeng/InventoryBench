Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Historical concluded arrivals show supplier lead time \u22483 periods for many orders (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12). Promised L=2 but actual deliveries are variable and often 3; however many overdue in-transit orders do eventually arrive. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0 but in-transit=562 units. Empirical recent single-period demand ~110\u2013120 units (historical samples and many period demands ~100\u2013130). 562 units in-transit therefore covers ~4.5\u20135.0 future periods of demand, exceeding (L+1) coverage even if actual lead time is 3\u20134. Cost tradeoff: Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 profit, $1 holding), so excess inventory directly reduces objective via holding cost. OR recommended 0 (base-stock with q=0.5 \u2192 no safety stock); that is sensible here given large pipeline. Final strategy: place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while awaiting large in-transit deliveries. Monitor concluded arrivals next periods; if in-transit depletes below coverage for (observed lead_time+1) periods, resume ordering.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ordering 0 units (follow OR): in-transit=562 covers ~4\u20135 periods of ~110\u2013120 demand, and holding cost equals profit so avoid excess inventory; wait for arrivals.",
