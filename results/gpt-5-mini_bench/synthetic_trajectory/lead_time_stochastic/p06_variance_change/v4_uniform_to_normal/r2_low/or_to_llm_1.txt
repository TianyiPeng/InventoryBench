{
  "rationale": "Confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods from prior concluded messages. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 450. Empirical single-period mean (from provided samples) \u2248112.4 \u2192 (L+1)=4 period demand \u2248449.6. With profit=holding, critical fractile=0.5 so no safety stock uplift; required pipeline \u2248450 units.
