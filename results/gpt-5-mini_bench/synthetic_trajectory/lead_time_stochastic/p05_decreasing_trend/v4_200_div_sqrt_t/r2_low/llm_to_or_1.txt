Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Use promised lead time and population demand statistics (all 5 samples) as no changepoint or delay evidence exists. Default L lets backend assume promised L=2. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat use (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples to balance service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1). This avoids overfitting to small-sample recent noise.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: recent observed demand samples (P1:204,P2:155,P3:134,P4:72,P5:108) seed forecasts. On-hand=0, in-transit=217 (order placed P1, arrived=0 in Period_1 conclude) \u2014 shipment is overdue relative to visibility but not yet confirmed lost. No concluded arrivals with lead-time info, so do not change promised lead time. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This is conservative given the outstanding in-transit units and balances service level vs holding cost until lead-time evidence appears.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=432. No concluded arrivals yet for our orders (Period 1&2 orders show arrived=0 in their conclude messages), so actual lead time is unconfirmed. I use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples. This is conservative given current lack of lead-time evidence and ensures pipeline + on-hand will be compared against (1+L) periods of demand by the optimizer.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: on-hand=0, in-transit=432, no concluded arrivals yet for prior orders (possible delays/lost shipments but not confirmed). Demand last 3 concluded periods = [191,113,149]; I keep L as promised (default=2) because there is insufficient concluded evidence to change lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples) and recent volatility, while the large in-transit position will be reconciled by the OR engine's pipeline consideration.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 view: on-hand=109, in-transit=236. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5): [204,155,134,72,108]. Concluded arrival in Period_4 shows an order placed in Period_1 arrived with lead_time=3 (promised=2) \u2014 evidence of at least one longer-than-promised shipment. I choose L via 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the observed 3-period lead time). For demand forecasting I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this keeps the forecast anchored to full historical data while the calculated L increases protection for the longer observed lead time and helps cover (L+1) periods of demand given current in-transit stock.

Daily Profit: $61.00, Daily Holding Cost: $48.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start. On-hand=48, in-transit=440. Historical demand samples: [204,155,134,72,108] (mean=134.6). One concluded arrival shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P4 \u21d2 observed lead time=3 periods (single observation). Given the observed delay vs promised L=2, I set L explicitly to 3 to protect against understock while we wait for more lead-time confirmations. Using default demand/volatility rules with L=3 yields mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each). This keeps orders conservative while current large in-transit (440) and on-hand (48) are resolving.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=470. History shows an observed arrival: order placed Period_1 arrived in Period_4 -> actual lead time = 3. Several subsequent orders (Period_2, Period_5, Period_6) remain in-transit beyond promised windows, supporting longer lead time. Recent demand has dropped starting Period_4 (Period_4-6 demands = 108,61,70). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new lower regime (use Period_4-6 average demand across the review+lead window). Sigma also set recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target stock to cover the longer delivery delay while basing demand forecast and safety on the recent, lower-demand regime to avoid excess holding cost given high holding=$1/unit and equal profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (order on Period_1 arrived Period_4); Demand regime shift at Period_4: avg demand prior (P1-P3)=151 units, recent (P4-P6)=79.67 units (-47%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 decision: confirmed actual lead time = 3 (arrivals: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). Recent demand has been lower since Period_4; last 3 demands (P5-P7)=61,70,89 (mean=73.33) indicating a sustained lower regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=449 (covers future demand but some shipments were delayed historically). To reflect the confirmed longer lead time and recent lower demand, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans over the correct horizon. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the post-changepoint regime (short-term mean \u224873.3, scaled by 1+L=4). This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given long lead time and current pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: recent demand has been variable but lower than early-periods after the confirmed drop at Period 4; last 5 observed demands (P4-P8) = [108,61,70,89,104], on-hand=100, in-transit=245. History conclusively shows actual lead time = 3 (orders from P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR engine accounts for longer pipeline delay. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the post-changepoint regime (P4\u2013P8) rather than the higher pre-shift mean; this keeps base_stock responsive to current lower-but-recovering demand. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect observed volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize avoiding overstock given holding cost equals profit while maintaining service given the longer lead time and substantial in-transit stock.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: demand has been lower since Period_4 (carry-over noted). On-hand=31, in-transit=246 \u2014 large pipeline but lead-time behavior has shown 3-period arrivals repeatedly. I set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times (backend will confirm average ~3). Demand forecast uses recent regime since the changepoint at Period_4: use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 4\u20139) so mu_hat reflects the lower recent mean across the review+lead window. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding overstock given reduced demand while respecting confirmed longer lead time and existing in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand has been lower since Period 4 (previously noted regime shift). To ensure the OR engine accounts for the confirmed longer lead time and existing pipeline, set lead time to 3 explicitly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping forecasts conservative given the demand regime shift and significant pipeline.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12. History shows actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (arrivals from P1->P4 and P4->P7 and P5->P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=452 (multiple long in-transit shipments consistent with L=3). Demand regime shifted down at Period_4 (carry-over). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set lead time explicitly to 3 and use recent demand (most recent regime) for forecasting: compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the last N=8 demand samples (Periods 4\u201311). This balances service (covers review+lead demand under the confirmed L) against holding cost by using recent lower mean and volatility rather than the higher early-period mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: observed sustained lower-demand regime since Period_4 (P4-P12 mean \u224878; last 6 periods P7-P12 mean \u224876.33). On-hand=13, in-transit=394 (large pipeline). Observed lead times from concluded messages = {3,3,3,3,2} \u2192 average \u22482.8, confirming longer-than-promised lead time signal. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time; for demand I use recent_N with N=6 (last 6 demand observations P7\u2013P12) to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given the large pipeline; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to match volatility to the recent regime. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the lower recent demand while accounting for the (longer) inferred lead time and high in-transit inventory so the OR engine limits new receipts and holding costs.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent demand has been lower than Periods1-3 (sustained drop since Period_4). On-hand=0, in-transit=394 units (multiple outstanding orders; several arrivals confirmed with lead_time=3). Evidence: Period_4 and subsequent conclude messages confirm actual lead time=3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time so the OR backend forecasts across the correct pipeline horizon. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the estimate on the latest regime (reduces weight of the pre-shift high-demand samples). This keeps base-stock tuned to lower recent demand while the larger in-transit position limits aggressive ordering; it balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=104, in-transit=245. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 (multiple arrivals: orders on P1,P4,P5,P11 arrived after 3 periods) and a sustained lower-demand regime beginning around Period_4. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (last 6 observed demands P9\u2013P14 = 69,66,85,45,55,45) to capture the current lower-demand regime; (1+L) scaling will let the OR backend compute mu_hat over the 4-period review+lead horizon. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=6 so variability is measured from the same recent window. No new sustained lead-time or demand shifts detected beyond the previously recorded ones; in-transit units are large relative to recent demand so the policy will cap orders appropriately.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: demand has been in a lower regime since Period_4 (carry-over). On-hand=58, in-transit=245 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are mostly 3 periods with one 2-period outlier; use backend-calculated average to capture this (method=calculate). Demand forecast uses recent data from the post-shift regime (last 12 periods) to reflect the sustained lower mean; volatility likewise uses the same recent 12 samples. These choices keep target base-stock tied to the current low-demand regime while letting the OR engine reconcile actual average lead time from observed arrivals; this avoids over-ordering given the large in-transit volume and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=8, in-transit=245. Historical concludes show actual lead time \u22483 periods repeatedly (orders from P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P11\u2192P14, P9\u2192P12), so I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time rather than promised. Recent demand has been lower since the drop at Period_4; I use recent_N for demand and volatility to capture the current lower regime. I choose N=7 (Periods 10\u201316) to balance recency and sample size; this will produce mu_hat and sigma_hat aligned to the recent mean/variation and help the OR backend set a base-stock that respects the larger observed lead time and current demand, avoiding excess holding given high in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=245. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time sustained at 3 periods (multiple orders observed arriving with W=3). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period_4 (sustained drop vs P1-P3); to capture the recent lower mean and current variability I use a recent-regime sample for forecasting. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering from assuming promised L=2. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 (periods 4\u201317) to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the sustained lower-demand regime; this balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time) against holding cost by forecasting on the current lower mean rather than the historical higher mean.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical concludes show most observed lead_times = 3 (several P->P+3 arrivals) with one 2; demand regime shifted down since Period_4 (recent demands ~45-62). I therefore let the system compute L from observed lead times (calculate) to capture mixed evidence but biased to observed 3-period reality. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 14-18) to reflect the lower recent mean ((45,46,50,62,38)) and reduce stock targets; sigma_hat also recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices align base_stock to recent lower demand while acknowledging longer actual lead time and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical conclude messages show multiple lead_time=3 observations (P4, P7, P8, P12 (one), P14) and one lead_time=2 (P12), so average lead time likely \u22483 \u2014 use calculated average to let backend reflect observed variability. Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period_4; last 5 demands (P15-P19 = 46,50,62,38,45) average ~48.2. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility, while L='calculate' lets the OR engine account for the observed slightly >2 lead time. This keeps target base-stock aligned to current lower demand and avoids overstock given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical conclues show persistent actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders with W=3) and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 4 (recent periods P4\u2013P20 average noticeably below P1\u2013P3). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering due to lost/delayed shipments. For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (periods P4\u2013P20) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime when forecasting (mu_hat) and its variability (sigma_hat). These choices keep base-stock targeted to the current lower-demand level while the longer lead time increases pipeline coverage to protect service; capping in the OR backend limits oversized orders to control holding costs.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: on-hand=0, in-transit=273 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times are predominantly 3 periods (several P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14) with an occasional 2; use calculate to let backend avg observed lead times. Recent realized demand (Periods 18-21 = 38,45,60,42; avg\u224846) is lower than earlier regime, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect current lower mean and volatility. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service from existing large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_23: recent demand has been lower since the confirmed regime shift at Period_4; current on-hand=0 with in-transit=273 (covers future demand but some earlier shipments showed LT=3 repeatedly, one LT=2). I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed concluded lead times (captures mostly 3-period reality). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (focus on the most recent 5 demand observations to reflect the lower recent regime and avoid being skewed by pre-shift high values). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the recent lower-demand regime while acknowledging the longer observed lead time, reducing stockouts from underestimated LT and avoiding excess holding cost from pre-shift high-demand averaging.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time ~3 (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P11->P14) so use calculated average lead time. Demand has been lower since the regime shift at Period_4; recent periods (P19-P23 demands = 45,60,42,56,45) better represent current demand, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the lower mean and volatility. The large in-transit quantity provides coverage vs. forecast; using recent demand reduces over-ordering risk while calculate L lets backend account for observed ~3-period lead time.

On-hand=0, in-transit=273 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely reflects earlier orders. Lead-time observations (concludes) previously confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods; I'll use that explicitly to align ordering with true arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-changepoint demand regime (use the most recent 20 demand samples) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current low-demand regime, avoiding overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_26. Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period_4 (typical demands ~30\u201370 vs earlier ~150s). On-hand=0, in-transit=273 (large pipeline from prior orders). Observed concluded lead times are dominated by 3 periods (previous carry-over confirmed), with occasional 2; I let backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate) to capture any small drift. For demand I target the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 (captures Period_6\u2013Period_25 recent behavior within the sustained low regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to the current lower mean and its volatility while accounting for (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances avoiding overstocks given large in-transit inventory and holding cost, while preserving service given remaining pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 27. On-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical conclude messages (Period 4,7,8,12,14) confirmed actual lead time=3 earlier; no new confirmed lead-time changes. Demand has been in lower regime since Period 4 (carry-over noted). To protect service given long in-transit and confirmed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent regime to reflect the lower sustained demand; choose N=20 (capped) to smooth short noise but capture the prolonged downshift. Apply recent_N for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent variability. These params bias ordering toward lower base-stock consistent with reduced demand while respecting longer confirmed lead time and existing pipeline to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. Recent confirmed lead time = 3 periods (carry-over). Recent demand regime is the lower regime starting Period_4 (many periods of demand ~20\u201370). On-hand=0, in-transit=273 \u2192 pipeline covers ~273/(1+L)=273/4\u224868 units/period, roughly matching recent demand. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time so the OR engine plans against reality. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts/volatility on the sustained low-demand regime (large sample since changepoint at Period_4), giving the backend a demand estimate that avoids overstocking relative to current demand levels and balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 3 with one 2 (observed lead_times = [3,3,3,3,2,3], avg\u22482.83). Recent demand has been lower since the documented regime shift at Period_4. Because lead time appears persistently > promised, I set L to the calculated average to reflect longer arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, keeping central forecasting stable while letting the longer inferred lead time increase pipeline coverage and buffer service level versus holding cost tradeoff.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period_4 (sustained drop vs P1-P3). On-hand=0, in-transit=307 suggests sizable pipeline arriving in future periods; historical concludes consistently show lead_time\u22483. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed operational reality. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the sustained lower-demand regime (captures recent mean and variability over the last 10 periods) so the OR engine sizes base stock for current low-demand regime while the explicit L prevents underestimating pipeline exposure from delayed arrivals.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: recent demand has remained in the lower regime since Period_4 (sustained lower weekly sales). On-hand=0, in-transit=307 \u2014 substantial pipeline covers multiple periods but arrivals are delayed (historical actual lead time=3). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to forecast across review+lead based on the sustained low-demand regime (reduces over-ordering vs. using all-sample mean). Sigma uses recent_N (N=20) to capture recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service given confirmed longer lead time and current pipeline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: recent realized demand has been low (many periods with demand 20\u201360) and carry-over already confirmed lead time=3 from earlier concluded arrivals. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=307 (pipeline available in future periods). I select L="calculate" to let the backend use observed lead-time history (captures confirmed 3-period behavior). For demand I select mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative aggregate forecast given the long low-demand run and avoiding overfitting to transient fluctuations. These settings balance service level (using observed lead time) with holding cost sensitivity by relying on aggregate demand statistics.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical concludes confirm actual lead times include multiple 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14) with one 2\u2010period observation; demand has been lower and steady recent periods but prior carry-over already recorded. Reconcile: large pipeline (307) likely covers several future periods; no evidence of new sustained regime change (needs \u22653 periods of consistent new signal beyond previously recorded). Choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period mode); mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' to use all historical demand for (1+L)-period forecast and volatility since no new significant sustained shift is confirmed. This setup trusts observed lead-time behavior while keeping the base-stock sized by overall demand history to balance service (profit=holding cost) versus inventory holding.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical concluded arrivals show majority lead_time=3 with one lead_time=2 (avg \u22482.83), so I use calculated lead time to reflect realized behavior. In-transit volume is large relative to recent demand, so use default demand/volatility estimation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap using full-sample statistics. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead time) versus holding cost given high pipeline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 35. On-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical conclude messages show multiple observed lead times (mostly 3, one 2); recent demand (Periods 30-34 = 46,36,51,28,55) averages ~43.2, clearly lower than early-period spikes. I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed LT\u22482.83). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to target the current low-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands). For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices reduce stock buildup given long effective lead time while maintaining service for current lower demand.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (confirmed in carry-over). Demand experienced a sustained downward regime starting at Period_4; recent demands (Periods 4\u201335) are lower and stable. On-hand=0, in-transit=307 (covers multiple future arrivals). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR backend will size orders for the correct pipeline horizon. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Period_4 low-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise; N=20 chosen because the regime length since Period_4 is >20 (rule: N = min(regime_length,20) capped, >=3). This prioritizes service (using recent lower mean) while avoiding overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: P37. On-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical concludes show repeated lead_time=3 for many orders (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P11\u2192P14, etc.), so use calculated average lead time. Recent 20-period demand (P17\u2013P36) average ~42.6 \u2014 demand has been in a lower regime since P4; use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current demand and volatility. With in-transit=307, pipeline plus order targets should cover (1+L) periods; these parameter choices reduce overstating demand (lower holding cost) while keeping service against observed lead-time risk.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: recent observed actual lead times cluster at 3 periods (confirmed earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=307. Recent demand (Periods 31-37 = 36,51,28,55,69,19,13) shows lower, variable demand vs earlier high regime. To capture current regime I set L by calculating observed lead times and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent 7 periods. This balances service level (accounting for confirmed longer lead time) with lower recent demand to avoid excess holding costs.

LLM Rationale:

Demand regime shifted down at Period_4 and has persisted; use recent regime data to forecast. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time and avoid under-ordering. Use mu_hat recent_N N=20 and sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the most recent sustained low-demand regime (caps N per rules). This balances service level (accounting for longer lead time) against holding cost by sizing base stock from recent demand patterns rather than older high-demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: recent demand is lower than early periods (previously recorded regime shift at Period_4). On-hand=0, in-transit=307 \u2014 with lead time confirmed=3, these in-transit units will arrive ~3 periods after their order. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals showing 3). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period demand estimate and volatility on the post-shift regime (useful because demand dropped ~47% at Period_4 and the lower regime is sustained). This balances service level vs holding cost by sizing base stock around recent lower demand while accounting for observed variability and the longer confirmed lead time.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 (observed repeatedly). No new sustained demand regime or lead-time change since the last carry-over insight. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality so the OR backend correctly sizes pipeline coverage. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all historical samples (stable approach given no new significant changepoint). This balances service (using confirmed L) against holding cost without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period_4 (sustained lower mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=307 \u2014 several earlier orders are still in-transit but arrive with multi-period lag (historical concludes show frequent 3-period lead times). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed lead-time evidence and avoid under-ordering. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-changepoint low-demand regime (use last 20 samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). Sigma uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago high-variance samples. These choices prioritize service (using observed longer lead time) while keeping mu_hat and sigma_hat tied to the lower recent demand to limit excess holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical conclude messages show mostly 3-period actual lead times (one 2); pipeline is large relative to recent low demand. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures the prevailing ~3). For demand/uncertainty I select default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this balances service level (use observed pipeline + base stock) vs holding cost given profit=holding. Defaults are conservative given uncertain recent low demand and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: observed persistent lower-demand regime since Period_4 and multiple concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time > promised (many observed LT=3, occasional 2). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=307 (useful pipeline). I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures confirmed LT\u22483). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current low-demand regime (last 10 periods) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean, avoiding overweighting early high-demand samples. Sigma uses recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock from older high-demand periods while respecting the longer realized lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time \u22483 (multiple Pn\u2192Pn+3 confirms) and a sustained demand drop from Period_4 onward. No new sustained pattern since prior carry-over. To reflect confirmed longer lead time I let backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). For demand I focus on the recent low-demand regime (use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent stable 20 periods since the regime shift). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=20 to reflect current demand variability. These choices keep pipeline coverage aligned to observed lead time while sizing base-stock to the recent lower-demand regime, balancing service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. On-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical conclude messages (Periods 4,7,12,14, etc.) confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods previously; pipeline is large (307) so avoid increasing demand forecast. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast and volatility I use default methods so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) using the confirmed L; this balances service (uses full-sample estimate) while avoiding extra ordering given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical conclude messages show most observed lead times = 3 (multiple orders ordered on P1,P4,P9,P11 arrived with lead_time=3) so set L=3 to reflect confirmed slower deliveries. Demand has been lower and stable since the regime shift around Period_4; to capture recent demand pattern I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures last 20 demand observations to reflect current lower mean/volatility). These parameters bias orders to match the sustained lower demand while accounting for confirmed longer lead time and protecting service level vs holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times mostly 3 (several P?_to_P? arrivals) with one 2 \u2014 average lead time > promised 2. Recent demand is lower than early periods but volatile; use recent demand window to focus forecast on the current regime. Choose calculated lead time to capture observed shift; use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast/volatility reflect recent demand behavior and reduce carryover from early high-demand bursts. This keeps orders moderate given large in-transit stock and balances service vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision: on-hand 0, in-transit 307. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time ~3 (multiple orders with lead_time=3). Pipeline (307) is large relative to recent demand, so avoid inflating forecasts. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period reality). For demand I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 conservative given long history and current large pipeline. This balances service (respecting confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost by relying on historical averages rather than upweighting recent low/no-order periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: recent history shows sustained lower demand since Period_4 (carry-over noted) and confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (observed arrivals). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=307 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers several future periods. To reflect confirmed lead-time evidence I set L explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7overall mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7overall std from historical samples; this avoids overfitting to short-term noise while the large in-transit position reduces urgency to inflate forecasts. Defaults balance service level vs holding cost given high pipeline.
