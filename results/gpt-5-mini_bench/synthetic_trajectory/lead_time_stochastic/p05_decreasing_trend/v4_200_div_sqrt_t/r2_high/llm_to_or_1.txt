  Mean: 134.6, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory. No concluded arrivals exist yet to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time and population demand stats. Profit/Holding imply high service target; rely on backend's base-stock calc. Chosen: L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so OR engine computes safety stock from full-sample mean/variance without overfitting early noise.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=217; Period_1 conclude shows ordered=217 arrived=0 (no concluded arrivals yet), so actual lead time not confirmed. Use promised lead time (default) for L. Demand history mean=134.6 (periods 1\u20135). Because profit ($19) >> holding ($1) favor higher service level, but no sustained demand/lead-time change evidence exists, use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes base-stock with full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L). This also keeps pipeline coverage for the review+lead period while avoiding overcommitment given possible delayed shipment.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, In-transit=444. Promised lead time=2. Conclude messages show P1 and P2 orders have not yet concluded (with promised L=2 these arrivals will be visible in future concludes), so no evidence to change lead time. Use default lead time and default demand estimates based on all historical samples (Period_1\u20135). This balances service (use full-sample mean) vs holding cost given in-transit coverage.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4. On-hand=0, in-transit=554 (sum of prior orders) but concl. messages through Period_3 show arrived=0 for earlier orders; the Period_1 order failed to conclude by its promised arrival (suggesting a lost shipment), while Period_2 and Period_3 orders are still in-transit (may still arrive). Evidence is not yet sufficient to confirm a persistent lead-time increase (only one order missed its promised arrival). To avoid overreacting to a potential isolated loss, keep L at the promised value and let the OR engine use full-sample demand stats. Therefore use default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost while we gather more conclude data to confirm any lead-time shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1833.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: recent demand samples (204,155,134,72,108) show moderate variability; current on-hand=219, in-transit=227. History shows mixed actual lead times: P1\u2192P4 (LT=3) and P3\u2192P4 (LT=1). Pipeline includes arrivals that were delayed relative to promised LT=2. To reflect observed lead-time variability I request the backend compute L as the average of observed lead times (method=calculate). For demand sizing I use default methods so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples respectively; this balances service level vs holding cost using all historical demand given limited evidence of a sustained regime shift. This also lets the OR engine apply its cap on order quantity to protect against over-ordering given on-hand + in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1001.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=158, in-transit=434, recent demand samples = [204,155,134,72,108] (mean=134.6). Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (order P1\u2192P4: LT=3; P3\u2192P4: LT=1). I set L using calculate to let backend use observed average lead time (2). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a neutral forecast (captures overall demand and variability) while the computed L accounts for observed lead-time variability and avoids overreacting to limited late/early arrivals. Current on-hand + in-transit covers multiple periods of demand; parameters balance service level vs holding cost by using empirical demand stats and observed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1242.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=88, in-transit=514 (matches outstanding orders 227+207+80). Historical concluded arrivals show lead_times of 3 (P1->P4) and 1 (P3->P4), average=2, so use calculated L to reflect observed data. No evidence of lost shipments; pipeline appears intact. I choose L=calculate so backend uses average observed lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), balancing service level (profit/hc) with current pipeline coverage.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8. Recent concluded history shows variable lead times (arrivals: P1\u2192P4 lead_time=3, P3\u2192P4 lead_time=1) and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=566. Use calculate for L so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures recent variability vs promised=2). Use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, leveraging full sample set (Periods 1\u20135 demands) while accounting for the inferred lead time. This balances service level (by using observed lead-time average) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=155, in-transit=380. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = {3,1,3,1} (orders from P1->P4, P3->P4, P5->P8, P7->P8). Average observed lead time = 2 (matches promised 2) but arrivals are variable (1 or 3). Pipeline (535 total) currently well above recent demand rates, so no urgent replenishment risk. Choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (captures bimodal variability but average=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given ample pipeline and no sustained demand regime shift.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 context: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5): [204,155,134,72,108] (mean=134.6). Current inventory: on-hand=159, in-transit=400. History shows mixed actual lead times (arrivals from orders placed in P1,P3,P5,P7,P8 giving observed lead_times = [3,1,3,1,1]). Given this variability, I let the backend compute an empirical lead time (calculate) from observed lead times, and use default demand estimates so mu_hat and sigma_hat are (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively. This balances service level (captures observed lead-time risk) against holding cost while leveraging full sample history. No explicit mu/sigma overrides because recent demand shows no clear sustained upward regime that justifies scaling forecasts.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead time variability: observed lead_times = [3,1,3,1,1], average = 1.8 periods (evidence from concluded arrivals P4,P4,P8,P8,P9).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=93, in-transit=425. Historical demand samples mean = (204+155+134+72+108)/5 = 134.6 units/period. Recent concluded arrivals show lead-time variability (observed lead_times = [3,1,3,1,1], avg 1.8) but not a sustained shift away from ~2; large in-transit pipeline suggests we should not aggressively up-weight demand. I select L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times, mu_hat='default' so (1+L)*mean_all_samples keeps orders aligned with long-run demand, and sigma_hat='default' to reflect full-sample volatility. This balances service level (using observed lead-time calc) against holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=8, in-transit=465. Recent concluded history shows variable lead times (evidence in prior periods) and no new sustained demand regime shift. Pipeline (465) already large relative to demand, so avoid increasing forecast; use inferred lead-time from observations and let backend compute demand-targets using defaults. This balances service (large pipeline) against holding cost by preventing additional ordering.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=26, in-transit=446. Recent concluded arrivals show lead_times = [3,1,3,1,1], avg \u22481.8 \u2192 persistent variability around promised 2. Pipeline is large relative to typical demand so risk of stockout is low, but lead-time uncertainty justifies using a recent average. I set L to recent_N (last 5 observed lead times) so the OR engine uses an empirically-informed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat left as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current high pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=21, in-transit=454. Historical concluded lead times show variability with recent observed lead_times = [3,1,3,1,1] (avg 1.8). To capture measured lead-time variability I select L by averaging observed lead times. Given ample in-transit stock, use default demand sizing and volatility so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this balances service vs holding cost without overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: demand samples show moderate recent variability (samples mean ~126, see history). Current on-hand=41 and large in-transit=421 cover multiple periods; no clear new sustained demand/lead-time regime beyond previously recorded variability. I select L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed concluded lead times (captures the 1.8-period average from history). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given high pipeline inventory and known lead-time variability.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=24, in-transit=427. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times with more 3-period observations in the most recent arrivals, suggesting actual lead time > promised 2. Pipeline (451 total) already large vs. recent demand (~45-70); still, use a recent-window view to reflect the latest demand level and lead-time regime. Set L via recent_N to focus on the most recent 5 observed lead-times (captures recent string of 3-period arrivals). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=5 to base the base-stock on the latest demand regime (Periods 12-16 demand = [45,55,45,46,50]) so the OR engine reduces excess safety stock relative to older high-demand samples while respecting longer recent lead times. This balances service (longer L) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1129.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent concluded arrivals show many 3-period lead times (multiple orders from P11\u2013P16 arriving after 3 periods) so actual lead time appears longer than promised. On-hand=49, in-transit=340 => pipeline=389; using L=3 (explicit) increases the (1+L) review+lead horizon to 4 periods so mu_hat default=(1+L)*mean(all samples) captures demand over that horizon. I select sigma_hat default to scale volatility for the longer horizon. These choices force the OR backend to target a higher base-stock (higher safety stock) to cover frequently observed 3-period delays while balancing holding cost via the backend's q-based z* calculation.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times through Period_17: [3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,3,3,1], average=2.25; majority are 3 periods (8 of 12 observed). Evidence of sustained longer-than-promised lead times.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded lead times through Period 18 show a clear shift above the promised 2: majority are 3 periods (8 of 12 observed). Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand samples show no clear, sustained new demand regime beyond historical samples, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) to let the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded lead times show majority=3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3 across recent history) indicating promised L=2 is too short; several shipments arrive 3 periods after order or are delayed. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed sustained longer lead time. Demand samples (204,155,134,72,108) will be scaled by (1+L) in backend; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, letting it produce a base-stock target that raises order coverage for the longer lead time while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 21. On-hand=0, in-transit=516. Concluded arrivals through Period 17 show frequent 3-period lead times (majority 3); recent periods (18-20) have no new concludes so use all observed lead-time data. Demand has been lower recently (~50 units/period over last 5 periods), so forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent 5-period statistics to reflect the current regime. These parameters keep base-stock responsive to the observed longer lead times while avoiding overstock given low recent demand and low holding cost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 22: recent demand has been muted (Periods 17-21 demands = 62,38,45,60,42; recent mean \u224849.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=516 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show sustained longer-than-promised lead times with majority = 3 periods; to be conservative I set L=3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility reflecting the recent lower-demand regime and avoids inflating orders from older higher samples. This keeps service high while limiting holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

On-hand=0, in-transit=516 (large pipeline but arrivals delayed historically). Set lead time explicit=3 to reflect observed reality; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on most recent regime (last 5 demands) so OR backend bases base_stock on current demand level and elevated lead time, balancing high profit vs low holding cost.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 decision. Recent concluded history shows sustained longer-than-promised lead times (majority 3 periods through P17). On-hand=0, in-transit=484 (covers upcoming demand under longer L). Demand has pulled back recently (last 5 concluded demands P19\u2013P23 = 45,60,42,56,45; mean \u2248 50). I set lead time explicit=3 to reflect observed sustained 3-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new, lower-demand regime and avoid overweighting early high samples. Volatility is set recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices bias orders down versus historical all-sample averages while accounting for longer deliveries and current pipeline to balance service level vs holding cost.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delivery behavior; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to focus forecast on the most recent regime (1+L=4 review+lead multiplier applied by backend); sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service against longer lead times while keeping variability and holding cost grounded in recent demand.

Recent demand has been lower than early-game; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime (periods 21-25 demands: 42,56,45,34,20). Using recent demand avoids inflating forecasts from early high-demand samples and keeps holding costs low while the long lead time preserves service by ordering for 1+L periods.

Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded lead times show a sustained shift to 3-period deliveries (majority observed = 3), so treat actual L as 3 to avoid under-ordering. Use L explicit=3. For demand forecast use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples; this balances service level given higher lead time while avoiding aggressive explicit increases given recent low on-hand and mixed demand samples. No shipment conclusively lost this period but large pipeline exists, so keep forecasts conservative.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent history shows frequent 3-period arrivals (majority of observed lead times through P17 were 3), and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=484 units (large pipeline outstanding). Several past orders arrived with lead_time=3 suggesting actual lead time > promised. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-time history (captures observed longer lead times). Demand samples (periods 1\u20135 sample set provided) and recent variability are moderate; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, producing a base-stock that balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while accounting for longer effective lead time and the large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded lead times show a sustained shift toward 3-period deliveries (majority 3, avg >2 since Period 18). Demand samples available earlier have moderate mean; to protect service given longer observed LT and large in-transit pipeline, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, letting the OR engine size base-stock and cap appropriately while accounting for the longer L.

Demand samples (given) have mean ~134.6. To let the OR engine account for observed longer-than-promised lead times, set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving the full-sample demand estimate while the calculated L inflates the review+lead demand coverage to reduce stockouts given many in-transit units and delayed arrivals.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded arrivals show majority lead times = 3 (carry-over evidence through Period 17: 8/12 observed = 3, avg\u22482.25). Several orders have arrived with 3-period delays and some variability; recent history shows prolonged in-transit volume. To be conservative against delayed/lost shipments, I set L explicitly to 3 periods (longer than promised 2). For demand forecast and volatility I use default rules so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine scale safety stock for the longer lead time while capping order size. This balances higher service level (avoid stockouts given observed 3-period arrivals) versus holding cost by relying on the backend's capped order logic.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded lead times show a sustained shift to 3 periods (majority=3, recent average >2). To protect service given long/variable actual lead times and high profit ($19 vs $1 holding), I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (captures longer review+lead coverage while letting backend apply service-level z based on profit/holding). This biases orders upward to cover the longer observed transit and reduces stockouts given possible lost/delayed shipments.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times frequently > promised 2 (carry-over evidence through Period 18: average ~2.25, many =3). No new sustained lead-time or demand regime confirmed since Period 18. To let the backend reconcile observed lead-time variability with its promised-L model, I request the backend compute an empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). For demand I use defaults so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2014 conservative given sparse recent arrivals but sizable pipeline; this avoids overreacting to recent zero-observations while allowing the backend to size orders accounting for the inferred L.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Recent history shows sustained longer-than-promised lead times (majority 3 periods) and current on-hand=0, in-transit=484. To ensure pipeline covers the appropriate review+lead window and because concluded arrivals historically point to L=3, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap consistently; this leverages historical demand while letting the backend balance service level vs. holding cost given the explicit longer lead time.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. History shows sustained longer-than-promised lead times (majority 3-period observed, avg ~2.25) and many recent demand periods at a lower level than early history. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed majority-3 lead times and avoid stockouts given large outstanding pipeline with delayed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N N=5 (Periods 31-35 demands = 36,51,28,55,69; mean=47.8) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to focus the forecast on the current lower regime. I apply sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (avoid lost sales under longer lead time) while limiting excess holding by using recent demand rather than the full-history mean.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. On-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded lead times show sustained drift above promised (majority = 3), so use observed-average lead time. I select L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures longer-than-promised arrivals). For demand parameters I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full sample history while the backend's capped ordering will limit order sizes given existing large in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show majority actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained longer-than-promised). On-hand is 0 with large in-transit = 484 (so pipeline exists but arrivals have historically been delayed). To be conservative on service level while reflecting current reduced demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses measured average; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (last 5 periods of demand are lower/more volatile). This balances holding cost vs stockouts given long/variable lead times and current low demand.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from available demand samples (keeps forecast anchored to historical mean while accounting for longer L).

Large in-transit stock suggests outstanding orders will cover multiple periods of demand even if lead time=3. To capture realized lead-time behavior I select L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times. For demand I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively\u2014this leverages the full sample set while letting the adjusted L inflate the review+lead demand and risk buffer appropriately given delayed arrivals and high profit vs holding cost (profit=19, holding=1) to balance service level and carrying costs.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded lead times show a sustained shift to 3 periods (majority 3s, avg ~2.25 from prior evidence). To avoid underordering given delayed arrivals and large pipeline, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service (higher target stock for longer L) versus holding cost while letting OR engine apply its profit-based z* and cap.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent longer-than-promised lead times (majority 3 periods). Use 'calculate' for L so backend averages observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples; this keeps forecast anchored to full sample history while the backend's base-stock formula balances profit vs holding cost given our lead-time estimate. This approach acknowledges overdue shipments (large in-transit) and avoids overreacting to recent zero on-hand sales caused by delayed arrivals.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=484 (large pipeline; many prior orders outstanding). Historical concluded lead times show a sustained shift toward 3-period arrivals (majority 3s in recent observed lead times), so I set L to use recent lead-time observations. Demand since Period_19 shows a stable post-stockout regime; to capture the current demand level and recent variability I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with a 20-period window to balance responsiveness and noise. These choices raise the forecasted review+lead demand and volatility to protect service given long/variable lead times while the capped order cap will limit excessive single-period receipts and holding cost exposure.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical demand samples (provided) mean=134.6 units/period; observed conclude history shows frequent 3-period actual lead times (majority earlier). Many past shipments arrived with lead_time=3, and long in-transit balance suggests shipments are delayed vs promised. To protect service given likely L=3, I choose L explicit=3 (conservative vs promised 2). With L=3 I set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*mean(all samples)=4*134.6=538.4 to cover four periods of demand. I keep sigma_hat as default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to size safety stock; this balances high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) by increasing target inventory to avoid stockouts when lead time is longer than promised.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=683. Historical concluded lead-times show sustained longer-than-promised delays (majority 3 periods). To avoid stockouts despite delayed arrivals use explicit L=3. Demand recently resumed after long zeros; use recent_N=5 to capture current demand level (periods 41-45) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock reflects near-term demand. Large pipeline reduces urgency to inflate mu_hat; this configuration balances service vs. holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47. On-hand=0, in-transit=683 \u2014 large pipeline but past concludes show many shipments arriving with lead_times > promised (history shows multiple 3-period arrivals). Demand history after Period_5 is lower and variable. I choose L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures sustained longer-than-promised lead times). For demand I use 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the model balance service level vs holding cost given the inferred lead time and full-sample demand stats. No explicit escalation to higher safety stock because substantial in-transit (683) already covers several periods of demand; relying on backend caps to avoid over-ordering.

LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=0, in-transit=683. Historical concluded lead-times show majority 3 periods (sustained longer-than-promised delays), so I set lead time explicitly to 3 to avoid underordering. Use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) with L=3; this leverages full history while the explicit L protects against lost/delayed shipments and balances service vs. holding costs given large in-transit volume.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=683. Historical concluded lead times show a persistent bias toward longer deliveries (many observed =3). Demand samples provided (seed) are the five samples in dataset. To account for observed lead-time variability I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with the chosen L and the full sample set; this balances service level (capturing longer empirical L) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Many prior orders remain in-transit/overdue, so use an explicit L=3 to reflect observed reality. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand across review+lead using all available samples (conservative pooling given limited recent stable regime), balancing high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by letting OR engine set safety stock from full-sample mean/variance under L=3.
