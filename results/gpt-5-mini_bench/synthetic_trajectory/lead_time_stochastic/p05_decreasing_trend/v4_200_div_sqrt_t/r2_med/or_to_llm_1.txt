{
  "rationale": "History shows actual lead time fluctuated (observed 1\u20133 periods) and earlier periods revealed unreliable/lost shipments; treat pipeline as partially unreliable but currently large. Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=539. Recent realized single-period demand since the confirmed regime shift (Periods 29\u201349) averages ~40 units/day; (L+1)=3 \u2192 expected demand over protection horizon \u2248 120 units. With 539 in-transit (>4\xd7 the 3-period demand) placing any new order risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) and possible excess if shipments eventually arrive. OR recommends 0; I concur given high pipeline and persistent lower-demand regime. Therefore place 0 units to avoid increasing holding cost while awaiting in-transit arrivals and observing actual lead-time behavior.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR (0 units): in-transit=539 >> ~120 units needed for next 3 periods (demand \u224840/day), so ordering would raise holding cost unnecessarily amid unreliable lead times.",
