Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time shifts. Use promised lead time (default=2) and default demand estimates based on all historical samples (Periods 1-5) to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap. This balances service level (protects against stockout given zero inventory) while keeping holding cost conservative because holding cost is low relative to profit.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=166 (order placed P1 not yet arrived). No concluded arrivals beyond P1, so actual lead time cannot be inferred yet and there is no evidence of lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default=2). Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR engine produces a base-stock covering (1+L) periods; this is conservative given the outstanding in-transit units and limited history.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_3. On-hand=0, in-transit=332 (orders from P1 and P2). No 'arrived' conclude messages yet for those orders\u2014this is consistent with promised lead time=2 (orders placed in P1/P2 would arrive during Period_3 and only be visible in Period_4 conclude). No sustained changepoint in demand (historical samples: 130,147,128,116,161). I therefore keep lead time at the promised default to avoid overreacting to normal arrival timing. Use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost with standard statistical inputs while accounting for the 2-period review+lead window.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=456; historical demand samples mean=136.4 (samples:130,147,128,116,161). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (166,166,124) have not concluded (arrived=0) by Period_3 conclude, so shipments appear delayed but no concluded arrivals to formally change lead-time. Be conservative: keep L at promised (default) because lead-time change is not yet confirmed by any conclude message. Use default demand estimates to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples so the backend balances service level vs holding cost given current uncertainty and large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: Period_1-3 orders (166, 166, 124) all show arrived=0 by Period_3 conclude \u2014 3 consecutive unarrived shipments; suspect lead time >2 or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2850.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Context: on-hand=133, in-transit=166. Concluded history shows arrivals in Period 4: 166 units (ordered P1, lead_time=3) and 124 units (ordered P3, lead_time=1) \u2014 lead times variable but average =2, and earlier suspected missing shipments have some arrivals so no sustained loss signal. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed variability). For demand forecast I choose mu_hat='default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) since recent demand (130,147,128,116,161) shows no sustained regime shift. For uncertainty I choose sigma_hat='default' (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These settings balance service level vs holding cost while accounting for observed lead-time variability.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=331 (likely P2=166 + P5=165). Historical concluded lead times: observed W=3 (P1\u2192arrived P4) and W=1 (P3\u2192arrived P4) \u2014 mixed evidence of variable/longer lead times and at least one delayed shipment. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) average = (130+147+128+116+161)/5 = 136.4. To account for observed variability in lead time, use calculate for L (average of observed lead times) so backend estimates lead time from concluded data. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend scales demand over (1+L) periods using the full sample set; this balances service level given delayed arrivals while avoiding overfitting to short noisy recent swings.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=495; recent concludes show variable actual lead times (observed W={3 (P1->P4),1 (P3->P4)}) and recent orders (P5,P6) still unarrived. Given mixed lead-time evidence but at least one long shipment (W=3), use calculated average lead time to let backend incorporate observed variability. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples) and default sigma to leverage full sample set for stability while L is updated. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead time) against holding cost.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8. Recent demand samples average ~138 (periods 1-5: 130,147,128,116,161; later periods show similar mid-130s). On-hand=0, in-transit=600 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show mixed actual lead times: arrival record in Period_4 indicates an order placed in Period_1 had lead_time=3 and an order placed in Period_3 had lead_time=1; later placed orders (P5-P7) have not concluded yet. Given this, I use 'calculate' for L so the backend averages observed lead times (captures variability vs promised=2). For demand parameters I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples; with a large in-transit pipeline and holding cost low relative to profit, this balances service level and holding cost while letting the OR engine incorporate the inferred lead time and historical demand.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times vary: Period_4 conclude shows P1->lead_time=3 and P3->lead_time=1; average observed lead_time=2 (evidence: P1 arrival at P4, P3 arrival at P4).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=124, in-transit=344. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed lead_times = 3,1,3,1 \u2192 average 2). Several early shipments were delayed/lost but recent pattern averages to 2. To reflect observed lead-time behavior I set L='calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. Demand forecast and uncertainty use defaults so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (respect observed longer/mixed lead times) against holding cost without overfitting short-term noise from alternating arrivals.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Recent history shows variable actual lead times (observed 1 and 3) with average ~2; on-hand=28 and in-transit=476 (large pipeline). There are no new conclude messages beyond Period 9 to indicate further lead-time drift or lost shipments. To let the OR engine incorporate observed lead-time data, set L to calculate (use average observed lead times). Demand forecast and uncertainty will use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend computes base_stock and cap using full sample history; this balances service (given large pipeline and evidence of longer-than-promised arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 context: recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed: P1->3, P3->1, P5->3, P7->1, P8->1) averaging ~1.8 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=549 \u2014 large pipeline but history shows shipments sometimes delayed or arrive with lead=1 or 3. I therefore let the backend compute L from observed lead times (method=calculate) so the OR engine uses realized lead-time evidence. Demand shows no sustained regime shift (recent 10-period mean ~137.6), so use default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These choices let the optimizer set base-stock and caps using empirical lead-time while keeping demand estimate stable given no clear, sustained demand change, balancing service level against holding cost despite intermittent delays.

Given multiple mixed but centering around 2, set L using calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level vs holding cost while respecting inferred slightly longer/variable lead time and large in-transit inventory.

To let the OR engine internalize observed lead-time variability, set L via calculate (use average of observed lead times).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 14: on-hand=0, in-transit=466. Historical concluded lead times = [3,1,3,1,3,2] (avg\u22482.17) \u2014 evidence of variable/longer-than-promised lead times and some delayed shipments but no new sustained regime change. I set L=calculate so backend uses the average observed lead time from concluded messages. Demand history samplings show moderate variability; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend's base-stock balances profit vs holding cost while accounting for the longer inferred lead time. This preserves service level given the in-transit stock while avoiding excess holding if some shipments are lost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=531. Historical concluded lead times show variability but average > promised. Observed lead times (from conclude messages) = {3,1,3,1,3,2,3} \u2192 mean\u22482.29, so use calculated average lead time to capture real delivery pace. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock from full sample mean/std scaled by chosen L. This balances service (by increasing implied lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and variable arrivals.

Historical conclude messages show variable lead times (observed sample lead_times: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3; average \u22482.29) and multiple delayed/lost arrivals earlier; to capture realized lead-time variability I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time (calculate). I use default demand (mu_hat) and uncertainty (sigma_hat) so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, keeping forecasting stable while the backend incorporates the computed L. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=2, in-transit=413. Historical concluded arrivals show variable but recent persistence of 3-period lead times (several orders arriving after 3 periods) with some 1-2 period arrivals earlier. To be conservative vs. missing/late shipments, I estimate lead time from the most recent observed lead times (N=5). Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples given stable demand samples available. This raises the pipeline coverage while letting the OR engine set safety stock using profit/holding tradeoff, mitigating stockouts from suspected prolonged lead times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: ordered Period_9->arrived Period_12 (LT=3), Period_11->arrived Period_14 (LT=3), Period_13->arrived Period_16 (LT=3))

Daily Reward (R_t): $1444.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: recent concludes (Periods 12,14,16,17) consistently show arrivals with lead_time=3 (orders placed P9,P11,P13,P14 arrived after 3 periods) \u2014 actual lead time is confirmed at 3. On-hand=0, in-transit=462 (multiple outstanding shipments). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the backend forecasts across the correct review+lead horizon. Demand has shown no abrupt drop; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 13\u201317) so the base-stock and safety stock reflect current demand level and volatility while avoiding overweighting older data. This balances service (higher lead time requires higher coverage) against holding cost by basing safety on recent demand variability.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=537. Historical arrivals show consistent lead_time=3 evidence (P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16) and earlier missing/delayed shipments. Use calculated lead time to capture observed LT=3; use default demand sizing and default volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so orders reflect the confirmed longer lead time and preserve service while avoiding excessive manual tuning.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=538. Historical concludes show lead_time=3 confirmed (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). Using L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed LT=3. Demand recently averaged \u2248116.4 (Periods 15-19); with review+lead horizon (1+L)=4 this implies mu_hat based on recent 5 samples to capture latest regime. Variability also set from the same recent 5 samples. With these settings the OR backend will size base-stock for 4 periods of recent demand and account for observed volatility; current pipeline (538) already exceeds the target, so no urgent replenishment needed and holding cost is kept low.

Given confirmed LT=3 and sizable pipeline, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans over the correct review+lead horizon. Use default demand estimators (mu_hat and sigma_hat default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (longer coverage with L=3) against holding cost given high profit vs low holding cost.

On-hand = 0, in-transit = 586 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals will occur with LT=3. To ensure OR backend accounts for the longer realized lead time, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples, balancing service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

To capture realized lead-time variability I let L be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average concluded Ls). Demand samples are limited and show no sustained regime shift, so use default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)).

Period_24: recent demand samples (Periods1-5 shown historically avg ~ 136) with volatile arrivals; on-hand=0, in-transit=538 so pipeline is large and no urgent ordering needed. Historical concluded lead times are variable (observed values: 3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,3,2 \u2192 avg\u22482.27) so use calculated average lead time to reflect empirical LT. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples given no clear recent demand regime shift. This balances service level (using observed LT) against holding cost given large in-transit stock and avoids overreacting to short-term noise.

Current period 25: on-hand=0, in-transit=538. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sample average \u22482.2 with multiple 3-period arrivals and some 1\u20132). Several earlier shipments were delayed/lost but recent evidence includes many LT=3 observations. To let the OR engine adjust for the observed mixed/longer lead times, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average concluded Ls). Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing stability given noisy recent demand and large pipeline. This balances service (by increasing implied coverage when calculated L>2) versus holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Recent conclues show a sustained LT=3 signal (multiple orders observed with LT=3, including Periods 9->12,11->14,13->16) so I set lead time to 3. On-hand=0, in-transit=538 (ample pipeline). Demand samples mean=136.4; using default mu_hat yields (1+L)*mean = 4*136.4 to cover review+lead demand. Volatility: use default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect observed variability. These choices acknowledge confirmed longer LT, rely on full-sample demand estimates (no recent demand regime detected), and leverage large in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering while maintaining service with modest safety stock.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) average 136.4 units; on-hand=0, in-transit=577 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period arrivals and some 1\u20132 period arrivals; evidence since Period 17 confirms sustained 3-period lead time but overall observed lead times average \u22482.27. I set L to "calculate" so the backend computes the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures the shift toward LT\u22483 while using full evidence). I use "default" for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level (captures longer effective lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=577. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed lead-time=3 observations (P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16) and earlier intermittent 3-period arrivals after missing shipments. Given sustained evidence of LT=3, set lead time explicitly to 3 to ensure pipeline coverage. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this balances service (longer L) against holding cost while addressing prior lost/delayed shipments by assuming the longer observed lead time.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: recent demand samples average 136.4/unit (Periods 1\u20135). On-hand=0, in-transit=538 \u2014 substantial pipeline but past history shows variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133, with multiple confirmed LT=3 events). Use calculated average lead time from observed conclues to let backend infer current LT from evidence. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on chosen L; this balances service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost while relying on pipeline coverage to meet near-term demand.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=538. Historical concludes show multiple lead_time=3 observations (Periods 12,14,16,17 arrivals) suggesting actual lead time longer than promised; several earlier missing shipments resolved with LT=3. To be conservative and let backend incorporate all observed lead-time evidence, set L via 'calculate' (average observed lead times). Demand forecast and uncertainty use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost using the full sample history while accounting for the inferred longer lead time.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=538. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 4,8,12,16,17) show a persistent 3-period lead time signal (Period_9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16 and earlier cluster). Multiple earlier missing arrivals and subsequent arrivals confirm actual LT\u22483 rather than promised 2. To ensure pipeline covers the longer transit and avoid stockouts given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1), I set L explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which scales safety stock with the longer lead time and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=571. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with multiple confirmed LT=3 observations (Periods 12\u201317) plus some LT=2 later; no new sustained shift. Use calculated L to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand across review+lead based on full sample set (stable sample size, no recent demand regime shift). This balances service (capture observed longer L) vs holding cost by letting backend set safety stock from profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent history shows variable, sometimes-long lead times (observed L=1,2,3 across concluded arrivals) and several earlier multi-period delayed shipments; on-hand=0, in-transit=538 (large pipeline). I choose to let backend infer an empirical lead time average from concluded arrivals (method=calculate) rather than trusting the promised LT, and use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using observed average LT) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit volume and uncertain recent LT variability.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: recent history shows multiple confirmed 3-period lead-time arrivals (Periods 9->12,11->14,13->16) and many delayed shipments earlier; on-hand=0, in-transit=538 (large pipeline). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the sustained actual LT=3 signal. With L=3 I use default demand estimates so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps forecasting conservative given confirmed longer lead time while letting the OR engine size safety stock from full-sample stats; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35. On-hand=0, in-transit=563. Historical concluded arrivals show varying lead times (multiple LT=3 events around Periods 12\u201317 plus later LT=1\u20132 observations); average of all observed lead times \u22482.15 so I let the backend compute the observed average (calculate). For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to let the OR engine compute appropriate base-stock and cap given the inferred lead time. This balances higher safety stock from longer inferred lead time against holding cost while the large in-transit pipeline (563) will be considered by the backend when sizing the order.

LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=563. Historical conclude messages show sustained lead-time=3 evidence (multiple orders observed with LT=3, see Periods 12,16,17). To account for persistent longer-than-promised deliveries and avoid under-ordering, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand history, capturing the longer replenishment horizon and preserving the OR engine's bias toward higher safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Given mixed observations but sustained evidence of longer lead times, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend averages empirical values. Use default demand/volatility methods so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR engine incorporate full sample history. This balances service level (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost while acknowledging in-transit stock and possible delayed arrivals.

Period_38: on-hand=0, in-transit=538. Historical conclude messages repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 (e.g., Period9->arrived Period12, Period11->arrived Period14, Period13->arrived Period16). Multiple multi-period arrivals and earlier missing shipments indicate promised L=2 is too short; use explicit L=3. Use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples (with L=3) \u2014 this raises the base-stock to cover L+1 periods of demand and offsets observed delayed/lost shipments while letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost.

Period_39: recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times with multiple confirmed 3-period observations (historic evidence through Period_17) but overall average of observed lead times \u22482.08. On-hand=0, in-transit=556 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists, so we should use an empirically averaged lead time. Set L by calculating average of observed lead times to capture historical variability (backend will compute \u22482.08). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this leverages full-sample demand stats while the computed L accounts for protracted/delayed arrivals. This balances service (using longer inferred lead time to cover demand during transit) against holding costs given large in-transit inventory.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: recent demand ~100\u2013140 units/period (history shows variability but no new sustained regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=538 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers multiple periods. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16). Because actual LT has been persistently 3, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans for (1+L)=4 periods of demand. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), leveraging the full sample history; this balances service level (by expanding review+lead coverage due to longer LT) versus holding cost given we already have large in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: demand history shows moderate, variable weekly demand (recent concluded demands mostly 60\u2013140). On-hand=0, in-transit=554 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages (Periods 12\u201317 and earlier) confirm a sustained lead time of 3 periods; multiple orders observed with LT=3. To ensure the OR engine plans for the longer transport time, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level (longer coverage with L=3) against holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=554. History shows variable but persistent multi-period deliveries (observed lead times 1\u20133, with earlier confirmed 3-period episodes). Large in-transit balance suggests many outstanding shipments; lead time uncertain. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times from concluded history (captures true recent variability). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are computed from full sample set\u2014this balances service level given profit/holding cost and lets the OR engine cap orders appropriately while accounting for inferred lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=554. Historical concludes show persistent variable but recently frequent LT=3 (confirmed earlier P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16). To capture realized lead-time shifts use calculate for L (backend will average observed lead times). Demand has fallen recently (last 5 demands: 40,73,63,58,63 \u2192 mean\u224859.4), so use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead time) against holding cost by forecasting demand over (1+L) using recent behavior rather than long-run higher means, and by using recent volatility for safety stock.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=538. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead_time=3 (e.g., P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16, P40->P43) so I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the sustained longer LT and avoid under-ordering. Use default demand/volatility methods so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, leveraging full sample history while accounting for the longer effective review+lead period. This balances higher service-level needs from long lead times against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=545. Historical conclude messages show multiple multi-period arrivals and a sustained pattern of 3-period arrivals (confirmed at Period_17), so use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. Recent demand (Periods 40-44 = 63,58,63,61,79) appears representative of current regime; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over those 5 most recent demands. This balances service (capture the recent demand level) with holding cost by not overreacting to older high-demand spikes and by letting the backend incorporate the computed L.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. Recent concluded history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133) with average ~2.2; there is substantial in-transit stock (545) and on-hand=0. Demand historical sample mean (seed data) = 136.4 units/period. I choose L by "calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20133 variability). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select "default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (using observed longer average lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and the profit/holding cost ratio.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=545. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with multiple confirmations of LT=3 (notably Period_9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16) so actual lead time appears longer than the promised 2. I select L='calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (captures mixed LTs including confirmed 3s). For demand parameters I choose default formulas so mu_hat and sigma_hat use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples respectively \u2014 this balances service level (accounts for longer inferred lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=545. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (confirmed at Period_17 with multiple orders arriving after 3 periods) and many delayed/lost shipments when assuming promised L=2. To address the sustained shift to a longer lead time, I set L explicitly=3 so the OR backend plans across the correct review+lead horizon. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (now using L=3) which balances service level (higher demand coverage for longer LT) against holding cost given high profit per unit.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49. On-hand=0, in-transit=545. Historical conclude messages (Period_12,17 and others) repeatedly show orders arriving with lead_time=3 (e.g., P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16); treat actual lead time as 3. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed LT=3 and avoid under-ordering given large in-transit and delayed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, increasing coverage for the longer lead time while letting the OR engine trade off service level vs holding cost.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=545. Historical arrivals show variable lead times but earlier sustained evidence confirmed LT=3 (Period_17). Recent arrivals remain mixed; to be responsive I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times (recent_N=5). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7sample mean and volatility from full history so forecasts remain grounded in long-run demand while the chosen L captures recent transport variability. With in-transit=545 the pipeline currently covers multiple periods of demand; this choice prevents over-ordering if late arrivals are genuine while preserving service level given high profit vs holding cost.
