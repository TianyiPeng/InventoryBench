Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Recent sample demand for chips(Regular): [130,147,128,116,161], mean=136.4, std\u224815.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. Use default lead time (promised L=2) because no observed lead-time changepoints. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost with no regime shift detected. This ensures orders cover the review+lead period demand given current lack of pipeline.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=166 (ordered P1, arrived=0 in P1 conclude). Promised lead time=2; with L=2 an order placed in P1 would arrive during Period_3, so no late-arrival evidence yet. Historical demand samples available (Periods 1\u20135). I choose default lead time and default demand/statistics so backend uses promised L=2 and full-sample mean/std to compute base stock, balancing profit vs holding cost conservatively given no confirmed changepoint or lost shipment.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=340 (orders placed but not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals contradicting promised lead time; insufficient evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change. Use default lead time (promised=2). Use default demand estimates (no recent changepoint detected) so mu_hat and sigma_hat set to defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock while accounting for pipeline.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=426 (matches prior orders 166+174+86). No concluded arrivals in history (all arrived=0), so there is no confirmed change to actual lead time\u2014cannot infer longer lead time or losses yet. Use promised lead time (default) and demand estimates based on full-sample historical data: default mu_hat and default sigma_hat. This keeps the OR backend using (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, providing a balanced service level while avoiding premature increases to forecast or safety stock given lack of confirmed regime/lead-time shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-28.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5): [130,147,128,116,161], mean=136.4. Current inventory: on-hand=140, in-transit=174 (includes overdue shipment: Period_2 order 174 has not concluded by Period_4, suggesting delay/loss risk). Observed concluded lead times: order on P1 arrived in P4 (lead_time=3), order on P3 arrived in P4 (lead_time=1) \u2192 average observed = 2. To be robust to the observed variability and overdue shipments, set L by calculating average observed lead time so OR backend recognizes actual lead-time signal. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L); this balances service level (higher mu_hat with L=calculated) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=342 (likely orders from P2 and P5). Historical demand samples mean=136.4 (Periods 1-5). Observed concluded lead times: P4 showed arrivals for orders from P1 (lead_time=3) and P3 (lead_time=1) -> observed lead times = {3,1}. Evidence is limited and not a sustained shift, so use calculated average lead time to let backend incorporate observed lead-time history. Set L by calculate to reflect observed lead-time average; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=510 (orders from P2,P5,P6). Historical demands = [130,147,128,116,161] (mean=136.4). Observed concluded lead times: P1->P4 = 3, P3->P4 = 1 \u2192 average = 2. P2 order remains overdue (no arrival yet) indicating lead-time variability/delays but insufficient sustained evidence to change promised default. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (2) so the backend accounts for observed variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples (robust given limited data). This balances service level vs holding cost while acknowledging in-transit backlog and intermittent delays.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=556. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times: order on P1 arrived in P4 (LT=3) and order on P3 arrived in P4 (LT=1). Evidence is limited but centers around LT around 2, so set L method to calculate (backend will average observed lead times). Demand history shows no sustained regime shift (samples consistent with baseline data), so use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine set base-stock while accounting for the inferred lead time. This balances service (using observed LT) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Daily Profit: $133.00, Daily Holding Cost: $81.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean ~ 136.4 with moderate variability. On-hand=81 + in-transit=352 => pipeline large (433) which covers many periods of expected demand. Observed arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 3 periods) but average ~2; some shipments were delayed to 3 periods intermittently. To be robust while letting the OR backend compute the demand forecast consistent with promised lead-time policy, set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default demand/volatility calculations so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (given large pipeline and variable lead times) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods (arrivals from Periods 1,3,5,7 gave lead times 3,1,3,1); average observed lead time = 2 over P4\u2013P8.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent demand average ~136.4 units; observed lead times alternate (1 and 3) with mean ~1.8 \u2192 use calculated average lead time to reflect realized behavior. On-hand=0, in-transit=473 (large pipeline) \u2014 pipeline already exceeds any reasonable base stock so we should not boost forecast. Set L by calculate to let backend use observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This yields a base-stock aligned to realized lead time while the large in-transit stock will drive orders to zero, avoiding excess holding costs.

Demand samples (periods 1\u20135): [130,147,128,116,161], mean=136.4. I select L=calculate to let backend use observed average lead time; mu_hat=default to set (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures review+lead demand given inferred L); sigma_hat=default to scale historical volatility for the same horizon. This balances service (using observed longer average lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging in-transit inventory may include delayed shipments.

Historical concluded arrivals show alternating lead times of 1 and 3 (observed sequence 3,1,3,1,1 \u2192 avg \u22482), so actual lead time evidence centers on 2 periods but shipments are noisy/delayed. Use calculated average lead time to let backend reconcile observed variability. For demand, use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so OR engine applies its standard safety-stock cap; this balances service (profit=holding \u2192 equal) while avoiding overreacting to intermittent lost/delayed shipments.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical arrivals show alternating lead times of 1 and 3 (observed P4\u2013P8, avg=2), and several delayed/no arrivals earlier. Set L to 'calculate' to use observed average lead time rather than promised. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to leverage full demand history given no confirmed demand regime shift; this gives the OR engine a stable forecast while the calculated L accounts for the actual slower/variable pipeline so orders will be sized to cover (1+L) periods of demand and avoid stockouts given current in-transit volume.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_15: recent observed lead times alternate between 1 and 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals across P4\u2013P12) giving an average >2; on-hand=0, in-transit=481 (substantial pipeline). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture the alternating/longer-than-promised behavior. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, keeping forecasts grounded in full historic demand while the calculated L inflates the review+lead demand to account for delayed arrivals and reduce stockouts.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed lead times: 3,1,3,1,1,3,2 \u2192 avg=2). On-hand=0, in-transit=481 which already covers multiple lead+review periods vs. expected demand. I set L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full sample history while the calculated L accounts for the alternating delays. With large in-transit inventory, this avoids over-ordering while matching service/holding cost tradeoff.

Given this confirmed variability and average near 2, set L using observed average (calculate). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with large pipeline already in transit this avoids overreacting to recent stockouts while accounting for longer effective lead time.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18. On-hand=0, in-transit=425. Historical concluded arrivals show alternating lead times (1 and 3) with average \u22482; pipeline is large (425) so risk of overstock is moderate given profit=holding. I choose to let backend infer lead time from observed concludes (calculate) to capture the alternating pattern into an average L\u22482. For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this keeps parameters grounded in full-sample stats and avoids overreacting to recent noise while the large pipeline clears. These settings balance service level vs holding cost given uncertain, alternating lead times and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period_19: recent demand samples (130,147,128,116,161) show mean=136.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=470 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals have been irregular (observed lead times vary between 1\u20133). I choose to let backend infer lead time from observed history (calculate) so L reflects average observed lead time. For demand and volatility I use default aggregations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base_stock and cap using full sample statistics; this balances service level given pipeline uncertainty and avoids overfitting short swings. No new sustained shipment/seasonal signal to record.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded lead times show alternating 1/3 but recent concludes (Periods 12,16,17) skew to 3 \u2014 I therefore estimate lead time from the most recent observations. Given large pipeline inventory, use demand default forecasting to avoid overreacting to noise. Methods: L -> recent_N (N=5) to capture recent lead-time pattern; mu_hat -> default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) so OR engine scales order to historical demand; sigma_hat -> default to provide standard uncertainty scaling. This balances service (longer recent lead times) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock and possible delayed arrivals.

On-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded arrivals show alternating lead times (observed W: 3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3,3; avg \u22482.22). There are many in-transit units but lead time uncertainty and some delayed/lost arrivals exist; therefore I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate) and use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts use all available samples. This balances service (accounting for longer/variable lead times) against holding cost by basing base-stock on full-sample mean/variance and observed lead-time average.

Use calculated lead time to let backend infer average observed LT. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses full sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L) \u2014 this balances service level given the large in-transit pipeline while avoiding overreacting to noisy recent arrivals.

Period_23: recent history shows alternating lead times (observed average ~2 over P4\u2013P8) and long sequences of zero visible arrivals afterward; on-hand=0, in-transit=472 so substantial pipeline exists but actual arrival timing uncertain. I choose L=calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures the alternating 1/3 pattern). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1) and the uncertain arrival timing. This approach avoids overreacting to recent noisy shortages while acknowledging lead-time evidence.

To be conservative given mixed evidence and large in-transit pipeline, use calculated average lead time so backend learns observed LT pattern; use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost using full-sample stats while accounting for inferred L.

Use default demand/statistics scaling so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples: this leverages full sample history (Period_1\u20135 data) and keeps parameters stable given noisy/alternating lead times.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded arrivals show inconsistent lead times (1,2,3) with an alternating 1/3 pattern earlier; demand has shifted down since ~Period_10 and the last 17 periods show a lower, sustained mean (~111). I choose L='calculate' so the backend infers the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures the alternating/variable lead-time behavior). For demand I use recent_N, N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the sustained recent regime (reduces target base-stock vs. legacy high demand). These choices balance service (by reflecting actual lead-time variability) against holding cost (by using recent lower mean demand and its recent volatility).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 10: avg demand decreased from ~136.4 (Periods 1-5) to ~111.1 (Periods 10-26), \u2212\u224819%

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); use observed-average lead time. Demand dropped ~19% after Period_10 (already recorded). To reflect the lower recent demand, set mu_hat using recent samples since the regime shift. Choose recent_N=18 (Periods 10\u201327 available = 18 samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the post-shift regime. L set to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times from concluded messages, which captures the alternating 1/3 pattern (avg\u22482) and occasional 2/3 observations. This balances service (using recent lower demand) against holding cost while acknowledging lead-time variability and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical demand samples mean \u2248 (130+147+128+116+161)/5 = 136.4, prior carry-over noted a sustained demand downshift from ~136.4 to ~111.1 around Period 10. Observed lead times historically alternate (1 and 3) with average \u22482. I choose L by 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full sample set. This keeps forecast conservative given mixed lead-time signals and existing in-transit stock, letting OR engine balance service vs holding costs without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 10 (previous insight). On-hand=0, in-transit=472 (large pipeline of earlier orders; many arrivals have been delayed historically with alternating 1/3 lead times). Use observed lead-time history rather than promised to capture delays: set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand forecast should focus on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 5 periods' lower demand (Periods 25-29) so orders don't overshoot given large in-transit volume. This balances service vs. holding cost by shrinking target base-stock to recent demand and accounting for observed longer/variable lead times.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded arrivals show alternating lead times (1 and 3) with average \u22482; use calculated average lead time. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period_10; recent demand (Periods 26-30 = 94,106,88,67,97) averages ~90.4 \u2014 use recent_N=5 for mean and volatility so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the current lower-demand regime and avoid overstating replenishment given large in-transit volume. These choices keep target base stock aligned with observed lead time and recent lower demand, reducing holding risk while preserving service given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded lead times alternate 1 and 3 (avg ~2) \u2014 use calculated average lead time to capture this pattern. Recent demand (Periods 27-31 = 106,88,67,97,63) is materially lower than early-period levels; use recent_N=5 to anchor mu_hat to the latest regime and reduce forecast bias. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This combination lets the OR engine size base_stock for the empirically observed lead time while keeping forecasts and safety stock responsive to the recent low-demand regime and current pipeline to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical conclues show variable lead times (1\u20133) with average near 2; many units are already in-transit so use calculated empirical lead time. Demand has trended down since Period_10; recent demand (Periods 28\u201332 = 88,67,97,63,57) is substantially below earlier regimes, so base forecast on the most recent 5 periods to avoid overstocking. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history, mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand, and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings reduce holding cost risk while covering expected near-term demand given current in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Current period 34: on-hand 0, in-transit 472. Historical concluded arrivals show varying lead times (1,2,3) with average ~2; demand has been in lower regime since Period 10 (~111 avg). Large in-transit stock reduces urgency to inflate forecasts. I set L=calculate so backend uses observed lead-time average from concluded data; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to reflect the full-sample demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders given current pipeline.

Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 10+), while the large in-transit pipeline will be considered by the OR backend when computing final orders.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (multiple 1\u20133 period observations; average >2) and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period_10 (~111 avg). To capture the observed longer-than-promised lead times, set L using calculated average of observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, which balances service (higher L raises required base stock) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37. On-hand=0, in-transit=472 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: recent arrivals show mostly 3s (recent 4 observed lead times average ~2.75) after earlier 1/3 alternation \u2014 choose recent_N (N=4) to bias L upward vs promised 2. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 10; recent demand (Periods 32\u201336) averages ~78 units \u2014 use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current lower mean and volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute (1+L)*recent mean and scaled std to balance service vs holding given the large in-transit pipeline and uncertain/lengthening lead times.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period_10 (~111 avg) vs earlier ~136; last 5 demands (Periods 34\u201338) are [80,94,80,108,?] with overall recent lower mean. On-hand=0, in-transit=472 (large pipeline) \u2014 some prior shipments showed alternating lead times (1\u20133) so actual lead time is uncertain. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed concluded lead times (avg \u22482) rather than the promised value, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the recent lower-demand regime and current variability. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the sustained lower demand while the large in-transit quantity reduces the immediate need to order, limiting holding cost exposure if shipments conclude as observed.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed lts = [3,1,3,1,1,3,2,3,3], avg\u22482.22) and a sustained lower-demand regime since ~Period_10. Several large in-transit quantities exist and some orders took 3 periods to arrive, so I use an empirically estimated lead time to reflect actual supplier behavior. I select L='calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time; mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). This approach is conservative to cover (L+1) periods of demand given the recorded multi-period arrivals and high in-transit volume while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy arrivals.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133), recent observed average lead time >2; multiple concluded arrivals exist but no new sustained demand regime shift since prior insight. I choose to let backend estimate lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate) so L reflects the observed variability. Demand forecast and uncertainty use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which balances service level given the large in-transit volume while avoiding extra holding cost from explicit higher safety stock here.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=472 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (recent mix of 3,2,1); to hedge I use a short recent average for L. Demand has been lower since Period 10 (~111 avg); recent 10-period demand is representative for forecast and volatility. Parameters chosen: L as recent_N (N=5) to reflect observed lead-time variability; mu_hat recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to measure recent volatility. This keeps base stock aligned with current lower demand while accounting for unstable lead times and large pipeline to avoid excessive holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42. On-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded lead times alternate 1 and 3 giving average ~2 (use calculate). Demand showed a sustained downward regime starting Period 10; I use recent_N over the latest regime to reflect current lower-demand behavior. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (recent 20 periods of the current regime) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and scales volatility to recent variance; this balances service (covers current lower-demand regime) vs. holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent demand historically lower since Period_10 (~111 avg vs ~136 earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=472 units (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times alternate 1 and 3 giving average ~2 \u2014 use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (this leverages full history while L reflects actual lead-time pattern). Large in-transit reduces need for aggressive ordering; these settings balance service vs holding cost given heavy pipeline and confirmed lead-time behavior.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_44. On-hand=0, in-transit=472. Past concluded arrivals show alternating lead times (1 and 3) averaging ~2; promised lead time=2. Demand exhibited a sustained downshift at Period 10 (lower regime since P10). I set L using observed average (calculate) to reflect actual variability rather than blindly trusting promise. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the current lower-demand regime (Periods 24\u201343 are recent within that regime) so mu_hat reflects the post-change mean across the review+lead horizon. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=20) to estimate volatility in the same recent regime. These choices balance service (by recognizing actual longer/variable lead behavior) against holding cost (by using recent lower-demand estimates rather than the early high-demand samples).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: recent demand regime is the lower-demand regime since Period_10 (avg ~111). On-hand=0, in-transit=472 (large pipeline covering multiple periods); several past orders showed variable lead times (1\u20133). I choose L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures mixed 1/3 pattern). For demand I use recent_N N=20 to base mu_hat on the most recent stable low-demand regime (covers up to 20 most recent samples, matching detected regime length). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep safety stock aligned to observed lead-time behavior while sizing target stock to the recent lower-demand regime, balancing service vs holding cost given holding=profit.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 with on-hand=0 and large in-transit=472. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times oscillated but average ~2; promised LT=2 is still appropriate. Demand dropped around Period 10 (carry-over) so I use recent data to capture the lower regime. I set L=default (use promised 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to compute (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility from the most recent regime-length window, so the OR engine targets inventory for the current lower-demand regime while accounting for observed variability and the 2-period promise. This balances service level (using recent demand) against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. Recent demand settled lower after the Period 10 regime shift (mean down ~19%). On-hand=0, in-transit=472 \u2014 substantial pipeline but many past arrivals in concludes showed alternating lead times (1 and 3); promised L=2 but actual lead times vary. Use L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history. For demand, use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-regime (Periods 10+) lower demand regime while smoothing short-term volatility. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (accounting for variable lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and lower recent demand.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48. Recent long stretch of lower demand since Period_10 (mean ~111 vs ~136 earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=472 units (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded lead times alternate 1 and 3 (avg ~2); promised lead time=2. To reflect confirmed lower-demand regime, I use recent demand samples rather than all-sample mean. I set L by calculating average of observed lead times (captures alternating 1/3 pattern). For demand forecast I use recent_N (last N=20) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime; same recent_N=20 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to current lower demand while L estimate accounts for observed lead-time variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given existing large pipeline.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concludes show variable lead times (1,2,3) with alternating 1 and 3 in early periods and multiple late arrivals missing/delayed; average observed lead time is ambiguous but roughly 2. Demand has been lower since Period 10 (carry-over insight). To let the OR engine learn actual lead time from observed arrivals, I set L=calculate (use observed average lead time). For demand forecasting I use default methods so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the engine combine long-run demand stats with the inferred lead time. This choice is conservative given large in-transit volume and uncertain/mixed arrival history: it lets the OR model target service level while relying on backend caps to avoid excessive single-period orders; using calculated L helps account for observed multi-period delays.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded lead times alternate (1 and 3) with average \u22482; several recent arrivals confirm variability and occasional 3-period delays. Demand history shows a sustained lower regime since Period 10. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend estimate average observed lead time from concluded data; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, which balances the reduced demand regime with observed lead-time variability and leverages the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering while maintaining service level.
