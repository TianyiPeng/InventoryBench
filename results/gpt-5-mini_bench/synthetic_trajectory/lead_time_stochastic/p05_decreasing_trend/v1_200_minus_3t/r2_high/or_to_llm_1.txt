{
  "rationale": "History shows frequent long/variable lead times and several lost shipments (Periods 2,6, >=25 cluster). We currently observe on-hand=0 and in-transit=2029, but the most recent conclude messages do not confirm arrivals for those in-transit units; past carry-over insight warned in-transit since Period 25 is unreliable until concluded. OR recommends 0 using promised L=2 and historical demand; given high profit relative to holding cost stocking is profitable only if arrivals are reliable. Because of substantial reported in-transit inventory (2029) that may still arrive and because ordering now would risk adding holding cost if the pipeline later concludes large deliveries, I will not place new orders this period. This minimizes holding cost exposure while awaiting confirmation in future conclude messages; reassess next period when arrivals (if any) are confirmed and update lead-time inference.",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Inventory & arrivals: On-hand=0, in-transit=2029. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times have varied (1\u20133 periods) and multiple past shipments were lost/delayed; carry-over notes already mark lost shipments since Periods 2,6 and suspicious pipeline since Period 25. Demand outlook: recent realized demand (Periods 39\u201349) averages \u224867 units/period with no sign of a sustained spike. Risk balance vs. OR: OR recommends 0 and uses promised L=2; given the large in-transit (2029 units) even if some fraction is delayed, it still covers many periods of expected demand (2029 / 67 \u2248 30 periods). Holding cost ($1/unit/period) would erode profit if we inflate inventory unnecessarily; profit per unit is $19 so OR's high service-level logic is already embedded but current pipeline is sufficient. Lead-time uncertainty argues for caution rather than topping up: ordering now could create excessive holding costs if outstanding shipments arrive. Decision: place 0 orders and wait for concluded arrival messages to verify which in-transit units actually arrive before ordering more. This follows OR recommendation while accounting for observed lead-time variability and current demand.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR's 0: in-transit=2029 covers ~30 periods of recent demand (~67/day) despite lead-time noise; avoid extra holding cost until arrivals are confirmed.",
