Inventory & demand analysis: recent empirical single-period mean from provided samples = 182 units. With actual L=3, required coverage = (L+1)\xd7mean = 4\xd7182 = 728 units. Current pipeline = in-transit 728 + on-hand 0 = 728, which exactly covers the (L+1)-period expected demand. OR recommended 0 units (it used promised L=2); adjusting for actual L=3 yields the same order need because pipeline equals required coverage. Final strategy: place 0 units to avoid additional holding cost since pipeline already meets the 4-period demand target and profit = holding cost, so extra inventory yields no net benefit and incurs holding cost.",
