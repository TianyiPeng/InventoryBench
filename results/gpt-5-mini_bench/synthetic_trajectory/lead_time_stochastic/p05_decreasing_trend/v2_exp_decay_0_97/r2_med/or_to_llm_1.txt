Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Inventory & arrivals: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 749. From history and carry-over insight, actual lead time is highly variable (1\u20133 periods) and some shipments can be delayed, but many outstanding in-transit orders eventually arrive. Demand outlook: sustained lower-regime demand since Period 24 (carry-over: avg ~72.1), recent periods remain low (typically ~30\u201380). Coverage calculation: using recent regime mean \u224875 units/period, in-transit 749 units covers \u224810 periods of demand even if some delays occur; using a conservative lower mean (\u224850) still covers \u224815 periods. Cost tradeoff: profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 high service fractile but holding cost is nontrivial; placing new orders risks incurring holding cost on top of large existing pipeline and potential further variability/loss. OR recommended 0 units (uses promised L and historical data). Given large pipeline and recent low demand, I will not place new orders now to avoid excess holding cost and to wait for pipeline to resolve (arrivals and any lost-order signals). Decision: order 0 units.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Declined OR already-recommended 0 change \u2014 with 749 units in transit and demand in the low-regime (~50\u201375/day), pipeline already covers many periods; avoid extra holding cost and wait for arrivals/lead-time confirmation.",
