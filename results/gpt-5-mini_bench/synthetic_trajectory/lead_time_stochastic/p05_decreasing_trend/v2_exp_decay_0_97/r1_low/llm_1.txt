Inventory/lead-time: on-hand=0, in-transit=525 (ordered P1). No concluded arrival for that order in Periods 1\u20133 conclude messages, so the P1 shipment is delayed or has an extended lead time; however per rules we only confirm lead-time changes with sustained evidence (3+ period confirmed arrival pattern), so do not assert a new lead time yet. Decision timing & lead-time implication: promised lead time=2 so any order placed now would arrive two periods after decision (too late to affect current demand). Profit vs holding: profit = $1/unit, holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 holding inventory erodes profit quickly (one period of holding eliminates the unit profit). Given a large in-transit quantity (525) that will likely arrive at some future period and the high holding cost equal to profit, placing additional orders risks increasing holding losses if arrivals overlap demand.
