Recent 3-period average (P3\u2013P5) = 131.3 units/period, noticeably above earlier levels. c) Lead time / orders: Supplier promised LT=2 periods; no concluded arrivals observed yet, so assume promised LT until contradicted. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Because arrivals occur after decision and LT=2, an order now must cover current period demand plus the next 2 periods (L+1=3 periods). e) Order logic: Use recent regime (131 units/period) \xd7 3 periods = ~394 units.

  "rationale": "a) World/product: chips are consumable with no calendar-specific spike indicated. b) Demand analysis: recent demand has accelerated sharply \u2014 P46\u2013P49 = [930,986,1036,1104], avg\u22481014, well above prior avg\u2248778 (P41\u2013P44). c) Lead time / in-transit: actual lead times have varied historically (1\u20133 periods) and some orders have been delayed; no new confirmed lead-time change in conclude messages. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0 but in-transit=4020 units. Decision must ensure coverage for (L+1)=3 periods of demand because orders placed now may arrive after \u22652 periods. Forecast current-period demand \u22481100\u20131170; 3-period coverage \u22483,300\u20133,510 units. In-transit 4,020 > required coverage, so existing pipeline should meet demand without placing new orders and avoids extra holding cost. e) Final action: place no order this period.",
