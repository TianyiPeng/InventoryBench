Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals observed; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so there are no overdue shipments. Use promised lead time (default) since no lead-time evidence exists. Demand history (Periods 1-5: 103,81,107,127,160) shows a mean ~115.6 but only 5 samples and no sustained changepoint, so use default aggregations: mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect full review+lead demand and sigma_hat default to reflect historical variability. This balances service level (captures recent higher values like 160) against holding cost conservatively given zero inventory.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=165; Period_1 conclude shows ordered=165 arrived=0 (no concluded arrivals yet). Promised lead time=2 and we have only one period of non-arrival \u2014 not enough sustained evidence of lost shipment or lead-time change. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand estimates based on all available historical samples to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (covering 1+L periods) against holding cost while we wait for further conclude messages to confirm any shipment issues or lead-time shifts.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3. Recent observed demands (history) show moderate variance; on-hand=0, in-transit=325 (orders from P1/P2). Promised lead time is 2 and no concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1/P2 would only conclude after arrivals are observed in later period concludes), so do not infer lead-time change or lost shipments. I select default lead time to keep promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances service level against holding cost given current info and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (orders placed P1=165, P2=160, P3=50) and no concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20133. Promised L=2 but shipments placed in P1\u2013P3 have not arrived by their expected conclude windows, indicating actual lead time is longer or shipments lost. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 to capture delayed arrivals when computing (1+L)-period demand. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost with the longer lead-time assumption.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (165, 160, 50 = 375 units) have produced zero arrivals by Period_3 conclude; suggests actual lead time \u22653 periods or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_5. Observed demand samples show an upward shift (last three periods: 107,127,160 vs full-sample mean 115.6). Inventory: on-hand=140, in-transit=273 (some past orders previously delayed). Lead-time evidence in concluded history: observed lead times = 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4) \u2014 mixed, so use data-driven average for L. Choices: L -> calculate to let backend use observed lead times average (captures mixed evidence without over-committing to promised 2). mu_hat -> recent_N with N=3 to capture the clear recent upward demand regime (uses (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples to raise target stock for higher recent demand). sigma_hat -> recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility rather than older lower-demand periods. These settings increase target base-stock to protect service during a confirmed recent demand rise while keeping lead-time estimate grounded in observed arrivals, helping the OR engine balance service level vs holding costs given delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $335.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: recent demand samples show mean=115.6 (periods 1\u20135) with last two demands 75,95 then 45 on-hand and in-transit=273. History shows mixed lead times (observed W=3 for P1 arrival, W=1 for P3) and one outstanding late shipment (P2 order still in-transit). I choose L="calculate" to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures observed variability and currently averages to 2). For demand sizing use mu_hat="default" so (1+L)*mean of all samples is applied (stable sample size, no strong recent changepoint). For uncertainty use sigma_hat="default" to scale sample std by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (covering review+lead demand) against holding cost given on-hand + large in-transit pipeline and uncertain late shipments.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=421. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (P1\u2192P4 lead_time=3; P3\u2192P4 lead_time=1) and several overdue/slow shipments (e.g., P2 order still not concluded). To balance uncertain lead time while avoiding overreaction to a single long arrival, I set L via 'calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times (captures both 3 and 1). Demand samples (103,81,107,127,160) are unchanged; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine produces a base-stock consistent with averaged lead-time and historical demand while capping order size to limit risk from potentially lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $452.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=358, recent demand shows uptick (last 3 samples: 107,127,160). Concluded arrivals reveal actual lead times of 3,1,3 (orders P1->P4, P3->P4, P4->P7). This suggests a persistent longer lead-time regime dominated by 3-period deliveries. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to let the backend average observed lead times and capture the current delivery reality. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to weight the higher recent demand (reduces stockouts during elevated demand). For volatility I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices raise base-stock to cover the (1+L) horizon and account for delayed arrivals, prioritizing service (profit per unit > holding cost) while keeping holding-risk reasonable given available in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period4; Period4 order arrived Period7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent history shows escalating demand (last 5 demands = 75,95,122,167,214; mean=134.6) and large pipeline (on-hand=0, in-transit=496). Concluded arrivals confirm lead time often =3 periods (evidence in Period_4 and Period_7 concludes) and some 1-period arrivals\u2014to be conservative set L=3 to cover observed delayed arrivals and avoid stockouts. I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the uptrend in the most recent regime (N=5 covers Periods 4\u20138). With (1+L)=4, mu_hat = 4\xd7recent mean to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std to reflect recent variability. This biases orders upward to protect service level given confirmed longer lead time while avoiding excessive holding by using recent demand samples rather than the full older history. No new lost-shipment pattern beyond existing lead-time confirmation.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand history shows elevated recent demand and volatility; to ensure service with confirmed longer LT, set lead time explicitly to 3 so the OR backend sizes orders for the longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging full history while accounting for L=3. No new sustained demand regime beyond the confirmed LT change.

Demand shows no sustained regime shift beyond historical samples; therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed deliveries. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a stable base-stock while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and avoiding overfitting to recent volatile arrivals.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=577. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=3 (arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7) and multiple early lost/delayed shipments. Recent demand has been elevated for ~6 periods (P6\u2013P11 demands: 122,167,214,199,125,189) so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher regime. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the last 6 observed demands, balancing service level needs against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=56, in-transit=474. Historical concluded lead times: {3,1,3,1,1,3,2} (avg=2.0). Pipeline (474) plus on-hand covers multiple periods but past long delays and some 3-period arrivals observed\u2014use inferred average lead time. Set L by calculating average observed lead time to reflect realized service delays. Use default demand calculations for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (stable sample size=5). This balances service (captures realized lead-time risk) against holding cost given moderate on-hand + large pipeline; no explicit upward adjustment to mu_hat needed now.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand is elevated (recent 5-period demands ~199,125,189,213,215) so I use a recent_N forecast to capture the current high-demand regime. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time so pipeline coverage matches reality. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target service with current demand while avoiding excessive holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=723. Past concludes show mixed lead times but earlier sustained evidence (P1->P4, P4->P7) and recent delayed arrivals justify conservatively using L=3 (explicit). Demand has trended up recently (Periods 10-14 demands = 125,189,213,215,202); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand based on the latest high-demand regime, improving service for frequent stockouts while the cap limits excess orders to control holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=8, in-transit=652 \u2014 substantial pipeline but actual lead time has been observed longer than promised (multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals). Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid under-ordering. For demand forecast, use recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (covers Periods 11-15). Use sigma recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher target stock for elevated demand and longer LT) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=813. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead-time observations (Period1\u21924, Period4\u21927, Period9\u219212, Period12\u219215) so I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid under-ordering. Demand samples available (103,81,107,127,160) show mean ~115.6; using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean = 4\xd7mean to cover review+lead demand. Sigma_hat left as default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, preserving observed volatility for safety given demand variability. This balances higher service level (larger base stock for L=3) against holding cost by relying on recent demand mean and default volatility.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent concluded history shows repeated 3-period arrivals (orders in P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P12\u2192P15, P14\u2192P17), indicating actual lead time = 3. On-hand=215, in-transit=459 \u21d2 healthy pipeline but actual LT>promised. I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to size orders for a 4-period coverage window. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (leveraging full history) to balance service (profit$4 vs holding$1) while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_19: recent history confirms actual lead time \u22483 periods (multiple observed arrivals with W=3). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=459 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are delayed relative to promised lead time historically. To protect service over the review+lead horizon while avoiding excess holding, I set L explicitly to 3 (reflecting observed behavior). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples (leveraging full-sample estimates); with L=3 this targets coverage over the 4-period demand window while the capped order rule will limit overly large single-period orders. This configuration balances service (accounting for confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=697. Historical conclude messages show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P12\u2192P15, P14\u2192P17). Recent demand is elevated vs early samples. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so OR pipeline calculations account for delayed arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 15\u201319 demands: 158,195,195,250,215) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples and sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices align ordering with the confirmed longer lead time and recent higher mean demand, reducing stockouts while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=0, in-transit=867. Recent demand samples show a rising/high pattern (last sample 324) and several large spikes (periods 18\u201320). Historical concluded arrivals indicate variable but frequently 3-period lead times; average of observed lead times is slightly above the promised 2. To reflect the empirically observed lead-time distribution while letting the OR engine apply its statistical base-stock formula, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level for the longer effective lead time against holding cost given current pipeline of 867 units.

Use calculated average lead time to capture realized supplier behavior; use default demand/volatility scaling so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 23 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=867, recent demand has been high and sustained (recent periods demands: 250,215,324,283,322). Historical conclude messages repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3). To protect service with confirmed longer lead time and capture recent high-demand regime, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the most recent five demand observations, which reflect the current elevated demand while limiting influence from older, lower-demand periods. This choice balances higher target inventory for service against holding cost given profit/holding ratio and the large in-transit balance and prior missing/ delayed shipments.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24. On-hand=0, in-transit=1025. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (evidence: orders P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P14\u2192P17, P20\u2192P23). Demand shifted up starting Period 12: Periods 12\u201323 demands = [213,215,202,158,195,195,250,215,324,283,322,329], avg=241.75. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (regime from Period 12 onward) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent -> 4*241.75 \u2248 967 (backend will compute). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=12 to capture current variance. With L=3 and mu_hat based on the elevated regime, the OR backend will size base-stock to cover four periods of the higher demand; current in-transit (~1025) roughly matches the 4-period demand forecast (~967), so no excessive additional ordering is required.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=1066. Recent demand has shifted materially higher (Periods 18\u201324: 250,215,324,283,322,329,286 \u2014 7 periods of high demand). Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 3-period lead times but some 1\u20132s; average observed lead time \u22482.18. I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded messages. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the new high-demand regime (use the last 7 concluded-period demands) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the sustained higher demand while accounting for current pipeline (1066 units) to avoid overstock given holding cost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 26: on-hand=3, in-transit=738. Historical concluded arrivals show variable but mostly multi-period lead times; average of observed lead times is best estimate. Recent demand (Periods 19\u201325) is persistently higher than early history, so forecast should use recent samples to capture the new regime. I set L using calculate (average observed lead times). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (Periods 19\u201325) to reflect the sustained high-demand regime; this increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts while sigma_hat from the same window captures realized volatility. These choices compensate for past delayed/lost shipments by increasing on-order coverage for the (1+L) review+lead horizon.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: avg demand \u2248 297.7 over Periods 19\u201325 (7 periods), sustained high demand

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime from Periods 19\u201325 (avg \u2248 297.7) and confirmed actual lead time = 3 (multiple observed P->P+3 arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=1067 (large pipeline). To match reality use explicit L=3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid underordering; use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (7 most recent post-shift samples) so the OR base-stock covers (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. This balances service level (protect against stockouts under higher demand and 3-period lead time) versus holding cost (uses recent data rather than all-time mean to avoid overstock from older low-demand periods).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: demand has been in a higher regime since Period 19 (sustained high weekly demands ~300+). On-hand=0, in-transit=1310 units \u2014 substantial pipeline. Historical concluded arrivals indicate variable but mostly multi-period lead times; I choose to let the backend compute the empiric average lead time from observed conclusions (method=calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, capturing the sustained higher-demand regime while the pipeline (1310) provides cover. This balances service (higher target from higher mean) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=981. Historical concluded lead times show variability with many 3-period observations since early periods; average observed lead time \u22482.15 \u2192 use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead times. Demand clearly shifted up at Period 19 (sustained high demand through Periods 19\u201328); use recent_N with N=10 (regime length ~Periods19\u201328) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases base-stock on the new high-demand regime and captures recent volatility. This balances higher service level (meeting elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline and uncertain arrivals.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Demand has shifted to a higher regime (confirmed Periods 19\u201325 avg \u2248297.7); recent demands (Periods 19\u201329) are consistently high. On-hand=0 but in-transit=923 (large pipeline); several past orders experienced variable lead times (evidence in concludes). I set L="calculate" to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the observed >2 mean rather than blindly trusting promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to target the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 19\u201325 length=7). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the base-stock and caps responsive to the confirmed high-demand regime while letting the backend's lead-time estimate reflect observed delivery variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=1258. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 2\u20133 periods but multiple concluded samples exist; use 'calculate' to average observed lead times. Demand increased at Period_19 and has stayed high through Period_30; use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 19\u201330) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the sustained higher regime. This raises base-stock to meet elevated demand while the OR cap limits extreme over-ordering given holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 32: recent demand regime is the higher regime (Periods 19\u201328 showed sustained high demand). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1258 \u2014 sizable pipeline but arrivals are not yet visible this period. Historical concluded lead times vary (mix of 1\u20133, average \u22482.14), so use backend 'calculate' to let it average observed lead times. For demand sizing use default (covers (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) so the OR engine applies the full-sample mean adjusted for chosen L; sigma use default to reflect full-sample volatility. This balances service level given high recent demand while relying on pipeline visibility to prevent over-ordering given holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

I set L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=14 to capture the high-demand regime from Periods 19\u201332 (14 periods) so mu_hat reflects the sustained higher mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=14 to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while L=calculate accounts for actual lead-time evidence and avoids under-ordering due to delayed/lost shipments.

On-hand=0, in-transit=1319 (covers multiple upcoming lead+review periods). Observed concluded lead times (14 samples) average \u22482.14 \u2192 use calculate so backend uses observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime from Period 19\u201333; use same recent_N (N=15) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices align mu_hat/sigma_hat to the current high-demand regime while L=calculate lets the backend account for the empirically observed lead-time (> promised) so ordering balances service level versus holding cost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=1368. Recent demand regime (confirmed Period 26) is high since Period 19; recent demands are much larger than early-sample history. Observed concluded lead times (14 observations) average \u22482.21, so I use a calculated L to reflect realized variability rather than the promised 2. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 19\u201334, regime length=16) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the high-demand samples. This preserves service by raising target base stock for the higher-demand regime while keeping sigma driven by recent volatility; using calculated L accounts for observed extra delay risk and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: on-hand=0, in-transit=1399. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 19 (periods 19\u201335 much larger than earlier samples) and multiple observed lead times (mix of 1\u20133, but prior analysis confirmed LT=3 earlier). To focus the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime, I set L using observed lead times (allowing backend to average actuals) and compute demand forecast and volatility from the recent high-demand regime. L: use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=17 (regime from Period 19\u201335; N=max(min(17,20),3)=17) so (1+L)\xd7mean of last 17 samples captures the new higher demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=17 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. This prioritizes service for the confirmed higher-demand period while letting OR backend compute safety stock given profit/holding costs and the inferred lead time.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37 decision. Recent demand is in a sustained high regime since Period_19 (weekly demands ~325\u2013591, recent samples 457,402,507,518,492,591,549). On-hand=0 but in-transit=1412 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show lead-times varying, but the last several concluded arrivals indicate a 2-period actual lead time. I set L via recent_N to capture the recent lead-time regime. For demand forecast I use recent_N to reflect the sustained high-demand regime (use last 7 demand samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with same N to capture recent volatility. These choices make mu_hat responsive to the higher-demand regime while L captures the shorter recent lead time; together they avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline and balance service level vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period25 conclude: P23\u2192P25 lead_time=2; Period28 conclude: P26\u2192P28 lead_time=2; Period29 conclude: P27\u2192P29 lead_time=2; Period36 conclude: P34\u2192P36 lead_time=2).

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: on-hand=0, in-transit=1607. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time \u22482 in the latest window but earlier long delays occurred; use overall observed lead-time average so backend incorporates all evidence. Demand shifted up at Period_19 and has stayed high through Period_37, so forecast from the recent high-demand regime (Periods 19\u201337). Use recent_N=19 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained elevated mean and volatility; this balances service (reduce stockouts given large in-transit) vs holding cost by relying on regime-specific estimates.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=1607. Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u22482 in late history, and demand has moved to a higher regime (Periods 32\u201338 demand: 507,518,492,591,549,576,614). To capture the sustained high demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 periods. Use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times from conclude messages (reflecting recent 2-period confirmations). This raises the (1+L)\xd7forecast and volatility to meet service while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering aggressiveness.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: On-hand=0, in-transit=1923. Recent demands show a sustained high-demand regime since ~Period_30 (Periods 30\u201339 demands: 457,402,507,518,492,591,549,576,614,648). Lead-time history contains many 2-period confirmations (most recently at Periods 25\u201337). I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures confirmed shift to ~2). For demand I use recent_N N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the clear, sustained high-demand regime across the last 10 periods; this focuses the base-stock on current elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline will cap ordering via the OR engine. These choices prioritize service during the high-demand regime while letting the backend cap new orders to avoid excessive holding given the large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1264.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: recent demand is in a sustained high regime since Period_19 (avg \u2248298 over P19\u2013P25 and much higher thereafter; latest demands P34\u2013P40 range 492\u2013649). On-hand=0, in-transit=1607 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary but recent confirms 2-period behavior. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to let backend reconcile variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current high-demand regime (use last 7 demand samples to scale (1+L) mean). For volatility I use recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent variability rather than long-ago low-demand periods. These choices bias orders to satisfy much higher recent demand while recognizing pipeline coverage and avoiding overstating variance from older data.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 42. On-hand=0, in-transit=2064. Recent history shows sustained high demand since Period 19 and an upward trend in the last ~20 periods (large demands P22\u2013P41, with sharp increases P30+). Lead-time observations are mixed but recent concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period and some 1-period realizations; I'll let backend compute the empirical average lead time from observed concludes. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent upward trend while giving the OR engine recent-context data, I use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect recent mean and volatility over the latest 20 demands. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand and large pipeline) against holding cost by using recent demand estimates rather than full-history averages.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 43. On-hand=0, in-transit=2064. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 19 (carry-over insight). Use calculated lead time from observed concludes to reflect recent confirmations of L=2, and use recent_N=20 for demand stats to capture the sustained high-demand regime (cap at 20). This ensures mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent high mean/variance so base-stock orders cover (1+L) periods of the current regime while the OR cap limits order size versus holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period_19 (elevated weekly demands). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=2064. Recent concluded lead-time evidence (carry-overs) confirms actual lead time \u22482; I'll use the promised/default lead time. To align the forecast with the sustained high-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data: use the most recent 20 periods to capture the post-Period_19 regime (N=20). This ensures the OR engine targets service for the current high-demand level while the default L=2 keeps orders timed to observed arrivals and avoids under-ordering given the large pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: recent demand has entered a high regime (Periods 38\u201344: 614,648,649,755,741,774,845). On-hand=0, in-transit=1607 which is insufficient vs. implied 3-period demand. No new sustained lead-time change since Period 37 (lead_time=2 confirmed). I set L=default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples). Sigma also uses recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the base-stock to cover the current high-demand regime while using observed recent variance for safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 start. Recent demand has been strongly increasing (Periods 30\u201345 mostly 400\u2013919 range) and on-hand = 0 while in-transit = 2276 (large pipeline from recent orders). Historical concluded lead-times have varied but prior carry-over confirmed lead_time=2 around Periods 25\u201336; no new sustained lead-time change is confirmed. To avoid overfitting noisy lead-time shifts and because promised lead time = 2, I use default (promised) L. Given high sustained demand, use default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set; the large in-transit volume will let the backend cap orders appropriately. This balances service (capture high demand) vs holding cost by relying on established stats and the backend caps.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: 47. Recent demand has shifted sharply upward since Period 30 (sustained high demand through Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=2276 (covers multiple periods). Recent lead-time evidence is mixed but latest confirmed pattern includes 2-period arrivals; promised lead time is 2. I set L to default (promised=2) to align with OR engine assumptions and because recent lead-time confirmations vary. For demand I detect a sustained regime change starting Period 30, so I use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 30\u201346) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher mean and volatility; this focuses the forecast on the current high-demand regime and avoids dilution by older low-demand data. These parameters will raise the base-stock to meet the much higher recent demand while capping orders via the OR engine to limit excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand increased from \u2248297.7 (Periods 19\u201325) to \u2248645.7 over Periods 30\u201346 (+~117%), sustained high demand

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=2276, profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical concluded lead-times show mixed behavior but multiple confirmed observations (periods up through 37) exist; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand shifted up at Period_30 and has remained high through Period_46; to capture the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent regime (Periods 30\u201346, length=18) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 18 samples. This increases target base-stock to satisfy the elevated demand while reflecting recent volatility; using calculated L (backend) plus recent demand avoids overreacting to isolated late/early arrivals and helps balance service level vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

No new confirmed, sustained lead-time change beyond previously recorded signals. I set L to default (promised=2) to align with backend assumptions. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=19 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (approximately Period_30\u2192Period_48) so the base-stock reflects the current elevated mean and volatility, balancing service level (reduce lost sales) against holding costs given sizable in-transit inventory.

Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20133 with average \u22482.05; occasional 3-period delays but overall mean near 2. To reflect observed lead-time variability I let backend compute an empirical average (calculate). Given sustained high demand and large pipeline, use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine aligns base stock with overall sample statistics while capping orders. This balances service level (capture high demand) vs holding cost since in-transit is already large.
