  Samples: [('Period_1', 103), ('Period_2', 81), ('Period_3', 107), ('Period_4', 127), ('Period_5', 160)]
  Mean: 115.6, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start with no on-hand or in-transit and no concluded arrivals. No evidence of lead-time or demand regime change. Use promised lead time and population demand stats (all 5 historical samples) so the OR backend sets base-stock against full-sample mean/variance. This balances service vs holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1 (q=4/5 -> backend computes safety factor).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2: on-hand=0, in-transit=165 (ordered P1, not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals beyond Period 1, so cannot infer actual lead time change. Use promised lead time default to avoid premature adjustments. Demand evidence is limited; no sustained regime shift detected. Use default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend uses full sample stats scaled by (1+L). This keeps service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff while accounting for pipeline inventory.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed two consecutive conclude messages showing arrived=0 for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132, but this is insufficient (needs 3+ periods) to confirm a lead-time change or lost shipments. Promised lead time (2) will be used. Demand history shows no confirmed regime shift; use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR backend aligned with contractual lead time while avoiding overreaction to limited missing-arrival signals; it balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=378, past three conclude messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (ordered 165,161,52) despite promised L=2. Demand history shows a recent upward shift (samples: 103,81,107,127,160) \u2014 last 3 periods (107,127,160) average is 131.33. To protect service given likely extended/failed shipments, I set lead time explicitly to 3 (conservative estimate > promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent higher-demand regime: mu_hat uses (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples which scales coverage for review+lead, and sigma_hat uses recent volatility from last 3 samples. These choices increase target base-stock to improve fill rates while acknowledging higher holding cost via using only the most recent regime for variance.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (165,161,52) have not arrived by Period_4 conclude\u2192 sustained missing shipments; probable actual lead time \u22653 or lost shipments (3 consecutive periods with no arrivals).

Daily Profit: $548.00, Daily Holding Cost: $80.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $468.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 start: on-hand=80, in-transit=257. History shows orders from P1-P3 delayed; Period_4 conclude revealed P1\u2192arrival in P4 (lead_time=3) and P3\u2192arrival in P4 (lead_time=1), while P2 order still overdue. Given mixed observed lead times, use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Demand samples (103,81,107,127,160) show no abrupt recent drop\u2014use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (capturing longer observed lead time) against holding cost and accounts for current sizable pipeline (in-transit=257).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order on Period 1 arrived on Period 4, lead_time=3)

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision with on-hand=0, in-transit=414. Historical demand samples: [103,81,107,127,160] (mean=115.6). Prior conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (order on P1 arrived P4, lead_time=3) and there were sustained missing/delayed arrivals early. To reflect confirmed lead-time I set L explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which increases the base-stock to cover the longer replenishment horizon and mitigate stockouts while letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (P1\u2192P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=495 (some arrivals have been delayed historically). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed slower lead time and avoid under-ordering. Demand has no sustained new regime but recent periods are variable; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 demands (Periods 2-6) so the base-stock covers (1+L) periods of near-term demand while limiting excess holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $384.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: on-hand=0, in-transit=407. History shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 (Period 1 order arrived in Period 4). Several earlier shipments were delayed/lost but lead time now evidenced at 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR engine sizes orders for the longer pipeline. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_of_all_samples using the full historical samples\u2014this is conservative given noisy demand and limited sustained regime shifts. Defaults let the OR balance service level vs holding cost using the confirmed longer lead time.

Daily Profit: $388.00, Daily Holding Cost: $68.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 9. Observed concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 3 in multiple events (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) with occasional 1-period fast arrivals; several earlier shipments were delayed/lost before confirmations. On-hand=68, in-transit=341. I set L explicit=3 to match confirmed sustained lead-time=3 (prevents under-ordering). For demand I use default mu_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) using L=3, which balances recent higher demand with full-sample stability. sigma_hat default lets backend scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices align pipeline coverage to a 4-period review+lead horizon and mitigate service failures from underestimated lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $578.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed history shows shipments consistently arriving with 3-period delays (e.g., Period1 order arrived in Period4), on-hand=18, in-transit=333. Therefore set lead time explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples \u2014 this leverages full history while accounting for the longer lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: recent demand has risen (Periods 6-10 demands = 143,122,97,149,182; mean=138.6) and prior concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 (orders placed in P1 arrived in P4; sustained 3-period arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=492 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are delayed by L=3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (captures the most recent regime mean/volatility). This biases base-stock toward meeting elevated recent demand while letting OR backend cap orders to limit excess holding given holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=608. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time = 3 (e.g., Period1 order arrived in Period4; Period5 arrival pattern consistent). Several earlier shipments were delayed/lost relative to promised L=2, so I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat leverages full-sample estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap; this balances higher required pipeline (due to longer lead time) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=73, in-transit=358. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (e.g., P1\u2192arrived P4). Use explicit L=3 to reflect realized lead time and avoid underordering. Demand recently elevated; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime (recent demands: P8=97, P9=149, P10=182, P11=145, P12=177). This keeps the backend's (1+L)-period forecast and volatility focused on the current higher-demand regime, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding excess inventory given confirmed longer lead time.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=564. Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (sustained across several orders). To respect observed lead time and ensure pipeline covers the longer delay, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided samples; this yields a conservative base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the longer lead time and current in-transit inventory.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=455. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (orders on P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14), indicating actual lead time = 3 is sustained. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead-time so the OR engine sizes pipeline correctly over the (1+L) review+lead window. Demand samples (provided) have mean=115.6; using mu_hat default lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean = 4\xd7mean to cover four-period demand. sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to scale volatility for 4-period aggregation. This balances service (capture longer lead time) vs. holding cost by aligning forecast horizon with observed lead time and letting backend compute safety stock per profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: recent demand has stepped up (Periods 10-15 demands: 182,145,177,177,216,187) vs earlier lower values. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=597 (covers upcoming demand if shipments arrive). Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead_time=3 (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14), so set L to be calculated from observed lead times. To react to the higher recent demand regime, use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (Periods 10-15) so the OR backend stocks for the elevated demand while accounting for observed longer lead-times and pipeline. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by relying on recent demand and empirical lead-time estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $824.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: recent concluded history shows frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=3) though some 1-2 period arrivals exist. On-hand=0, in-transit=494 (pipeline large); several past shipments were delayed but lead-time=3 has been repeatedly observed. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period pattern while accounting for shorter arrivals). Demand estimates use defaults (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the provided samples are applied\u2014conservative choice given no sustained demand regime change beyond initial samples. This balances service (higher L increases required pipeline cover) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and capped order amount using observed lead-time average and historical demand stats.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed deliveries show sustained delays with multiple orders arriving 3 periods after ordering (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16). On-hand=0, in-transit=471. I set lead time explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I use default demand sizing (mu_hat default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of historical samples, and sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this leverages all provided samples while matching the longer lead time to cover the extra demand during transit and avoid stockouts given observed 3-period arrivals.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_19. History shows consistent 3-period arrivals (many concluded orders with lead_time=3) and repeated demand uplift in recent periods (Periods 14-18: 216,187,217,198,245). I therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual LT and avoid underordering. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands. Volatility also uses recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices balance service (capture elevated demand and longer LT) against holding cost by relying on recent regime evidence rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=888. Recent demand has jumped sharply (Periods 17-19: 198,245,301). Historical arrivals show actual lead time \u22483 periods (confirmed in history). To protect service with observed longer lead time and respond to the new high-demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine orders for (1+L) review+lead demand and reflects recent volatility. This balances higher service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost by basing safety stock on the recent elevated demand.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time \u22483 (multiple orders with lead_time=3). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering given delayed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 17-20) to capture the new high-demand regime when forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR base-stock targets the higher mean and measured volatility, balancing service level against holding cost while using pipeline coverage to avoid stockouts from the prolonged lead time.

Period 22. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 17 (periods 17-21: 245,301,296,307 \u2014 sustained rise). On-hand=0, in-transit=1122 (large pipeline). Observed lead times vary but average >2 (evidence in conclude messages shows many 3-period arrivals). To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime, set L via calculate (use average of observed lead times). For demand forecast, use recent_N with N=5 to target the new regime (Periods 17-21) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This limits overstock risk because large in-transit plus higher mu_hat prevents underordering while recent_N sigma keeps safety buffer tied to current volatility.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=1122. Historical concludes show a sustained shift to higher demand starting Period 17 (198,245,301,296,307,283) and many observed lead_times = 3 (dominant). Set L via calculate to use the average of observed lead times (captures frequent 3-period realizations). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (the detected regime Periods 17-22, N = 6) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 6 demands, capturing the higher demand regime and covering review+lead demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=6 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices bias the base stock upward to avoid stockouts under the confirmed higher-demand regime while reflecting observed lead-time behavior; using recent samples prevents dilution by earlier lower-demand periods.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times are predominantly 3 periods (multiple confirmations across history). I set L using calculate to let backend use average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT\u22483). For demand, I use recent_N with N=7 to base mu_hat on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 17-23). For volatility I use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent higher variance. These choices prioritize meeting much higher current demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits extra ordering; using recent data reduces stockouts at cost of higher holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period_25: demand has been in a higher regime since Period_17 (sustained elevated weekly demand ~245-342). On-hand=0, in-transit=1124 (large pipeline covering multiple review+lead periods). Observed concluded lead times show frequent 3-period arrivals and some 1-2s; average of observed lead times is >2, so use calculated average lead time. For demand forecasting use recent data from the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 17-24, length=8) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 to reflect the new mean and volatility. These choices keep the base-stock aligned with the current high-demand regime while accounting for longer observed lead times and sizable pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=0, in-transit=1133. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time repeatedly = 3 (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3), and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period_17 (Periods 17\u201325 avg \u2248291.8 vs earlier ~147.6). To reflect confirmed longer actual lead time I select L by 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to base mu_hat on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 17\u201325) so the base-stock covers (1+L) periods of the higher mean demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=9 to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices prioritize service during the sustained higher demand while acknowledging delayed arrivals; they help the OR engine size orders to reduce stockouts given the longer inferred lead time while controlling holding cost by using regime-specific demand statistics.

I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=3).

For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=10 to capture current volatility. These choices align base-stock with the new higher demand while using observed lead-time behavior to avoid underordering despite prior lost/delayed shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Current period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=1201. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (orders repeatedly arriving after 3). Demand regime shifted starting Period 17 (sustained high demand through Period 27). Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-change high-demand regime (Periods 17\u201327 length=11), so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the recent regime and balances higher service level against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_29: demand has been in the higher regime since Period_17 (sustained ~248 avg vs ~147 prior). On-hand=0, in-transit=1298 (sufficient pipeline but some variability in arrival lead times historically). Observed lead-times vary (mix of 3,2,1) but recent pattern is mixed\u2014use a short recent average to capture current effective lead time variability. Set L using recent_N to reflect recent observed lead times. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 17\u201328, length 12) so the OR backend stocks for the elevated demand level and its volatility, balancing high profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=1260, recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period_17 (sustained high demands: Periods 17-29). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) with multiple confirmations of 3-period arrivals; to capture actual behavior I let backend compute average observed lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate focused on the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 17\u201329, length=13) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher mean and volatility. This balances service (reduce stockouts given large in-transit and high demand) versus holding cost by relying on recent regime stats rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=1154; recent demand has been well above earlier periods (Periods 24-30 demands = 308,346,372,394,380,374,450; recent mean ~378). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time \u22483 (multiple orders with lead_time=3). To protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while acknowledging long lead time and large pipeline, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead demand forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (captures current mean and volatility over the last 7 periods). This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher demand while the OR backend will cap order size; using recent statistics reduces understock risk given observed lead-time=3 and the large in-transit volume helps avoid over-ordering immediately.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: recent demand has been in the elevated regime confirmed at Period_20 (P17\u2013P31 high). On-hand=0, in-transit=1573 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times average ~2.2 periods (multiple 2s and 3s; evidence in conclude history), so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. To capture the post-changepoint demand level I use recent_N (N=15, Periods 17\u201331) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock covers the elevated mean and volatility rather than the earlier low-demand data. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=1154. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed lead_times = [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3,1,3,2,2,2,1], avg=2.125) and a sustained demand regime shift around Period 17 (higher mean since P17). Given sustained mixed lead-time evidence, I set L to the calculated average to reflect actual variability. For demand, I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to capture full-sample demand including the confirmed higher-regime periods. sigma_hat uses default to reflect full-sample volatility. These choices let the OR backend raise the base-stock to cover the longer effective lead time while accounting for the higher recent demand and observed variability, balancing service level vs holding cost in presence of past delayed shipments.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=1154. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 17 (sustained large demands through Period 33). Lead-time history is mixed (observed 1\u20133); use computed average to let backend infer current effective L from observations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean and volatility (N chosen to cover the recent regime length). This ensures orders target the elevated demand while honoring observed lead-time variability and limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_35: on-hand=0, in-transit=1468. Recent demand has been in a higher regime (Periods 30-34: 450,444,528,534,543). Lead-time history shows mixed 1\u20133 but overall variability; let backend compute average observed lead time. To capture the sustained high-demand regime, set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 periods (captures current elevated mean/variance) so the OR engine raises base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36: on-hand=0, in-transit=1910. Historical conclues show actual lead times frequently =3 (with some 1-2), and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (higher demand from P17 onward). To capture persistent longer lead-time behavior I let L be inferred from observed conclues (calculate). For demand I target the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N for mu_hat based on the most recent regime (Periods 17\u201335, regime length=19) so the OR backend forecasts using recent high demand. Use the same recent_N window for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine account for lead-time via observed avg: they reduce stockouts given large in-transit and higher demand but avoid excessive inventory beyond the recent-demand-driven base stock.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37: recent demand has been in the higher regime confirmed at Period_17 (sustained ~+68%). On-hand=0, in-transit=1596 (some in-transit have variable/long lead times historically). Recent observed lead times (concluded arrivals) show mostly 2s with occasional 1s and 3s. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=4, holding=1 (q=0.8 \u2192 high service target) I set L to average of the most recent 5 observed lead times to reflect the recent shift toward 2-period deliveries while still allowing occasional 1/3-day outcomes. For demand I use a recent-N estimate over the last 20 periods (regime since Period_17 length=20) so mu_hat reflects the new higher mean across the review+lead horizon. Sigma_hat uses the same recent_N window (N=20) to capture current volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering for presumed longer delays.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Demand shifted up at Period_17 and the recent high-demand regime runs through Period_37 (\u224821 periods); to capture current elevated mean/volatility I use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (use the last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (capture higher recent demand) while relying on the backend cap to limit single-period overorders given large pipeline.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 39: on-hand=0, in-transit=1658. Historical concludes show actual lead times varying (1\u20133); recent concludes (Periods 28\u201337) are dominated by 2-period arrivals, so I estimate lead time from recent observations. Demand underwent a sustained regime shift at Period 17 to much higher levels; recent demand remains elevated. To capture the higher demand and its volatility, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with a long window (20) to reflect the post-shift regime. L uses recent_N over the most recent 6 observed lead times to reflect the recent mix (mostly 2s). These choices give the OR backend a demand forecast aligned with the sustained higher-demand regime while using a recent empirical lead time to mitigate lost/delayed-shipment risk and avoid overstocking.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2016.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: recent demand is much higher (periods 30-39 show large volumes, e.g., 444\u2013679) and pipeline is large (on-hand=0, in-transit=1154) with a history of variable actual lead times (observed 1\u20133). Many concluded arrivals show lead_time variability and occasional delayed/lost shipments. I choose L=calculate to let backend infer the average observed lead time from concluded history (captures variable/shifted lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 5 demand samples (captures the new high-demand regime while limiting noise). For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while letting the backend account for pipeline; using recent samples reduces understock risk during the sustained high-demand regime and the calculated lead time helps mitigate late-arrival risk given past variability.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: demand has been at the higher regime since Period_17 (sustained +68%). On-hand=0, in-transit=1863 which should cover multiple periods of elevated demand but some past shipments exhibited variable lead times (1-3). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-Period_17 high-demand regime (use the most recent 20 samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the recent high-demand regime. These choices prioritize meeting higher recent demand while using the observed lead-time average to avoid under-ordering given past delayed shipments.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_42. On-hand=0, in-transit=1880. Historical concluded lead-times show mixed but multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals early and later variability; use calculate so backend averages observed lead times. Demand has a sustained high regime since Period_17 (demands ~248\u2192700s); to capture recent high-volume behavior I select recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent sustained regime). Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) aligns volatility estimate with recent high-demand periods. These choices help the OR engine set a base-stock appropriate for the new high-demand regime while letting the backend account for averaged lead-time risk; keeping carry-over notes conservative given existing recorded insights.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=1961. Historical concludes show persistent actual lead times around 1\u20133 with many 2\u20133 observations; demand has been in a higher regime since Period_17 (sustained). To ensure the OR backend plans for recent high demand and handle lead-time variability, I set L by averaging recent observed lead times and base demand on the last 20 periods (captures the post-changepoint high-demand regime). Using recent_N for sigma aligns volatility with recent behavior. These choices prioritize meeting service (profit $4 vs hold $1) under elevated demand while limiting excess holding by focusing on recent data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2836.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent demand has shifted markedly higher since Period_31 (sustained). On-hand=0, in-transit=1252 (some arrivals likely pending). Historical concluded lead times show multiple 2\u20133 period deliveries (recent confirms many 3s). To reflect the new high-demand regime I use recent demand windows for mu/sigma and a recent-average lead time estimate. L: use recent_N to capture the currently observed 2\u20133 period pattern. mu_hat: use recent_N over the strong-growth regime (Periods 31\u201343) so the base-stock targets the new higher demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N over the same recent window to reflect elevated volatility. These choices push the OR engine to raise base stock to meet much larger recent demand while keeping variability estimates aligned with the same period. They also acknowledge in-transit is insufficient vs. (1+L)*recent mean so OR will order up to the capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: avg increased from 328.3 (Periods 17-30) to 616.5 (Periods 31-43), +88%

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: recent demand is high (regime since Period_31; recent demands >> early periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=1855 (sizable pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals in recent periods show actual lead time \u22483 (orders from P40\u2192P43, P41\u2192P44). I therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate capturing the post-change regime (use last 14 concluded-period samples from Period_31\u2013Period_44) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of recent high-demand periods. I match sigma_hat to the same recent window (recent_N N=14) to capture current volatility. These choices align ordering with the sustained higher demand and the observed longer actual lead time while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=2607. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals recently (P40\u2192P43, P41\u2192P44, P42\u2192P45) \u2014 actual lead time effectively 3. Demand has been in a higher regime since ~P31 (sustained elevated demand). To ensure pipeline covers the (L+1) review+lead window under the high-demand regime, I set L explicit=3 and use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecasts on the most recent high-demand periods (captures recent mean/volatility while avoiding older low-demand data). This balances the higher service level needed (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding costs by sizing base-stock to recent demand and recent variability and by explicitly accounting for the longer observed lead time. Missing/lost shipments are already reflected in concluded history and accounted for by using L=3 and recent data.

Lead times have varied (observed 1\u20133) with multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals earlier; use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 31\u201346, length 16) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and volatility and avoid dilution by earlier low-demand data.

Use L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20133 signals). Demand has multiple sustained regime shifts in history; no new confirmed demand shift in last few periods beyond existing records, so use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" to base forecast on full sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to balance service level vs holding cost given high in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=2841. Historical concludes show frequent actual lead times of 1\u20133 with multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals recently; demand has been in the higher regime since Period_31 (avg ~616.5). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures variable 1\u20133 behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 to anchor mu_hat to the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 31\u201348) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects current elevated demand; sigma_hat recent_N N=18 captures volatility in the same window. This balances high service level (profit $4 vs hold $1 \u2192 high critical fractile) against holding cost by using recent high-demand estimates and an empirically derived lead time to avoid under-ordering given large in-transit and long/variable lead times.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_50: demand has been in a high regime for many periods (recent demands ~907,968,957,1043,1097). Historical concludes show frequent 3-period lead times (many orders with lead_time=3). On-hand is 0 and large pipeline=2841. I set L to recent_N to reflect the empirically observed lead-time behavior. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (most recent 5 demand samples) to capture the recent high-demand regime; (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std will let the OR backend size base stock to cover the review+lead period while sigma_hat from recent volatility ensures safety stock matches current variability. This balances higher service requirement under elevated demand against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.
