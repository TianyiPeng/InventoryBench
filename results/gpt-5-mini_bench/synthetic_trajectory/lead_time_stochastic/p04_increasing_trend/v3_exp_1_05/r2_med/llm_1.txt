{
  "rationale": "World/product: chips(Regular) is commodity snack with no calendar cues provided. Demand regime: recent demand has been accelerating; Periods 44\u201349 show very high weekly demand (P44=873, P45=907, P46=968, P47=957, P48=1043, P49=1097) \u2014 expect next-period demand \u22481,000\u20131,150. Lead time / arrivals: historical actual lead times vary 1\u20133 periods; some shipments have arrived with 3-period delays, so assume worst-case actual lead_time\u22483 for planning. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=3800 units. Coverage check: with expected demand \u22481,050 per period, in-transit 3800 covers ~3.6 periods. Using the decision-time rule (cover L+1 periods where L\u22652) and conservatively treating L\u22483, in-transit is sufficient to cover the next 3\u20134 periods. Holding cost vs profit: holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit favors avoiding excessive early receipts. Final order logic: place no order this period to avoid excess holding cost since in-transit inventory already covers required near-term demand even under longer lead time.",
