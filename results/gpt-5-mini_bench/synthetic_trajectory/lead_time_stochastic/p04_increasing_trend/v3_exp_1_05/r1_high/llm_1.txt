On-hand=0, in-transit=4000 units \u2014 sufficient to cover next several periods even if lead time varies (observed 1\u20133). Supplier lead time remains variable (evidence in history), but most large shipments eventually arrive. Holding cost ($1) is small vs profit ($19), yet given large in-transit pipeline ordering more now risks unnecessary holding if all in-transit arrive. Forecast next-period demand ~1,150\u20131,200; in-transit 4,000 covers this. No new sustained regime or lead-time signal beyond existing records. Decision: place no additional order this period and rely on in-transit supply; monitor arrivals to update lead-time/pipeline estimation.",
