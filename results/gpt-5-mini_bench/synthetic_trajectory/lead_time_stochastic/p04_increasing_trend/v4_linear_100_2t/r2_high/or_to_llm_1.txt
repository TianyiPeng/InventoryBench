Decision logic: large pipeline suggests we already have substantial coverage if those units arrive; but their continued absence so far raises risk that some or all may be lost/delayed. Holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1) so understocking is more costly than modest overstock. However, blindly following OR's 86 would materially raise holding risk if in-transit eventually arrives. Compromise: place a modest replenishment to cover potential shortfalls while not over-committing \u2014 order = 39 units (rounded from order_raw). This keeps pipeline + new order \u2248 387 which matches the base-stock target and limits additional exposure if in-transit arrives.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 (carry-over insight). With L=3 I must cover current + L future demand (4 periods) when ordering. Inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=803 (undelivered units). Demand outlook: recent periods show large but irregular spikes (e.g., 298 at P48, 0 at P49) and no sustained upward regime; OR recommended 0 using promised L and historical demand. Decision: do not order this period. Reason: the in-transit pipeline (803 units) already provides substantial coverage for the next 4 periods\u2014likely exceeding expected 4-period demand even in high-spike scenarios\u2014while placing more units increases holding cost ($1/unit/period) with no clear sustained demand increase. I follow OR's conservative recommendation of 0 given strong pipeline coverage and confirmed longer lead time which increases risk of double-stocking if additional orders later also arrive. If future conclude messages show pipeline shortfalls or sustained demand rise, I'll place orders then.",
