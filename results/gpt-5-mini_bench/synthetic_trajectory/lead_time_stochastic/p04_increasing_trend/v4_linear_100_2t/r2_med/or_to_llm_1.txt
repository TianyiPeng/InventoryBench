Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "State inference: Actual lead time has been previously confirmed as 3 periods (recorded in carry-over). Current observable pipeline = 800 units, on-hand = 0. Demand evidence: recent single-period spikes (e.g., 509 at P31, 326 at P38, 298 at P48) show potential for large single-period demand, but these are intermittent. Requirement: ensure order + on-hand + in-transit covers (L+1) periods of demand; using confirmed L=3 \u2192 cover 4 periods. Even if we conservatively assume 4-period demand = 4 \xd7 300 = 1,200 (300 is a high-but-plausible peak), the pipeline of 800 is short of that extreme, but typical recent rolling demands are much lower and 800 covers multiple normal periods (e.g., 4 \xd7 200 = 800). Ordering now would not arrive until at least 3 periods later and would further increase holding cost ($1/unit/period). OR recommended 0 which caps ordering given its historical calculation; given large in-transit volume, uncertain/variable lead times, and high holding cost, placing additional order risks negative contribution due to holding cost before sales. Decision: place 0 orders. This avoids increasing holding cost while relying on substantial pipeline; monitor arrivals in subsequent concluded periods and only order when pipeline + on-hand clearly insufficient for upcoming 4-period demand horizon.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR (0 units): on-hand 0 but large in-transit = 800 units and confirmed lead time=3 \u2192 avoid extra ordering to prevent unnecessary holding cost; monitor arrivals and re-evaluate if pipeline depletes.",
