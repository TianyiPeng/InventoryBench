Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start; no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals. Historical demand samples: [75,90,0,170,127] (mean=92.4). Promised lead time=2. No evidence yet of lead-time or demand regime changes. Use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples to set the base-stock while capping orders. This balances service level given uncertain demand with holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=197 (ordered P1, arrived=0) \u2014 this single missed arrival could be normal given promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet to confirm a lead-time shift. Use promised lead time (default) and demand estimates based on all historical samples to avoid overreacting to one missed arrival. mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level versus holding cost given current uncertainty.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=354 (197+157 outstanding). No concluded arrivals yet (orders placed P1/P2 not confirmed), so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised 2. Demand history is limited and shows no sustained regime shift. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This preserves pipeline coverage for the review+lead period and avoids overfitting to only two recent observations while arrivals are still in-flight.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period_4. On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (orders from P1-P3). Orders placed in P1 (197), P2 (157), P3 (4) have not concluded by their expected arrivals, indicating lead time is longer than promised 2 or shipments delayed/lost. To protect service, set L explicit=3 to reflect longer observed lead time. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) given extended lead time, and sigma_hat default to scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). This increases target pipeline to cover extra periods while keeping standard volatility sizing.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >2: orders placed P1(197), P2(157), P3(4) remain in-transit with total 358 units and no arrivals by Period_3 conclude.

Daily Profit: $348.00, Daily Holding Cost: $114.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $234.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=114, in-transit=301 with prior delayed arrivals. Period_4 conclude shows P1 order arrived in P4 => lead time observed = 3 periods (most recent signal). Several earlier orders remained in-transit past promised lead time, so I bias lead-time estimate to the most recent confirmed value to avoid under-ordering. Set L using recent_N (N=1) to reflect the latest observed lead time=3. Use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, ensuring the base-stock covers (L+1) periods of demand and balances service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: recent concluded history shows an actual long lead time signal \u2014 Period_4 conclude reported P1 order arrived in P4 (lead_time=3). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=376 (several overdue arrivals earlier; pipeline exists but arrival timing has stretched). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time so the OR backend plans across the correct replenishment horizon. I keep mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so demand forecast uses all available samples (stable recent demand mean/variance from history) scaled by (1+L). This balances service (accounting for longer lead time) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=494. Recent concluded demands (Periods 4-6) = [87, 122, 127], showing a higher recent average than earlier volatile periods (Period_3 spike 164 then drop). Several past shipments were delayed and one confirmed lead_time=3 (P1\u2192P4); outstanding pipeline suggests actual lead time >=3. To protect service while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set L explicitly to 3. I forecast demand using the most recent stable regime (last N=3 periods) so mu_hat uses recent_N N=3 (captures current average demand ~112) across the review+lead window (1+L periods). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=3 to reflect current variability and keep safety stock responsive to recent demand rather than older volatile samples. This balances higher service need (due to long/in-transit pipeline) against holding cost pressure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $251.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=65, in-transit=350. History shows actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (P1 order arrived in P4). Several earlier orders were delayed/lost but lead time now has evidence=3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed deliveries so the OR engine will plan across the correct pipeline length. Demand history is limited and shows no sustained 3+ period regime shift, so I use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat while accounting for the longer lead time. This balances higher service level (longer coverage) against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Daily Profit: $440.00, Daily Holding Cost: $30.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $410.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=30, in-transit=348. Historical demand samples (Periods1-5): [75,90,0,170,127]; recent realized arrivals confirm prolonged lead time. Several orders that were expected by promised L=2 arrived after 3 periods. I therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the replenishment target on the latest 5-demand samples across the review+lead period, and keep sigma_hat as default (uses all-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These choices ensure the OR backend targets a higher base-stock to cover the longer confirmed lead time while using recent demand evidence to avoid overstock from older outliers.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: Period1 order arrived in Period4; Period4 order arrived in Period7; Period5 order arrived in Period8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $317.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: recent observed demand (P5-P9 = 122,127,79,110,84) averages ~104.4 units/period. History shows confirmed lead time = 3 (arrivals: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). Current inventory: on-hand=19, in-transit=391, so pipeline is large and should cover the 4-period review+lead window. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time (avoids underordering if promised L=2). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast/uncertainty on the most recent regime (captures the post-arrival demand pattern), producing (1+L)-scaled demand and volatility appropriate for a 4-period coverage while letting the OR backend compute exact base_stock and caps.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (several P1/P4/P5\u2192arrivals). Recent demand (Periods 6-10 = 127,79,110,84,104) has mean 100.8. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid under-ordering given overdue shipments. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent to capture the current regime (4\xd7100.8 \u2248 403.2 forecast across review+lead). Volatility likewise uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability for safety stock sizing. These parameters prioritize service (profit $4) while limiting holding cost ($1) given long lead time and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=437. Historical conclues show consistent 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) so treat actual lead time as 3. Use L explicit=3 to ensure pipeline coverage (orders placed now must cover 4 periods of demand). Recent demand (Periods4\u201311 = 87,122,127,79,110,84,104,120) shows a sustained higher regime vs initial 5-sample series; I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the current regime, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given long lead time) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $314.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent demand has been elevated (~80\u2013127 per period) versus the seed samples. On-hand=66, in-transit=288 (multiple past orders outstanding); historical concluded arrivals show variable but multi-period delays (observed lead times include several 3-period realizations). I therefore let the backend compute an updated lead time estimate from observed lead times (method=calculate) and use default demand aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all sample history scaled for (1+L). This balances service (captures longer empirical lead time) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base_stock and cap with full-sample mean/variance while using the empirical lead-time estimate.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_14. On-hand=0, in-transit=375. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple arrivals: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). Many earlier promised 2-period shipments have been delayed to 3, and several orders remain in-transit. To insure service while accounting for observed longer lead time, I set L explicitly to 3. Demand shows no sustained recent regime shift (mixed highs/lows across periods 1\u201313), so I use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all historical samples scaled by (1+L). This balances higher pipeline coverage for the longer confirmed lead time while avoiding overreaction to short-term demand variability.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=468. Historical conclude messages show a persistent lead-time of 3 periods (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3). To cover the longer confirmed lead time and recent demand, I set L explicitly to 3. Demand looks lower-moderate recently; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures Periods 10\u201314 demands) so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, providing coverage for the 4-period review+lead window while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit delays) against holding cost by using recent demand rather than all-time history.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=456. Historical concludes strongly confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). Recent demand (Periods 11-15 = 120,95,75,46,135) shows mean ~94.2. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead-time (avoids underordering given delayed arrivals). For demand forecast I use recent_N N=5 so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 periods (captures current regime). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while acknowledging long lead times and high in-transit volume.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders observed arriving after 3 periods). Several earlier promised arrivals were delayed; treat lead time as 3 to avoid underordering. Set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, giving a conservative base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the confirmed longer lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=393; recent demand has stepped up (Periods 13-17 demands: 75,46,135,183,212). Multiple concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (recent: P14->P17). To cover the review+lead horizon and the recent higher demand regime, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures the recent surge). This also compensates for prior lost/delayed shipments by targeting a higher base stock over a 4-period horizon.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_19. On-hand=0, in-transit=639. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent lead-time of 3 periods (multiple orders observed with W=3). Demand has shifted higher starting around Period_12 (recent demands: P12-P18 = 95,75,46,135,183,212,220), so I treat the recent high-demand regime as relevant. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR backend forecasts over the correct replenishment horizon. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 (covering Periods 12\u201318) to capture the new higher mean and volatility; this focuses the base-stock and cap calculations on the current regime and balances service level vs holding cost given the long lead time and large in-transit position.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: P1 order arrived P4; P4 order arrived P7; P5 order arrived P8; additional consistent W=3 observations through Period_17).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: recent demand has shifted to a higher regime (many periods with 95\u2013220 units demand since Period_12). On-hand=0, in-transit=669 (large pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid under-ordering from assuming promised 2. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (captures the high-demand regime from Period_12\u2192Period_19) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean over the review+lead window. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while recognizing the large in-transit pipeline to avoid excessive holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: recent demand has risen sharply (last 5 periods demands = 183,212,220,166,150; avg=186.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=675 (large but may be slightly below what 4-period coverage of recent demand implies). Multiple concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 3; using that explicit L avoids under-ordering due to promised=2. I set L=explicit(3). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (covers P16\u2013P20). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 so the OR engine sizes safety stock to recent variability. These choices bias orders upward to protect service level given sustained higher demand and confirmed longer lead time while letting the OR backend trade off profit vs holding cost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. On-hand=0, in-transit=795 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=3 periods over many observations; use observed-average lead time. Demand history is volatile with recent high-demand episodes; I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize latest regime while letting backend scale by (1+L). This keeps target base-stock responsive to recent demand surges while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding given high in-transit inventory.

With L=3 I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this leverages full sample history while the backend's capped ordering will moderate order size given high in-transit inventory. This balances service (accounting for confirmed 3-period lead time) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_24: recent demand has been elevated and variable (Periods19-23 demands = 166,150,100,158,80; recent mean \u2248130.8). Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple confirmations through Period_19 and arrivals in Periods 4,7,8,12,15,16,17,23). On-hand=46, in-transit=669 -> significant pipeline but lead time is longer than promised, so use explicit L=3. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current higher-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets service for a 4-period coverage (review+lead) based on the current elevated mean while using recent volatility and confirmed lead time to avoid stockouts despite delayed shipments.

I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, ensuring base-stock covers (L+1) periods of expected demand while the backend's cap limits extreme ordering given holding cost (Profit=$4, Holding=$1). This balances service level against holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and large in-transit volume.

Pipeline of 669 likely arriving over future periods but arrivals are observed with a 1-period reporting delay. Profit=4, holding=1 so service level should be prioritized but avoid excess holding. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Demand has shifted up in recent periods (Periods 21-25 demands = 100,158,80,271,182) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher mean and volatility over the review+lead horizon (1+L periods) and to make the OR engine target an appropriate base-stock for the current regime. This balances higher service needs (due to high recent demand) against holding cost and accounts for the longer confirmed lead time and outstanding in-transit units.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: recent demand is volatile with several large spikes (Periods 24\u201325 were 271 and 182). On-hand=0, in-transit=760 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 periods. I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to match observed arrivals. For demand I use a recent_N (N=5) estimate to capture the latest regime (Periods 22\u201326 demands: 158, 80, 271, 182, 60) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(recent5) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(recent5). This keeps orders responsive to the current high/variable demand while the explicit L aligns ordering timing to observed 3-period arrivals and avoids over-ordering given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: demand context shows high, volatile demand historically with recent large spikes (periods 16-27 had many high-demand periods). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=760 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages consistently show lead time = 3 (multiple confirmed arrivals at W=3). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the sustained actual lead time. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples so the base-stock balances service level vs holding cost given the longer lead time and the existing large in-transit pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: historical small sample demand (75,90,0,170,127) with recent large volatility; profit=4, holding=1 so target service level moderate. On-hand=0, in-transit=669 (multiple past shipments confirm actual lead time=3). Many past orders arrive with W=3 repeatedly, so set lead time to 3 to align pipeline forecasting. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures full review+lead demand given L=3). Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, reflecting observed high variability. This balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and large in-transit volume.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_30. On-hand=0, in-transit=669. Historical concluded arrivals show majority lead_time=3 but occasional 2 (and rare 1); use backend-calculated average lead time to capture mixed observations. Demand has been volatile recently with several large spikes in the last 5 periods (Periods 25-29 demands: 182, 60, 239, 225, 69) \u2014 I treat the most recent 5 samples as the relevant regime for forecasting. Therefore set L using 'calculate' (avg observed lead times), mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus forecast on latest demand regime across review+lead period, and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices help the OR backend target service level responsive to recent demand while letting L reflect actual observed lead-time mix so pipeline coverage (1+L) is appropriate given many late arrivals.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=721 (large pipeline arriving under L=3). I set L explicit=3 to match observed deliveries so the OR engine plans for the correct pipeline horizon. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples, leveraging full history while the explicit L corrects for lead-time mismatch; this balances service (using observed longer lead time) vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 32: recent demand has been volatile but generally high (recent demands: P27-31 = 239,91,225,110,225 with several large spikes). On-hand=0, in-transit=721 \u2014 large pipeline exists but many past shipments showed lead_time=3; use the observed lead-time history rather than the promised 2. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to capture the confirmed multi-period (\u22483) reality. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) so the base-stock reflects current high/volatile demand while avoiding overweighting distant history. This balances higher service level against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=779. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, etc.). Demand samples (Periods 1-5 shown earlier and continuing history) are volatile with several stockouts; large in-transit pipeline likely reflects delayed shipments arriving with W=3. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (captures confirmed W=3). I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (accounts for longer lead time) against holding cost given the large in-transit volume and demand variability.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=721. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=3 in many periods (evidence across Periods 4,7,8,12,15,16,17,23, etc.), so I let L be calculated from observed lead times to reflect this. No sustained (3+ period) demand regime change detected despite a single large spike at Period_33, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample estimates scaled by (1+L)). These settings bias the OR engine toward covering the longer observed pipeline and avoid overreacting to a one-off demand spike while balancing service level vs holding cost.

I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time data (captures confirmed W=3 behavior). Demand history sample mean is from the provided five samples; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this balances service level given high in-transit inventory while letting the OR engine size orders using observed lead-time-adjusted demand uncertainty.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=721. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed observations). Recent demand has shifted higher and is very volatile (last five demands: P31-35 = 225,119,399,87,688). To protect service with observed L=3 and capture recent regime, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the last 5 samples. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock inputs with the confirmed longer lead time and recent high/volatile demand while avoiding dilution by older data.

Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and ensure pipeline coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=414, in-transit=721. Historical conclude messages show a persistent lead-time of 3 periods (multiple confirmed P\u2192P+3 arrivals across history) and occasional 1\u20132 period anomalies. Several earlier long delays and consistent P\u2192P+3 arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P36\u2192P37) justify treating actual L=3 rather than promised 2. I set L explicitly to 3 to ensure pipeline coverage matches observed arrivals. For demand forecasting I use the backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (this keeps the forecast anchored to full historical demand while the corrected L covers delayed arrivals). This balances service (higher lead-time coverage) against holding cost given current large on-hand + in-transit position.

Daily Reward (R_t): $461.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: recent history shows actual lead time consistently \u22483 periods (multiple concluded orders P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=239, in-transit=721. With confirmed longer lead time, I let the OR engine infer L from observed lead-times (calculate) so it uses realized W\u22483. I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set\u2014this leverages all data given the high volatility and avoids overfitting to short recent spikes. This balances service (capture longer lead time) vs holding cost by relying on observed lead-time-adjusted demand aggregation rather than aggressive explicit forecasts. No new missing-shipment signal to record.

Daily Reward (R_t): $211.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. Recent demand has been variable with several large spikes (e.g., Periods 33,35,36) but last observed demands: P38=192, P39=104, P40=175, P41=90. Current inventory: on-hand=149, in-transit=721 \u2014 pipeline is very large relative to expected demand. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, etc.). To avoid over-ordering given the huge pipeline, set L explicitly to 3 (actual observed). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages all data while letting caps constrain order size given the large in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent demand (Periods 38-42 = 192,104,175,90,66) averages ~125 over last 5 periods. On-hand=83, in-transit=721 (large pipeline). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods; I'll set L explicit=3. To capture the recent demand level and recent volatility I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 5 demand samples). This keeps orders aligned to the current demand regime while the large in-transit stock reduces risk of stockouts.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=721. History has multiple concluded observations confirming actual lead time = 3 periods (consistent P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, etc.). To ensure pipeline covers the extra delay and (L+1) periods of demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine balance service level (profit=$4 vs holding=$1) automatically.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: recent demand has spiked and become volatile (last 5 demands: P40=175, P41=90, P42=66, P43=352, P44=349). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals). To protect service while accounting for confirmed longer lead time and recent high demand, I set L explicitly=3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This raises target base-stock to cover 4 periods of elevated demand while using recent samples to avoid diluting the signal with older low-demand periods; it also mitigates lost/delayed shipment risk by matching observed W=3.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations). On-hand=0 but in-transit=1058 (large pipeline) \u2014 many units are already en route with 3-period arrival delay. I set L explicit=3 to align OR parameters with observed actual lead time. Demand historical samples (provided) imply mean \u224892.4; (1+L)=4 \u2192 forecast (1+L)*mean \u2248370, so I set mu_hat explicit=370 to ensure coverage over the review+lead horizon given high pipeline and volatile demand. I use sigma_hat default so the backend computes volatility from all samples adjusted by sqrt(1+L). These choices (L=3, mu_hat high enough) protect service level given delayed arrivals while sigma_hat default lets the OR engine size safety stock against demand variability and holding cost tradeoffs.

Demand samples (provided) have mean 92.4. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed W=3 lead time so the OR engine plans across the correct pipeline length. For demand forecast I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this leverages all available samples while the explicit L corrects for previously missing/delayed shipments and avoids under-ordering given large in-transit volume.

Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1058 \u2014 substantial pipeline expected to arrive but arrivals are seen with W=3 delay. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures full-sample dispersion given variable demand). This ensures orders cover the 4-period demand window (current + 3-period lead) while the OR engine balances profit vs holding cost using its base-stock formulation.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods. To ensure pipeline coverage for (1+L) periods and avoid stockouts while accounting for holding cost, I set lead time explicitly to 3.

Period 50: demand history shows large variability with several sustained high-demand episodes. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders observed with W=3). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=1058 (many units en route). Given the clear, sustained lead-time shift to 3, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses empirical average (will reflect W=3). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand across (1+L) using all samples and captures overall variability; this balances service (higher L increases coverage) against holding cost while backend's cap will limit excessive ordering despite large pipeline.
