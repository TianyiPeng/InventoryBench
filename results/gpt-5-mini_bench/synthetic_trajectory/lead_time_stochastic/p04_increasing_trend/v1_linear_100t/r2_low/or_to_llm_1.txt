Inventory state: on-hand=0, in-transit=11864 (no ETA breakdown available). Demand outlook: recent single-period demand (P42\u2013P46) = [4099,4417,4470,4605,4638], average \u22484446 units/period. Four periods remain (47\u201350) \u2192 expected demand \u224817,784 units. Pipeline shortfall \u224817,784 \u2212 11,864 = 5,920 units. Timing: promised lead time = 2 periods, so an order placed in Period 47 would arrive during Period 49 and can only cover demand for Periods 49\u201350 (not 47\u201348). Given remaining horizon and unstable but generally reliable arrivals from large in-transit volumes, I will top up to cover the projected shortfall for the final periods while avoiding excessive overstock (holding cost = profit per unit). Decision: place an order of 6,000 units to cover the estimated shortfall (~5,920), rounded to a clean integer and providing a small buffer for partial lost shipments. This balances risk of unmet demand in the last two periods against high holding cost that would negate profit for unsold units. I leave carry-over insights unchanged.",
