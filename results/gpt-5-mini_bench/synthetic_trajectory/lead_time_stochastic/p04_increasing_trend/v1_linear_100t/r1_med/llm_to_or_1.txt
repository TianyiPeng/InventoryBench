Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_1. Historical demand shows a sustained upward regime over the most recent 3+ periods (samples: 298, 376, 544). No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes. I keep L as 'default' (promised 2 periods). To capture the recent upward demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses last 3 samples) so the OR engine plans to cover the higher recent mean and observed volatility. This increases service level while avoiding excess inventory growth given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Periods 3-5 average = 406 vs Periods 1-2 average = 180 (+~126 units, +70%).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=613 (order from P1). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unconfirmed; possible delay but insufficient evidence to change promised lead time. Use promised lead time to let OR backend account for expected L=2. Demand history shows recent uptrend but a carry-over insight already recorded for that shift; rely on full-sample defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (captures higher mean via defaults) while not overreacting to an unconfirmed shipment delay.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period: Period_3. Demand context: recent historical series shows rising demand (carry-over note: prior detected regime shift). On-hand=0, in-transit=1092 (orders from P1+P2); these are expected to arrive during Period_3 (visible in Period_4 conclude) given promised L=2, so no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipments yet. Choose L=default (use promised lead time) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost conservatively given the recent upward trend but lack of confirmed sustained new regime evidence.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=1092. No concluded arrivals yet beyond recorded concludes (orders placed in P1/P2 still show arrived=0 in conclude messages) \u2014 no confirmed lead-time change, so use promised lead time. Recent demand has shifted up versus earliest samples; to be responsive to higher recent demand I use recent_N=3 (most recent 3 periods) for both mu and sigma so the (1+L)-period forecast emphasizes the latest regime and increases replenishment while keeping L at default. This balances service (capture rising demand) vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $967.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5. Recent demand is higher (recent 3-period average elevated vs early periods); on-hand=297, in-transit=479 (likely P2 order delayed but still en route). Observed arrival pattern shows actual lead time=3 (P1->P4), so use calculated lead time to capture delay. Set L via "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 3). For demand, use recent_N with N=3 to focus forecast on the higher recent regime (gives (1+L)-scaled mean over last 3 samples). For volatility, use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while acknowledging longer lead time and avoiding under-ordering given delayed in-transit shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1188.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start. Recent demand has shifted higher (Periods 3-5 avg \u2248 377.7 vs Periods 1-2 avg \u2248 179.5). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 871 (includes older orders; note Period 2 order (479) has not concluded and may be delayed/lost). Lead time evidence: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 \u2192 actual lead time = 3. To maintain service with confirmed longer lead time and recent higher demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=3, Periods 3-5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime, keeping safety stock responsive to the spike while avoiding excessive holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and large in-transit. These parameters prioritize meeting elevated demand over minimizing holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and zero on-hand.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent demand has accelerated (P4=316, P5=479, P6=616). On-hand=0, in-transit=1395 which covers some but not all of a longer lead-time demand window. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (P1 order arrived P4). Because actual lead time is confirmed and demand has shifted upward in the last 3 periods, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (focus on P4\u2013P6) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 periods to capture the new higher regime. For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices ensure the OR backend raises the base stock to meet the sustained higher demand while acknowledging confirmed longer lead time and current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg increased from 406 (Periods 3-5) to 470.33 (Periods 4-6) (+15.8%)

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=2113. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 (P1 order arrived in P4). Recent demand has accelerated (Periods 5-7 = 479,616,687) so I bias forecasts toward the newest regime. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed LT. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility of the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring pipeline covers the next 4 periods of demand while balancing holding costs given large in-transit stock.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: recent demand has risen sharply (P4-P8 = 316,479,616,687,800) and on-hand=310, in-transit=1444. Observed concluded lead times: 3 (P1->P4), 3 (P5->P8), 1 (P7->P8) \u2192 recent variability but average of last 3 observed = 2.333. I set L using recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent lead-time evidence. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime (periods 4\u20138 mean \u2248579.6) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean. Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to cover the sustained higher demand while letting the OR backend cap orders per its policy given holding cost vs profit tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3004.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 with rapidly rising demand (recent demands P6-P9 = 616,687,800,943). On-hand=0, in-transit=1884 (sufficient pipeline but some shipments showed variable lead times). Observed concluded lead times = [3,3,1,1], average = 2.0 \u2192 use calculate to set L to the observed average. For demand forecast and volatility use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, allowing it to incorporate full history while respecting the inferred lead time. This balances higher service level for rising demand against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime changes detected here.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 11, on-hand=0, in-transit=2062. Recent demand has risen and remained high since Period 6 (periods 6-10 demands = 616,687,800,943,1021). Lead-time evidence (P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8) confirms actual lead time \u22483 periods. To cover review+lead demand and protect service level given sustained higher demand, I set L explicit=3. I forecast mu_hat explicitly using the mean of recent 5 periods (avg=813.4) scaled by (1+L)=4 \u2192 mu_hat=3253.6. For volatility I use recent_N with N=5 to capture elevated variability in the same recent window. These parameters allocate more pipeline to avoid stockouts while the OR backend will cap orders; this balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) by sizing base stock to the elevated recent demand and its variability.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_12. On-hand=0, in-transit=3155. Observed concluded lead times: 3 (P1->P4), 3 (P5->P8), 1 (P7->P8), 1 (P8->P9) \u2192 average = 2. Use L='calculate' to let backend compute average observed lead time (2). Demand history (P1\u2013P11) mean \u2248614.8. With L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods; default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean \u2192 backend will set 3\xd7mean \u22481844.5. In-transit (3155) comfortably covers the 3-period demand forecast so no increased target needed. Use default sigma_hat so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving measured variability. This balances service (using observed lead time and full-sample demand mean) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period_13: recent demand has risen markedly (Periods 6-12: 616, 687, 800, 943, 1021, 1194, 1137) vs earlier periods \u2014 a sustained higher regime since Period 6 (matches prior carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=2096 (sizable pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are variable (observed W={3,3,1,1,3,2}); to capture actual behaviour I let backend compute average observed lead time via 'calculate'. For demand I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the new high-demand regime: (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent N samples (N chosen to cover the post-changepoint regime). I also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in recent high-demand periods. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid systematic underordering given delayed/lumpy arrivals.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. Recent realized demands (Periods 6-13) show a sustained, higher-demand regime (~600-1381 units) versus early-sample base; on-hand=0, in-transit=3374 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [3,3,1,1,3,2] \u2192 use average to capture variable/shifted transport timing. Set L by calculate to reflect observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=8, covering Periods 6-13) because a sustained regime shift occurred around Period 6 with much higher demand; this gives the OR engine a demand forecast that matches the current high regime and avoids underordering. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=8) to reflect current volatility rather than long-ago low-demand variability. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat under current regime) against holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline and variable lead times.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. On-hand=0, in-transit=2792 which currently covers ~2+ periods of recent high demand (~1,200 units/period). Historical concluded lead times show variability but majority are 3 periods (observed lead_times = [3,3,1,1,3,2,3]); demand has remained in the higher regime since Period 6. To let the OR engine incorporate the observed lead-time distribution I request L via 'calculate' (average observed lead time). For demand and volatility I'll use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) and lets the capped ordering rule balance service vs holding given profit/holding costs. This acknowledges the confirmed high-demand regime and large in-transit pipeline while letting the OR engine compute base_stock consistent with its statistics.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=2951. Recent realized demands (Periods 11-15) are high: [1194,1137,1381,1326,1672], mean=1342. In-transit (~2951) covers ~2.2 periods at this demand \u2014 risk of stockout if shipments are delayed. Observed lead times (concludes) recent sequence = [3,3,1,1,3,2,3]; last 5 average = 2.0, so I set L using recent_N to reflect the recently shorter average. Demand appears to have shifted to a higher regime; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to anchor the base-stock to the latest mean (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent). Volatility is based on the same recent window (recent_N N=5) to capture current variability. These choices prioritize service (profit > holding cost) while keeping safety stock responsive to recent lead-time improvements and the sustained high-demand regime.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=3359. Recent concluded arrivals confirm predominant lead time=3 (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P11->P14, P13->P16). Demand has shifted up: recent periods (P12-P16) show high demand (1137,1381,1326,1672,1542) -- use recent data to capture current regime. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses periods P12-P16) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std, balancing higher service level against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent demand is high (Periods 13-17 avg \u2248 1521.6 units/day). On-hand=510, in-transit=2912 \u2192 total pipeline=3422, which is well below (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand if L\u22482\u20133. Lead-time observations in conclude messages show multiple 3-period arrivals recently but also some 1\u20132s; I use a short recent average to capture current variability. I set L using recent_N=5 of observed lead times to bias toward the most recent mix (avg \u22482.4). For demand I use recent_N=5 (Periods 13\u201317) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (mean \u22481521.6). For volatility I use recent_N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices push the OR backend to a higher base stock appropriate for the new high-demand regime while reflecting observed lead-time variability so orders are sized to reduce stockouts without excessive holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=4705. Recent demand (Periods 13-18) is elevated and stable (avg \u22481566.8 over 6 periods). Lead-time observations (concluded arrivals) are mixed but average ~2.22 (multiple 3s but some 1s/2s). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-times average; mu_hat use recent_N with N=6 to anchor forecast to the most recent high-demand regime; sigma_hat use recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet sustained higher demand while using recent volatility to balance holding costs against service level given large pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: recent demand has moved to a much higher regime (Periods 13-19 avg ~1626.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=5972 which roughly matches one cycle of expected demand but leaves little buffer given confirmed longer lead times. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 (repeated P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16, P14->P17). I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to plan for the confirmed lead time and avoid stockouts from lost/delayed 1-2 period arrivals. For mu_hat I use an explicit forecast for the review+lead period: (1+L)*mean(demand Periods13-19) = 4*1626.7 \u2248 6507 to reflect the new sustained higher demand. For sigma_hat I provide an explicit volatility estimate scaled for the review+lead window (approx 2\xd7std of recent demands) = 428 to capture the observed variability and keep target base-stock conservative. These parameters align the OR backend to prioritize service (higher q via profit/holding) while acknowledging holding cost by using recent regime stats and confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg demand Periods 13-19 = 1626.7 vs prior ~470.3 (Periods 4-6/4-6 baseline) \u2014 increase \u2248 +1096 (+233%); Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (multiple observed orders: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17).

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations), and demand has shifted to a high regime starting Period 13 (Periods 13-19 avg \u22481626.7). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time (captures confirmed 3-period reality). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 13-19) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples, and sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align order targets with the confirmed longer lead time and the new high-demand regime, avoiding stockouts while controlling excess holding given high per-unit profit vs holding cost.

Lead-time observations (multiple concluded arrivals) are dominated by 3-period events but include some 1s and a 2; average observed lead time \u22482.22. To capture the sustained high-demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average observed W).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_25. On-hand=0, in-transit=7821. Historical concluded arrivals confirm sustained lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Demand has a sustained high-demand regime since ~Period_13 (periods 13\u201324 average \u2248 2164). To cover review+lead demand I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. For demand I use a recent_N window covering the confirmed high-demand regime (N=12, Periods 13\u201324) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent via recent_N. This raises target base-stock to meet elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders; using recent statistics reduces stockouts given overdue/lost orders history.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. On-hand=0, in-transit=7222. Historical conclude messages show sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals across history). Demand has been in a high regime since Period 13 (recent demands ~1800-2500); to capture current elevated mean/volatility I use a recent-window covering the post-changepoint regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=3. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (Periods 13\u201325) to forecast (1+L)-period demand and its volatility under the sustained high-demand regime. This raises target base-stock/service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies high critical fractile) while using recent demand stats to avoid over/under-shoot given large pipeline and holding cost exposure.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: recent demand remains in the high regime (Periods 13-26 average >> earlier periods). Concluded arrivals show persistent lead_time ~3 (multiple confirms through Period 20). To capture sustained high demand I use a recent-window demand estimate over the post-shift regime (Periods 13-26, length=14) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand and volatility. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (evidence points to ~3). This balances service (higher mu_hat for the sustained high-demand regime) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent volatility.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: recent demand has settled at a much higher regime (Periods 13-27 average \u22481979 units/period). On-hand=0, in-transit=7740 (insufficient to cover (1+L) periods at high demand). Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=3. Therefore I set L explicit=3 to match observed lead time; mu_hat explicit = (1+L)*forecast where forecast = mean demand(Periods13-27)=1979 \u2192 mu_hat=4*1979=7916 to cover review+lead demand; sigma_hat explicit set to 6000 to reflect high volatility in this elevated-demand regime and keep safety stock generous. These parameters align supply with the confirmed higher demand and longer lead time, prioritizing service given high profit vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1448.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=12604. Recent concluded arrivals and many orders show actual lead time = 3 periods (consistent historical pattern). Demand has run at much higher levels since Period_23 (six consecutive periods ~2449\u20132733). To match the recent sustained regime I set lead time explicitly to 3 so the backend computes (1+L)-period demand correctly. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and variability on the most recent 6 periods (Periods 23\u201328) where demand averaged ~2490.5, ensuring pipeline targets (order + on-hand + in-transit) cover the higher current demand while the OR cap still limits extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: avg demand Periods 23-28 = 2490.5 vs prior baseline 1626.7 (Periods 13-19) \u2014 increase \u2248 +863.8 (+53%), sustained for 6 periods

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=12448. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 23 (Periods 23-28 avg=2490.5) and multiple confirmed actual lead times of 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Pipeline is large but lead time appears to be 3 periods so plan using L=3. To capture the recent elevated demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (Periods 23-28) so the engine targets stocking for the new higher mean and observed volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts in current high-demand regime) versus holding cost by not using very long historical averages.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 31. On-hand=2360, in-transit=7222. Historical conclude messages show frequent actual lead_time \u22483 (many P\u2192P+3 arrivals) while promised=2; use backend 'calculate' so L reflects observed average. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher sustained regime since Period 13 with recent periods (P25\u2013P30) averaging ~2626 units; use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime. Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR engine toward stocking for the higher recent demand while letting L be set from observed arrivals to account for delayed shipments.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with many 3-period observations; to let backend compute robustly, set L by averaging observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent sustained high-regime samples (6 periods) so mu_hat reflects current elevated demand; match sigma_hat recent_N to capture current volatility. These choices keep orders aligned to the current high-demand regime while the large in-transit volume reduces new order sizes via the backend cap.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=10076. Historical concluded lead times show mixed but predominantly ~3 with several 1-2 observations; average observed lead time ~2.19. Recent demand (Periods 27-32) is in a sustained high regime: [2565,2733,2915,2866,3137,2897] -> mean \u22482852. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new high-demand regime (1+L multiplies the recent mean). Sigma uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders aligned to the confirmed higher-demand regime while the calculated L accounts for variable/occasionally-longer lead times and helps avoid underordering when some shipments are delayed or confirmed long.

Daily Reward (R_t): $11416.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: recent demand has been high and rising (Periods 28-33 avg \u22482980 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=7765 (covers ~2.6 recent-periods at current demand). Observed concluded lead times (17 observations) average \u22482.12; evidence shows lead time is shorter than earlier 3-period confirmations but variable. I set L=calculate to use the average of all observed lead times so OR backend accounts for the realized mix (\u22482.12). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 28-33) because a sustained high-demand regime has persisted for 6 periods (avg \u22482980); this focuses the forecast on the current regime and avoids dilution by earlier low-demand data. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=6 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These choices keep target base stock aligned with the recent high demand while using the observed shorter lead time to avoid over-ordering and excessive holding costs.

Observed concluded lead times average \u22482.06 \u2192 use calculate to let backend infer actual average from concluded history. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (7 periods, Periods 28-34) so the OR base-stock reflects current elevated demand and keeps safety stock proportional to recent volatility. This balances service level (reduce frequent stockouts) vs holding cost given high in-transit and high demand.

Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) with multiple 3-period observations earlier; to be conservative I let the backend compute an empirical average from observed concludes (method=calculate) for L. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 6). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=6) to reflect current volatility. This keeps target stock aligned to the sustained high-demand regime while letting the backend cap orders and balance service vs holding cost.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37: on-hand=0, in-transit=8318. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20133), with multiple confirmations of multi-period delays; to capture the realized variability I let the backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). Demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods (multi-period demands ~2000\u20133700); I therefore base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent data to reflect the current high-demand regime, using recent_N (N=10) for both mean and volatility so the OR base-stock and cap reflect the latest demand level and uncertainty while the backend combines with profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38: on-hand=0, in-transit=10946. Recent demand is in a high regime (Periods 30-37 demands ~2866\u20133748). Many concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133); to let backend infer systematic lead-time bias we use calculate (avg observed). Given strong recent demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus estimates on most recent data (N=6 covers recent high-demand periods) so the OR engine targets sufficient pipeline for (1+L) periods while keeping volatility measured on recent behavior. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given heavy recent demand) against holding cost since large in-transit already exists.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: recent demand is in the high 2000-3700 range (most recent demands P33-P38: 3332,3213,3490,3748,3643,3371). On-hand=0, in-transit=12404 (large pipeline) with a history of mixed actual lead times (1-3); recent arrivals show variability (recent observed lead times \u2248 1-2). To capture the current high-demand regime while accounting for recently variable lead time, I set L to recent_N (average of last 6 observed lead times) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 6 demand samples) so the OR engine targets the current high-demand level and recent volatility while the pipeline covers upcoming demand. This balances service (high forecast) vs holding cost by grounding forecasts in the most recent regime and lead-time behavior.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Recent demand regime is high (~3.3k\u20133.8k over last 5 periods) with on-hand=0 and large in-transit=10946. Lead times have been inconsistent but multiple concluded observations confirm many 3-period arrivals; recent mixes of 1\u20133 suggest using the empirical average. To keep the base-stock responsive to the current high-demand regime while accounting for pipeline, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 35\u201339) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and captures recent volatility rather than diluting with older low-demand history. This balances service (high fill during current peak) against holding cost by focusing forecasts on the sustained high-demand regime and letting the cap limit extreme orders.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Recent demand has been in a high regime (many periods of 2.5k\u20134.1k demand since Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=12846 (substantial pipeline but arrivals unknown until conclude). Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (1\u20133), with multiple confirmations of 3 earlier; shipments also sometimes arrive in 1\u20132 periods. To be conservative given mixed lead-time evidence but many long (3) observations, use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. For demand forecasting use recent data to capture the sustained high-demand regime: apply recent_N over the last 20 demand samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects current elevated mean and volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) while letting the OR backend cap orders via its cap to limit excess inventory and holding cost.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=12846, recent demand high (~3.6k\u20134.1k). Multiple concluded arrivals historically show variable lead times (1\u20133) and occasional delayed/lost shipments; therefore let backend compute average observed lead time. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher sustained regime; use the most recent 5 periods to reflect the current high-demand level for both mean and volatility so orders cover (1+L) periods of expected demand and react quickly to the current regime.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent demand has been at a high regime (Periods 36\u201342 mean \u2248 3,884 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=13,620 which comfortably covers our forecasted pipeline need. Observed lead times in recent concludes cluster near 1\u20132 periods (last 7 observed lead times = [2,1,1,2,2,1,1], avg \u2248 1.43). I set L using a recent average to reflect the faster recent arrivals while remaining cautious of occasional 2\u20133 delays. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 demand samples (Periods 36\u201342) to capture the current high-demand regime; this gives the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled forecast and volatility based on the most relevant data. With in-transit inventory > forecasted need, this approach avoids over-ordering while maintaining service given volatile recent lead times.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=11720. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but average \u22482 periods (multiple 3s and many 1-2s). Demand has been in a sustained high regime (~3.4k\u20134.4k) over the last 6 periods (P38\u2013P43). To reflect confirmed shorter/variable lead-time evidence I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (last 6 periods) so mu_hat reflects the current high-demand regime and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. These settings increase target base stock to meet very high near-term demand while sigma from recent data balances service level vs holding cost given large in-transit position.

LLM Rationale:
Period_45. On-hand=0, in-transit=14172 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show multiple confirmed 3-period lead times recently (several P\u2192P+3 arrivals) so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime (~4k+ per period in recent weeks); I use recent_N (N=5: Periods 40-44) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current high-demand regime. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to recent high demand while using observed lead-time behavior to avoid underordering given overdue/lost-order risk and large pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=13896. Historical concludes continue to show predominant lead_time=3 (e.g., P42\u2192P45 arrival), so set lead time inference to use observed data. Demand has been in a high regime for many periods (sustained 2000\u20134400+ range); to capture the current high-demand regime I use recent data rather than the long-ago low-sample baseline. Therefore: L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (reflecting repeated 3-period observations); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 periods, which balances responsiveness to the sustained high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. This choice helps the OR backend size orders to meet high demand without excessively inflating safety stock beyond recent variability, balancing service level against $1/unit holding cost.

I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (captures confirmed LT\u22483). For mu_hat I use 'recent_N' with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the sustained high-demand regime and reduces dilution from early low-demand periods). For sigma_hat I use 'recent_N' with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These settings aim to raise base-stock for high recent demand while recognizing pipeline (13896) to avoid excessive over-ordering given holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 48: recent demand has settled at a high regime (~4k+ per period). On-hand=0, in-transit=13,896. Multiple concluded messages historically confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. I set L explicitly to 3. For demand I focus on the most recent 5 periods (Periods 43-47) to capture the current high regime: use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This keeps the base-stock tuned to the current ~4.3k per-period demand while sigma from recent data controls safety stock; it balances service (high profit/higher q) against holding cost given already-large in-transit pipeline.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=17717. Historical concludes show most arrivals with 3-period lead time (multiple P1\u2192P4, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P20\u2192P23, P40\u2192P43), so use observed-average for L. Demand has clearly shifted to a much higher regime recently (Periods 44-48 demand = 4388,4407,4466,4468,4822); to capture current elevated mean/volatility I use recent_N on the last 5 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices ensure the OR backend targets safety stock appropriate for the new high-demand regime while recognizing large pipeline (17717) to avoid over-ordering.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: recent demand has settled at a very high regime (Periods 44-49 avg \u2248 4,599.8 units/period). On-hand=0, in-transit=17,717 (covers ~3.85 periods at recent demand). Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show a 3-period lead time\u2014treat L=3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid underordering from lost/delayed evidence. For demand I forecast the recent regime mean (Periods 44-49 mean \u2248 4,599.83) and multiply by (1+L)=4 \u2192 mu_hat explicit=18,399.33 to cover review+lead demand. Volatility estimated from same 6 recent periods: sample std \u2248247.51, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2 \u2192 sigma_hat explicit=495.02. These parameters give the OR engine a base-stock tuned to the confirmed high-demand regime and 3-period lead time, balancing service (high profit) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.
