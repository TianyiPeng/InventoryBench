Lead time & pipeline: in-transit=17807 units; history shows many actual lead_times=1\u20133 with several 3-period arrivals, so pipeline is best treated as slow. Inventory assessment: on-hand=0 but in-transit (17807) covers roughly 3\u20134 future periods at forecast demand (~4.7k), meeting the (L+1) coverage requirement conservatively. Ordering decision: avoid ordering now to prevent excess holding cost given large in-transit volume and risk of lost/delayed shipments; place 0 units so incoming pipeline can be observed and lead-time confirmed in upcoming concludes.",
