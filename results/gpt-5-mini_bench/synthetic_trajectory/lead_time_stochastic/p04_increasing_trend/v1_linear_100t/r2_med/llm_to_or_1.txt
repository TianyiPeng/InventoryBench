Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a clear upward shift in the most recent 3 periods (P3=298, P4=376, P5=544; recent mean=406 vs overall mean\u2248315), so I use recent_N to anchor forecast to the new, higher regime. Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet, so leave L as default. Chosen methods: L=default to respect promised lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent higher mean ( (1+L)\xd7recent mean ); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect volatility in the recent regime. This raises target base-stock to improve service during the upward demand trend while sigma_hat recent_N keeps safety stock proportional to recent variability.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=613 (order from P1 not yet concluded). Historical demand samples show rising demand (107,252,298,376,544) but only P1 conclude observed (arrived=0) so actual lead time not confirmed. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (avoid prematurely assuming lost/delayed shipment). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I also choose default so backend uses all samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level against holding cost given limited confirmed lead-time information.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=1095 (orders from P1,P2) and no concluded arrivals yet; this is consistent with promised lead time=2 (arrivals occur during Period_3 and will be seen in Period_4 conclude). No evidence of lost shipments or changed lead time (only two periods without conclude). Historical demand samples available (Periods 1\u20135). I choose default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This is conservative: it leverages full-sample statistics while allowing the OR engine to size orders against the current large in-transit pipeline and the promised lead time, avoiding overreaction to apparent non-arrivals that are expected to conclude next period.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4. On-hand=0, in-transit=1095 (orders placed earlier have not concluded arrival in history \u2192 overdue/delayed shipments likely). Demand history shows recent high/volatile demand but insufficient concluded arrivals to confirm a lead-time change (need 3+ periods of consistent evidence). I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=2) so the OR engine uses its prior; I also use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps a high service target (profit/holding implies high fill-rate) while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap formula; if shipments remain missing in future periods I will switch to an explicit or recent_N lead-time method.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1517.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. On-hand=187, in-transit=482 (includes Period_2 order that has not concluded). Historical conclude shows an order placed in Period_1 arrived in Period_4 \u2192 observed lead time = 3 periods (one confirmed sample). Demand history shows a clear recent upward shift; to capture the higher recent demand I use a recent-window forecast. Choose L by 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (will reflect the confirmed 3). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to weight the most recent regime (captures the recent demand spike and volatility). This raises the base-stock to prioritize service given profit=4 and holding=1 while guarding against lost/delayed shipments by relying on observed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (order from Period_1 arrived in Period_4)

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: recent demand has risen sharply (Period_1-5 demands: 146,166,368,426,507) \u2014 a sustained higher regime from Period_3\u20135 (avg recent 3 = (368+426+507)/3 \u2248 433). On-hand=0, in-transit=1027 (orders from P2 and P5) with no recent arrivals -> overdue/delayed shipments suspected but prior conclude confirmed lead time=3 (P1 arrived in P4). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (covers periods 3\u20135). For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These parameters increase target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new higher demand while recognizing overdue in-transit volume to avoid overordering.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 decision. Recent demand has jumped (periods 4-6 = 426, 507, 636) vs earlier samples; holding cost $1 << profit $4 so aim higher service. On-hand=0, in-transit=1576 (large pipeline) but past history confirms actual lead time=3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed 3-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new, higher regime (mean of last 3 periods = 523) and scale by (1+L) in backend. For volatility I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand while acknowledging the long lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent demand has jumped and remained high (Periods 5-7: 507, 636, 618). On-hand=0, in-transit=2271 (multiple outstanding orders). Historical concluded data confirms actual lead time = 3 (Period_1 order arrived in Period_4). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses confirmed longer lead time. Demand appears to have shifted upward; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent regime, which increases target base-stock to protect service against stockouts while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend's q calculation.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. Recent demand history shows a rising demand regime (sample series 107,252,298,376,544) and arrivals history contains mixed lead-time signals but two clear 3-period observations (P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8) and one 1-period anomaly (P7\u2192P8). Current inventory: on-hand=465, in-transit=1031 (pipeline healthy). I choose L=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the dominant 3-period signal while accounting for the 1-period anomaly). For demand sizing I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level given elevated recent demand against holding cost. This approach is conservative and leverages confirmed lead-time evidence without overreacting to the single short-arrival anomaly.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand samples show rising demand; use lead-time inference across observed concludes to capture actual lead-time shift. Set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively\u2014this balances higher service level from longer inferred lead time against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 11. On-hand=0, in-transit=2116. Recent demand has shifted sharply up (Periods 6-10 demands: 636, 618, 775, 831, 993) vs earlier lower-sample history. Observed lead times are mixed but historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period realizations; however a 1-period arrival occurred once. I select L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (uses concluded messages) rather than trusting promised 2. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 6-10). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices make mu_hat and sigma_hat focus on the elevated recent demand, ensuring the OR engine raises base stock to prevent stockouts given substantial in-transit volume and elevated demand while accounting for recent variance.

Historical concluded lead times: 3 (P1->P4), 3 (P5->P8), 1 (P7->P8) \u2014 evidence of variable but elevated lead time; use backend-average of observed lead times to capture this (method=calculate). Demand samples mean=315.4 (Periods 1-5) with recent upward trend; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently with chosen L. This balances service (raising order-up-to via larger L) against holding cost given large in-transit stock and occasional long delays.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=0, in-transit=2055. History shows confirmed lead time = 3 (orders from P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12). Recent demand has trended upward (P8\u2013P12: 775,831,993,1136,1302). To cover the review+lead period and reflect the recent higher demand regime, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast and variability I use recent_N with N=5 (last five observed demands) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the upward shift and short-term volatility. This keeps the base-stock targeted at recent demand over the longer observed lead time and avoids understock given prior lost/long shipments.

Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand while the averaged L accounts for realized delays and the large pipeline, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Given large pipeline (2396) and confirmed multi-period lead times, set L using calculate (average observed) so backend uses inferred lead-time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (higher base-stock from longer L) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=3228. Historical concluded lead times show repeated 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14) so actual lead time appears centered at 3. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps base-stock tied to full (review+lead) demand given the confirmed longer lead time and avoids overreacting to recent zero on-hand while substantial pipeline exists.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5460.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=2070. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders from P1,P5,P9,P11,P13 arrived after 3 periods). Demand has shifted up starting around Period 9 (periods 9-16 demands: 831,993,1136,1302,1175,1417,1436,1578) \u2014 sustained higher regime. I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (the 8-period high-demand regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and volatility over the review+lead horizon, improving service while preventing excess holding given higher holding cost relative to profit.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=3505. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times with many 3-period observations (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16) plus some 1-2 period arrivals; average observed lead time \u22482.38. Pipeline (3505) is large relative to recent demand samples but arrival timing is uncertain; to account for observed longer-than-promised lead times I use calculate for L (let backend average observed lead times). For demand I use default (backend will scale (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma (backend sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine combines the adjusted lead-time with historical demand statistics to set base-stock while respecting the cap. This balances service (accounting for ~2.38 observed lead time) against holding cost given current heavy pipeline.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 19. On-hand=0, in-transit=3814. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=3) though occasional 1-2 period arrivals occurred. Demand has shifted up materially starting Period 6 and sustained through Period 18. Decision: set lead time explicitly to 3 to guard against delayed arrivals (protect service level given observed 3-period pattern). For demand, use recent_N on the post-change regime (Periods 6-18) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher demand (N=13). This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new higher-demand regime and increases safety stock via sigma_hat recent estimate, balancing profit vs holding cost given frequent stockouts when using old low demand estimates.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg increased from 322.6 to 1180.4 (+266%)

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: recent history shows frequent 3-period arrivals with occasional 1\u20132 period early arrivals; on-hand=0, in-transit=5385 (large pipeline). Demand samples show a sustained higher regime since Period 6. To be conservative about lead time variability, set L by averaging observed lead times. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this leverages full history while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate stockout risk.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_21: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (carry-over: demand regime shift to ~1180+ avg) and confirmed longer lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=5385 (covers some upcoming demand but arrival timing uncertain). I set L explicit=3 because multiple concluded orders show a 3-period lead time (Period_1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16). For demand I use recent_N N=5 (Periods 16-20 demands = 1578,1586,1862,1750,2032) to capture the new high-demand regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7mean of these recent samples so the OR engine orders to cover the review+lead horizon under current demand. For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability and ensure safety stock scales with observed short-run std. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand regime while avoiding excess long-term holding given significant in-transit inventory.

Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime (recent periods 17-21 large); use recent demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend stocks for current high-demand regime and avoids under-ordering given large pipeline.

I set L by averaging observed concluded lead times to capture the confirmed 3-period behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the latest high-demand regime (most relevant for the (1+L) review+lead forecast). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while the OR backend will cap orders to avoid excessive arrivals against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period_24. Demand has shown a sustained, large upward shift since Period_6 (carry-over noted). On-hand=0, in-transit=5863 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are variable but recent average ~2.0; I use a recent lead-time estimate to reflect current variability. For demand I use recent_N across the post-shift regime (Period_6 onward) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher-demand regime and reduce stockouts. These choices (recent lead time and recent-demand estimates) help the OR engine size base stock for higher mean demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sample avg \u22482.2), including multiple 3-period arrivals, so I use a lead-time estimate based on observed average. To keep the OR backend responsive to the new high-demand regime while accounting for delayed arrivals, I select L=calculate (average observed lead time), set mu_hat using the most recent 5 periods to capture the elevated demand regime (recent_N, N=5), and set sigma_hat from the same recent window to reflect current volatility (recent_N, N=5). These choices prioritize service (higher base stock from elevated recent mean) while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering when shipments are delayed.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: on-hand=0, in-transit=7904. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sample average \u22482.09 periods) and a sustained high-demand regime since Period_19. To reflect the true lead-time mix I ask backend to calculate L from observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (most recent demands: Periods 21\u201325), and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while letting the backend compute safety stock given the inferred lead time.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=8960. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (multiple 1\u20133 values) but overall average > promised. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend infer the observed average lead time from concluded arrivals. Demand underwent a sustained upward regime (noted in history), so I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (~Periods 7\u201326). This increases order targets to cover the higher demand while reflecting recent variability; using calculate/recent_N balances service level against holding cost given high profit:holding ratio.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: demand has risen sharply and stabilized at high levels since the previously recorded regime shift around Period 19. On-hand=0, in-transit=8960 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary but multiple earlier confirms show 3-period delays; to be conservative I let backend compute average observed lead time (method=calculate). For demand I use a recent_N estimate (last 9 periods since the regime shift) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new high-demand regime and reduce stockouts while the large in-transit position will be reconciled by the OR engine.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=7904. Historical concluded lead times show mixed values but average ~2.17 \u2192 use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 24-28) is elevated (2504,2479,2457,2508,2890); this reflects the sustained high-demand regime detected earlier, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high mean over the review+lead period. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These settings bias orders toward meeting the new high demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff and observed lead-time average.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=9776. Historical concludes confirm a sustained demand regime shift upward (change detected at Period_6 with much higher demands since) and multiple arrivals showing variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133, earlier confirmation of 3). To capture true lead-time behavior I ask backend to compute the average of observed lead times (method=calculate). For demand I target the post-shift regime using most recent data: use recent_N with N=20 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean over the latest regime window, so the base-stock reflects the higher demand level and reduces stockouts. For volatility I use recent_N N=20 to reflect current variability for safety stock. These choices help the OR engine balance higher service needs after the confirmed demand increase while letting the averaged lead time and recent volatility guard against missing/delayed shipments in the pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=9776. Historical concluded arrivals show varied lead times (observed sample average \u22482.17 periods) and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 6 (recent demands ~2.4k\u20133.0k). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures observed ~2.17). For demand, I use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent sustained high-demand regime, reducing bias from the earlier low-demand samples. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect current volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while letting the backend cap orders to limit overstock given holding cost.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=9776. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (observations: 3,3,1,3,2,3,3,1,2,1,2,2 \u2192 avg\u22482.17) and a prior confirmed demand regime shift (large increase around Period 6\u219219). Because lead time is clearly variable and averaged above the promised 2, I select L by averaging observed lead times to let the OR engine account for longer/variable arrivals. For demand and volatility I use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine apply the full sample history while respecting the inferred longer lead time. This balances service (protecting against delayed arrivals) versus holding cost by increasing the review+lead demand estimate but leaving safety-stock sizing to the OR formula.

On-hand=0, in-transit=9776 \u2014 this pipeline likely covers multiple upcoming periods so avoid overordering. Observed realized lead times vary (1\u20133) so use calculate to reflect empirical average; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, letting the backend balance service vs. holding cost given the large pipeline.

Demand history (seed samples) is the provided five-sample series; no new sustained demand regime beyond previously recorded insight. I choose L='calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20133 observations). For demand and volatility I choose defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (using observed longer-than-promised lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit stock. No explicit adjustments\u2014keep policy responsive to backend's base-stock calculation while acknowledging overdue/in-transit inventory.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed sample avg \u22482.17 periods) with many 2\u20133 period arrivals and occasional 1s; several earlier shipments completed but recent periods show no new concludes despite large in-transit (possible delays/lost). Demand has clearly shifted upward and sustained for many periods\u2014use a recent-window forecast to capture the higher recent mean/volatility. Therefore: L set to 'calculate' to let backend infer the empiric average lead time from observed concludes; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=10 to focus on the most recent elevated-demand regime and reduce influence of the low-demand early periods. These choices balance service (capture increased recent demand and observed longer lead time) against holding cost by avoiding over-reliance on long-run low-demand history.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 36. On-hand=0, in-transit=11153. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period arrivals (confirmed Period 5) and mixed 1-3 elsewhere; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime (noted previously at Period 19 referencing shift at Period 6). Recent demands (Periods 31-35 = 3152,3151,3344,3383,3624) are the best forecast basis. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime over the review+lead horizon, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given large in-transit volume but still-zero on-hand, while sigma_hat recent_N ensures safety stock reflects recent variability.

Demand has sustained, higher regime since ~Period_19 (recent demands ~2.5k\u20133.8k); to reflect the current high-demand regime I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures most recent behavior while smoothing). This keeps inventory targets responsive to the elevated demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock given the inferred lead time and recent variability. No single overdue/lost shipment pattern requires forcing an explicit L.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=10832. Historical concludes show persistent longer-than-promised lead times (multiple observed W=3) and a sustained high-demand regime since Period_6. I therefore let backend compute an empirical lead time average from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). For demand I bias to the recent high-demand regime by using the last 20 samples for the review+lead demand forecast and volatility (recent_N N=20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained elevated demand and reduce stockouts given large in-transit but variable arrivals. This balances higher service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost by focusing on recent high demand while letting OR cap orders.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40. On-hand=0, in-transit=10221 (sufficient pipeline to cover many periods of current high demand). Observed concluded lead times average ~2.0 (mix of 1\u20133) so no change from promised. Demand exhibited a sustained step-up around Period_6\u201319 (recorded previously) and recent arrivals/pipeline are large; therefore use default calculations so the OR backend applies its full-sample demand stats and promised lead time to compute base-stock and caps, avoiding overreaction to in-transit volume or recent noise.

On-hand=0, in-transit=9805 \u2014 significant pipeline but mixed/variable arrival lags observed (lead times of 1\u20133 periods in concluded messages), so I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time. I select L='calculate' to reflect the observed mixture; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, balancing higher service level from increased demand against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Demand has permanently shifted higher (carry-over earlier noted); recent 5-period mean demand \u22483951 so use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the current high-demand regime. This balances service (covering current high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and uncertain arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=13922. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (1\u20133) with an earlier confirmed 3-period event; demand clearly shifted upward around Period_6 (noted earlier). I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded arrivals. For demand I detect a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period_19; I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent stable high-demand regime (use max 20 samples). This balances service (capture elevated mean) vs holding cost by basing safety stock on recent variability rather than long-ago low demand.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: demand has been in the higher regime since Period_6 (large, sustained increase). On-hand=0, in-transit=13922 (significant pipeline). Observed lead times vary (1\u20133) and prior analysis confirmed a 3-period lead once; use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (most recent 20 periods) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 to reflect volatility in the recent high-demand regime. These choices prioritize matching the OR base-stock to the elevated, persistent demand while the large in-transit quantity will reduce net ordering via the capped policy.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45. Historical concludes show actual lead times varying but averaging \u22481.9 periods (multiple 1\u20133 observations, including confirmed 3 at Period_5). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift at Period_6 to much higher levels, so I rely on the most recent regime for forecasting. On-hand=0, in-transit=13922 (large pipeline that will cover several future periods). Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture empirical variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to reflect the post-shift high-demand regime and recent volatility, which helps the OR backend size base stock for service while controlling holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. On-hand=0, in-transit=9805 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times average 2.0 (multiple observed: 1\u20133 periods) so use calculated L to reflect recent mixed evidence. Demand has been at a higher regime for many periods; use recent_N (last 5 periods) to capture current elevated mean/volatility (Periods 41\u201345 demands: 3997,4099,4417,4470,4605). These parameters let the OR backend size base stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon using recent high demand while sigma from the same recent window yields appropriate safety stock; large in-transit reduces ordering via pipeline subtraction.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: demand has been high and rising for many periods (recent demands ~4099,4417,4470,4605,4638). On-hand=0, in-transit=14547. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=3 in multiple periods. To prioritize service given high profit ($4) vs holding ($1) and large in-transit, I set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand I use a recent_N (N=5) forecast to capture the current high-regime mean ((1+L) periods covered). Volatility also estimated from the same recent 5 periods so the OR backend sizes safety stock to recent variability while capping orders by its policy. This balances high service needs against holding cost and accounts for confirmed longer lead time and large in-transit inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=18145. Recent history shows confirmed variable lead times (including confirmed 3-periods earlier) and a large, sustained demand regime shift beginning around Period 6 onward. In-transit stock (18145) is substantial and likely intended to cover many future periods; no new conclude in Period 47 indicates some orders remain in-transit. To let the OR engine infer the true average lead time from concluded arrivals while keeping demand forecasting broad and stable given the sustained high-demand regime, I select: L by calculating the average of all observed lead times (method='calculate'); mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full demand history, providing conservative coverage under the higher-demand regime and letting the OR engine apply the capped ordering rule to avoid over-ordering versus holding cost.

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_6 (carry-over) and recent periods show much larger demand; to capture current demand level and volatility use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the most recent data and balances the high profit ($4) vs $1 holding cost by reflecting current demand rather than old low-demand samples. No new missing-shipment signal that would force explicit L increase.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=18145. Historical 'conclude' messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P23\u2192P26, P42\u2192P45) so actual lead time is persistently 3. Demand has shifted upward long ago and recent periods (roughly last 20) show much higher levels (~3000\u20134600); to capture the current demand regime I use recent data. I set L explicitly to 3 to align pipeline timing (protecting against late/lost shipments), mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on the latest regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service given high recent demand and large in-transit volume while letting the OR engine apply its cap to limit over-ordering.
