Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical samples (71,120,95,116,82). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals so no evidence of lead-time deviation or demand regime change. Use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand estimates so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps parameters conservative given no new info and ensures pipeline target covers (L+1) periods of demand.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: observed Period_1 conclude shows ordered=132 arrived=0; on-hand=0, in-transit=132. Promised lead time=2 and one period has not yet elapsed for arrival\u2014no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipment. Recent demand history shows moderate variability (samples available). Use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full sample mean/variance across provided history. This keeps the policy conservative given current pipeline and avoids overreacting to a single non-arrival.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=268 (orders from P1+P2 =132+136). No concluded arrivals yet beyond promised lead time; cannot confirm actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand stats: set L=default so backend uses promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current uncertainty and in-transit coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_4. History: orders placed in Period_1 (132), Period_2 (136), Period_3 (30) have not concluded as arrived by their expected windows, indicating lead-time problems or lost shipments. Promised lead time=2 but evidence suggests longer effective lead time; to be conservative set L explicit=3 to cover delayed arrivals. Demand historical mean = 96.8 (samples provided); using mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean) lets OR backend scale forecast with chosen L. sigma_hat default lets backend compute volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). With profit=holding, service target is 50% (q=0.5) so this configuration favors meeting demand while modestly limiting inventory given possible lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals: orders placed P1=132, P2=136, P3=30 did not arrive by expected lead-time windows; suspect lost shipments or actual lead time >=3 periods.

Daily Profit: $72.00, Daily Holding Cost: $90.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=90, in-transit=236 (total pipeline=326). History shows arrivals in Period_4: P1 order (132) arrived with lead_time=3, P3 order (30) arrived with lead_time=1; P2 order (136) still not concluded. Given mixed observed lead times, I use L='calculate' (average of observed lead times) so backend infers lead time from concluded data. Demand history samples (Periods 1-5) appear stable; I use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using observed lead-time evidence) versus holding cost conservatively while the system resolves missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order placed P1 arrived in Period_4, lead_time=3)

Daily Profit: $90.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: recent history shows inconsistent arrivals but at least one order exhibited lead_time=3 (P1\u2192arrived P4) while another showed lead_time=1 (P3\u2192arrived P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=296 (several outstanding orders beyond promised windows). To be conservative about delivery uncertainty I set L=calculate to let the backend average observed lead times. Demand history (samples: 71,120,95,116,82) used with default aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all data scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (higher base stock when average lead time > promised) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=394. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) mean=96.8, std computed from those samples. Concluded messages show actual lead time has shifted to 3 periods (order P1 arrived in P4 with lead_time=3) and several earlier shipments were delayed/missing. To capture the confirmed longer lead time I set L explicit=3 so the OR engine plans for a 4-period coverage window. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (conservative, uses full history) to replenish pipeline while accounting for higher lead-time exposure and avoiding stockouts from lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent demand has been high and variable (recent 5 demands 102,72,117,62,123; mean\u224895.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=294 (multiple delayed arrivals historically; evidence supports longer lead time). I set lead time explicitly to 3 (matches observed arrivals from P1->P4 and P4->P7). To capture the recent regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility over the most relevant samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent realized lead times from concluded messages are {3,1,3,3} with modal/median 3 and average 2.5; pipeline=321, on-hand=0 so substantial inventory is already in transit (some earlier shipments were delayed but recent arrivals show consistent 3-period behavior). I set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1/3 but leans toward 2.5). Demand has risen versus the 5-sample prior baseline; to bias the forecast toward recent higher demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the (1+L)\xd7mean uses the most recent regime data. Sigma_hat left as default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance higher safety stock for longer effective lead time and elevated recent demand while leveraging existing large in-transit inventory to avoid excessive new orders.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=0, in-transit=310. Historical concluded lead times: P1->3, P3->1, P4->3, P5->3, P8->1 (avg \u22482.2) and several 3-period arrivals indicate occasional LT=3; recent arrivals mix 3 and 1. To reflect observed variability while letting OR backend weight its promised LT=2, I ask backend to calculate L from observed lead times (uses full sample average) and use default demand sizing (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the engine applies (1+L) scaling to historical demand samples. This balances service level (captures longer observed L) without overfitting short recent swings or manually overriding demand volatility given current in-transit stock.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=384. History shows mixed but persistent delays (observed lead_times: 3,1,3,3,1 \u2192 avg=2.2), with multiple 3-period arrivals confirming longer-than-promised lead times. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures the empirical average). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages all demand history while letting the backend apply the profit/holding tradeoff; using empirical L reduces stockouts from delayed arrivals while default volatility preserves measured uncertainty.

LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=384, recent concludes show mixed lead times (observed: 3,1,3,3,1 \u2192 average ~2.2) and multiple delayed/missing arrivals earlier. I choose to let the backend infer a longer effective lead time by using 'calculate' (average observed lead times) and keep demand estimates conservative by using defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service (accounts for longer realized lead times) while avoiding overfitting to short-term spikes given noisy arrivals.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) mean ~96.8; current on-hand=47, in-transit=234. Concluded arrivals show variable but skewed-to-long lead times (observed lead times sequence includes recent values [2,3,1,3,3]); average of last 5 observed lead times = 2.4 \u2192 choose recent_N for L to capture the recent higher-than-promised lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand forecast and volatility by (1+L) consistently with chosen L, ensuring orders cover the review+lead period while the capped order prevents excessive holdings given equal profit/holding cost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded lead times show variability with a recent cluster around 3 (recent observed lead times sequence: 3,3,1,3,2 \u2192 avg 2.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=316 so pipeline is large but arrivals have been delayed historically; using a recent-average lead time captures the elevated/variable lead time. Demand has been somewhat stable recently (last 5 periods demand: 109,111,96,103,81) so I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest regime and variability. These choices increase the (1+L) forecast to cover delayed arrivals while keeping volatility rooted in recent demand to avoid excessive holding cost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=360. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but a clear tendency toward ~3 periods (observed lead times: 3,1,3,3,1,3,2). Given multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals and several late/missing earlier arrivals, I use an observed-average lead time to let the OR engine account for longer effective pipeline. I select L=calculate so backend averages observed lead times. Demand samples (71,120,95,116,82) are limited and show no sustained recent mean shift, so I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to balance service level vs holding cost while letting the OR engine apply the capped ordering rule. This approach acknowledges overdue/lost shipments by using observed lead-time evidence while avoiding overfitting demand with scant samples.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period start: Period_16. On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical concluded lead-time observations: {3,1,3,3,1,3,2} (avg \u22482.29) \u2014 persistent occurrences of 3-period leads but variability exists. Several early missing arrivals and later confirmations indicate lead-time regime shifted upward from promised 2 to ~2.3 on average; use calculated average to capture that. I choose L='calculate' so backend estimates average observed lead time. For demand forecast use default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to leverage entire sample history (no strong sustained demand regime change detected). Sigma use default to reflect full-sample volatility. These choices balance service (raising effective lead time raises required pipeline cover) while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise; default mu/sigma keep estimate stable given limited sample size and mixed signals about demand shifts.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=24, in-transit=287. History shows multiple concluded lead-time observations: {3,1,3,3,1,3,2,3} with a recent tendency toward 3 periods (many 3s and some 1-2). Some shipments were delayed/lost earlier, so I prefer an empirical average lead time. I set L to 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) to let backend capture the actual mix. Demand recently has been around ~93 units (last 5 periods mean=92.8); to focus the forecast on the most recent regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects current demand while accounting for the inferred lead time and existing pipeline. This balances service (higher L -> larger (1+L) forecast) against holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period deliveries (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17) with occasional 1\u20132 period fast arrivals; majority supports treating actual lead time > promised. I choose to let backend calculate average observed lead time (capture the empirical shift to 3). For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default to capture full-sample volatility. This biases orders upward to cover the longer effective pipeline and balances service vs holding given equal profit and holding costs.

I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures realized delays). For demand parameters I use defaults (mu_hat='default', sigma_hat='default') so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, letting the OR engine scale safety stock for the inferred longer lead time while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Concluded arrivals show actual lead times clustering at 3 periods (multiple observations). I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed shift to ~3). Demand forecast uses recent_N N=5 to focus mu_hat on the most recent high-demand regime (reduces under-forecasting from earlier low-sample mean). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the longer confirmed lead time and recent higher demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding given current large pipeline.

Many arrivals occur at +3, so use explicit L=3 to reflect observed lead time. Pipeline (371) covers several future periods but visibility lags one period; keep demand forecast responsive by using recent demand. Set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime over the last 5 periods, and use default sigma_hat to let backend compute volatility over full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices align supply with confirmed longer lead time while keeping the mean forecast adaptive to recent demand fluctuations and letting OR backend balance service vs holding cost.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level given higher effective pipeline and holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=376. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent lead_time=3 (multiple periods) with occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals; average observed lead time ~2.3. Pipeline is large but delayed historically, so use a lead-time estimate based on observed lead-times (calculate) so backend accounts for longer effective L. Demand has been consistently ~100+ in recent periods (sustained high regime over many periods), so I base demand forecast and volatility on the recent regime (last 10 periods) to reflect current higher mean and variability. These choices raise base_stock to protect service under longer observed L while keeping sigma from older low-demand periods to avoid understating variability.

History shows variable but frequently multi-period arrivals (observed lead times: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,1 \u2192 avg\u22482.3) and several delayed/lost shipments earlier. I set L to calculate so the backend uses the average observed lead time (captures realized delays). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand samples (stable estimator given mixed regimes). This balances service (accounting for longer realized lead times) against holding cost while relying on full-sample demand stats.

Use calculate for L so backend infers average actual lead time from concluded data. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand samples \u2014 this balances service vs holding given confirmed longer-than-promised lead times and preserves conservative safety stock until further sustained regime shifts are observed.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=388. History shows multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23) and intermittent shorter arrivals; several early-period orders also experienced long delays/losses. I select L="calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT\u22483 while weighting other observations). For demand sizing I use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, giving a robust base-stock anchored to the inferred lead time and historical demand. This balances service (accounting for the longer effective lead time) against holding cost while avoiding overreacting to short-term spikes.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple lead_time=3 observations (several orders) with occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals \u2014 evidence of a shifted/variable lead time. Use L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so demand forecast uses all available samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L). This keeps the OR engine aligned with the empirically observed lead-time regime while letting it balance service level vs holding cost automatically.

LLM Rationale:

Demand samples recent mean ~ (use backend default). To account for observed lead-time drift vs promised 2, I select calculate for L so backend uses average observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand statistics by (1+L) consistently. This balances service (longer realized lead time) against holding cost using the OR engine's base-stock calculation.

Historical conclude messages show multiple observed lead times (majority ~3, some 1\u20132). Many in-transit units and past missing arrivals justify using inferred lead-time from observations. Set L to 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) so backend uses empirical lead-time rather than promised 2. Use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Demand has no sustained regime shift (recent high in P35 appears isolated), so use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to balance service vs holding cost given uncertain arrivals.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38. Recent demand has shifted higher and more volatile (last 5 demands: 107, 42, 256, 120, 115; mean=128). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 pipeline sizeable but past history shows many 3-period arrivals. I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead-times to capture the persistent 3-period deliveries while allowing short 1\u20132 period noise (recent_N N=5). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to focus the forecast on the new higher regime (mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean of those 5). For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices steer the OR backend to a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given confirmed multi-period lead times and recent demand spike, while sigma_hat captures increased uncertainty to temper over-ordering.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_39: recent demand volatile with a large spike (Period_35=256). On-hand=0, in-transit=461 (covers multiple periods). Historical concluded lead times show consistent 3-period arrivals; therefore set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime (Periods 34-38 demands = 42,256,120,115,87) so the OR backend bases base-stock on the short-run mean/volatility and avoids overreacting to older data. This balances service (higher L and recent mean raise target stock) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Recent demand samples show high mean and variability (historic series includes spikes to 256 and many 100\u2013150 observations). On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,1,1,1,1} with average = 2.0, so use calculated lead time to reflect empirical average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) given profit=holding ($1/$1) \u2014 symmetric cost suggests median service level; large in-transit reduces need for extra explicit safety stock now.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: recent concluded history shows frequent 3-period deliveries (multiple orders with observed lead_time=3) so use a data-driven average lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (provides material coverage but several past shipments exhibited 3-period lag). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the persistent 3-period pattern). For demand parameters I choose defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service vs holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical conclude messages show confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained evidence). Recent demand (Periods 38\u201342 = 87,129,124,88,96) appears representative of current regime, so I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand and variability from the most recent regime. This balances service (accounting for longer LT) against holding cost by sizing forecasts to recent realized demand rather than older sparse periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. History shows multiple concluded arrivals implying actual lead time \u22653 (confirmed earlier: orders placed P1 arrived in P4 => LT=3). To ensure pipeline covers the longer realized delay, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available demand samples, keeping forecasts and uncertainty scaled for the longer review+lead window. This balances higher required pipeline against holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P13->P16, P20->P23), confirming actual lead time \u22483 and many earlier promised-2 orders effectively arriving after 3. To ensure pipeline coverage and avoid stockouts given observed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this keeps the base-stock calibrated to the full sample history while the explicit L accounts for delayed/lost shipments.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical arrivals show variable lead-times (observed: 1,2,3 periods with many 3s earlier and recent 1-2s). To capture realized variability I request the backend compute the average observed lead time. Use default demand sizing (backend (1+L)*mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR engine uses full history for base-stock and cap calculations.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time \u22483 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P13\u2192P16, P20\u2192P23 examples). To reflect realized lead time I select L.method="calculate" (average of observed lead times). Use mu_hat.method="default" and sigma_hat.method="default" so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while the longer inferred L ensures pipeline covers extra lead-time risk. With profit=holding, target service quantile is 0.5 so default aggregation is appropriate to avoid excessive holding given the high in-transit volume.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. History shows frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3) plus occasional 1-2 period arrivals; several lost/delayed shipments earlier increased in-transit. To capture the realized longer lead times I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand recently has moderated vs earlier spikes; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last 5 demand observations (Periods 43-47 mean ~87.6) so base_stock reflects current level while accounting for estimated lead time. This balances service (reduce stockouts given longer effective lead time) against holding cost by using recent demand and lead-time evidence rather than longer historical averages.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (many 3-periods, several 1-2s) and some lost/delayed shipments earlier. Pipeline is large but arrival timing is uncertain. I set L to 'calculate' (use average of observed lead times) to let backend infer the empiric lead time from concluded history. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given uncertain lead-time evidence and large existing pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical conclude messages show multiple arrivals with lead_time=3 (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P13->P16, P20->P23) confirming actual lead time >=3. To prevent underordering given observed LT=3 and a large pipeline, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimators so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This avoids overreacting to short noisy gaps while letting the OR engine cap orders against expected demand given the long lead time and existing in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order placed P1 arrived in Period_4; multiple additional P->P+3 arrivals observed: P4->P7, P9->P12, P13->P16, P20->P23).
