Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples mean=93.8, std\u224815.07. No evidence of lead-time or demand regime change. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, balancing service level (profit/holding tradeoff) with limited info.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=122 (order placed P1 not yet concluded; within promised lead time). Historical demand samples mean=93.8, std\u224815.06. No concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time yet and no sustained demand/regime change detected. Use promised lead time and population-based demand moments so backend builds base-stock covering review+lead (1+L) periods: this balances high unit profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by targeting service via full-sample mean/variance.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=245 (matches orders 122+123). Two consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 for orders placed in P1 and P2 \u2014 suggestive of delay but not yet a confirmed lead-time change (needs \u22653 periods). Use promised lead time (default) so backend assumes L=2. Demand history (period samples provided) will be used by backend: choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (use all data) while avoiding premature adjustments for possible temporary shipment delays.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: on-hand=0, in-transit=325 (orders from P1-P3). No concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed; shipments may be delayed but not yet proven lost. Use promised lead time (default L=2). Historical demand samples (95,113,106,84,71) show mean=93.8; using default mu_hat formula (1+L)*mean => captures expected demand over review+lead period. Use default sigma_hat to reflect observed variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These conservative defaults let the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) without prematurely assuming lead-time changes based on unconfirmed delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1438.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent demand samples (95,113,106,84,71) show no sustained regime shift. History shows mixed actual lead times in concluded arrivals (one order with lead_time=3 from P1, one with lead_time=1 from P3) so no clear persistent change; average observed lead time = 2. On-hand=120 and in-transit=155; arrivals have occurred recently (no evidence of lost shipments), so use inferred average lead time to let backend size pipeline. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (to capture the mixed evidence), and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2100.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start: on-hand=9, in-transit=288. Historical demand samples mean=93.8 (periods 1-5). Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed 3 and 1), so use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative base-stock that balances high profit ($19) against holding cost ($1) given large pipeline inventory and recent demand ~94 units/period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=422, recent demands = [95,113,106,84,71]. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times: one order (P1\u2192P4) had lead_time=3 and one (P3\u2192P4) had lead_time=1. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures variability). Demand parameters use 'default' so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR engine compute appropriate base-stock while accounting for the inferred lead time. This balances service (using observed longer lead) against holding cost given high profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $608.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent demand has jumped (Period_5-7 = 111,167,135) versus earlier sample mean (~93.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=477 (large pipeline arriving in future). Observed lead times in concluded history = {3,1,3} (orders from P1->P4, P3->P4, P4->P7), so I let the backend compute the average observed lead time. To capture the recent sustained higher demand (3 periods), I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent N=3 periods so the base-stock reflects the new regime while leveraging the pipeline to avoid over-ordering. This balances higher service level needs from increased demand against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period_5: avg demand increased from 93.8 (Periods_1-4 baseline) to 137.7 (Periods_5-7) (+47%).

Daily Profit: $2432.00, Daily Holding Cost: $92.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2340.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent realized demand is elevated since Period_5 (sustained higher regime). On-hand=92, in-transit=424 \u2192 large pipeline but observed shipments have variable lead times (1\u20133). Observed lead times = [3,1,3,3,1], so I let L be data-driven. For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 5\u20138) to avoid understocking: use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (samples: P5=111, P6=167, P7=135, P8=128) so the backend sizes base-stock to cover the higher mean and measured volatility. Using calculate for L (avg observed lead time) instructs the OR engine to plan for the longer effective lead time seen in concludes, reducing stockouts while the recent_N demand choice limits excess holding given large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1861.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 start: on-hand=153, in-transit=360. Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times (observed sequence by conclusion: 3,1,3,3,1,1) and a confirmed demand regime shift at Period_5 (higher demand thereafter). To balance service and holding cost I estimate lead time from recent observations (smooth last 5 concluded lead times) and use a demand forecast focused on the recent high-demand regime (last 3 demand periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the post-shift behavior. These choices keep target stock responsive to the elevated demand while limiting overstock from older low-demand samples and partially hedging delayed/lost shipments by using a slightly longer recent L estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2127.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: recent history shows mixed lead times (observed W values = 3,1,3,3,1,1 \u2192 average 2). On-hand=39, in-transit=360 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals have varied delays; no sustained new regime since prior carry-over. I set L=calculate to let backend use the observed average lead time. Demand history samples (Periods_1-5 given earlier and later demands) show no new sustained demand shift beyond the prior recorded insight, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service (captures observed lead-time risk via L) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: recent demand has been higher since Period_5 (higher regime). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=452 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {3,1,3,3,1,1} -> avg=2, so keep calculated lead time consistent with observations. To reflect sustained higher demand since Period_5, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 5\u201311, 7 samples) so the OR backend targets stock for the elevated demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent demand has been higher than early baseline (confirmed carry-over insight). On-hand=0, in-transit=426 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average used to reflect variable/slightly >2 lead time. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=7, Periods 6\u201312) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (mean \u2248125.6 over those 7 periods) so base stock covers the (1+L) window under current demand. Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=7 to reflect recent demand variance. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat for the new regime) against holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=529. Observed concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 3 periods (recent pattern includes more 3s), overall average \u22482.14. Demand since Period_5 is higher than Period_1-4 (carry-over insight). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set demand forecasts using recent samples (Periods_5-13, N=9). For lead time I use a recent average of the last 5 observed lead times to give more weight to recent 3-period occurrences while not overreacting to single short arrivals. Volatility is estimated from the same recent demand window (N=9) so the OR backend raises base-stock to cover elevated mean and observed variability. This balances higher service level needs (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but possible delayed arrivals) versus holding cost by relying on recent data rather than all-history smoothing.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=437. History shows multiple concluded arrivals implying actual lead time = 3 periods (orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14). Demand recently elevated vs early baseline; use recent demand to capture current regime. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations, balancing service with holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4; P4->P7; P5->P8; P9->P12; P11->P14).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_16. On-hand=0, in-transit=405. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). Demand regime increased starting Period_5 (Periods_5-7 mean ~137.7) \u2014 use recent demand to capture higher run-rate. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time so OR orders cover longer pipeline. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=3) to base forecast/volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods_5-7), allowing the backend base-stock to target service without excess holding cost.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. On-hand=65, in-transit=302. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations). Demand has shown a past regime shift but recent history is mixed; use confirmed lead time to size the review+lead period. Chosen L explicit=3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid underordering; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

On-hand=3, in-transit=438 (large pipeline) so avoid inflating forecast. Set L explicitly to confirmed 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent regime (last 5 demands) and to reflect current lower demand and volatility, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service given large pipeline.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19. On-hand=0, in-transit=438 (large pipeline). Historical demand recent trend: Periods_14-18 = [106,81,38,62,36] showing a clear drop starting Period_16. I set L explicitly to 3 because lead time has been repeatedly observed as 3 in concluded messages. To avoid excess holding cost given the large pipeline and recent lower demand, I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent low-demand regime). This lowers target base stock and reduces risk of costly overstock while still covering near-term demand and pipeline uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period_16: avg demand fell from 85.0 (Periods_13-15) to 45.3 (Periods_16-18), \u221246.8%.

Period 20. Recent demand regime: sustained low demand since Period 16 (Periods 16-18 avg 45.3, Period 19 demand=25). On-hand=0, in-transit=438 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 (many P->P+3 arrivals). Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid under-ordering. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to base (1+L)-period forecast on the recent low-demand regime (captures Periods 17-19 behavior). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent low-volatility regime. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the low-demand regime while accounting for the confirmed longer lead time and large existing pipeline, balancing service vs. holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). I set L explicit=3 to match observed lead time so the OR engine forecasts over the correct replenishment horizon. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the low-demand regime (1+L=4 review+lead window). Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned with the depressed demand while accounting for pipeline; with large in-transit inventory I avoid inflating long-run targets.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 22: recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 16 (periods 16-21 demands: 38,62,36,25,58,59; avg ~46). On-hand=0, in-transit=438 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages consistently show 3-period actual lead times (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). I set L to calculate so backend uses observed lead times (reflects confirmed LT=3). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (the sustained low-demand regime from P16\u2013P21) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 6 samples), which avoids overordering against older high-demand periods. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect lower volatility in the recent regime. These choices reduce target base stock and cap orders, lowering holding cost while matching current lower demand and accounting for the confirmed longer lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23: recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 16 (avg ~45.3) per carry-over. On-hand=0, in-transit=438 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times (multiple concludes) average \u22482.4 with many 3s \u2014 I let the backend compute the average lead time from observed concludes. Because a sustained demand drop began at Period 16 (7 periods: 16\u201322), I use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts/volatility reflect the low-demand regime and avoid overordering given large in-transit. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of current lower demand) against holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=0, in-transit=438. Historical concludes show confirmed longer lead times (multiple observed 3-period arrivals) and a sustained demand drop starting Period 16 (carry-over). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time data (reflects confirmed 3-period reality). Demand forecast uses recent data after the regime shift: I choose recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower, more stable demand since Period 16 (periods 16\u201323 mean \u224850.9). This reduces target base-stock vs. earlier high-demand regime and prevents excessive holding given large in-transit inventory; using recent samples also tightens volatility estimate to lower safety stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=438. Historical concludes show mixed lead times but overall average > promised, and many past arrivals imply variable LT; large pipeline exists so be conservative on LT estimation. Recent demand (Periods_19-24 = 25,58,59,57,72,93) shows a recovery from the low regime that began at Period_16; I use recent_N=6 to anchor demand forecast to this recovering regime. Set L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the current recovered mean and volatility over the last 6 periods. This balances service (avoid stockouts while pipeline is large) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26. On-hand=0, in-transit=438 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show persistent 3-period arrivals (carry-over). Demand recent history (P17\u2013P26) is lower and variable vs earlier high regime, so I focus forecasting on the most recent 10 periods to capture current mean/volatility. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (reflecting confirmed ~3). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=10 to weight the forecast toward the lower, erratic recent demand and avoid overstock despite large pipeline; this balances service vs holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27. On-hand=0, in-transit=438 (large pipeline from prior periods). Historical conclude messages show frequent actual lead times around 3 but mixed (some 1s); use observed average for L. Demand has a sustained lower regime since Period_16 (noted in carry-over); use recent_N over the entire low-demand regime to forecast (captures reduced mean and volatility). Parameters chosen: L via calculate to reflect observed lead-time mix; mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=11 (Periods_16-26) to align (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility with the low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given high holding cost relative to profit.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. On-hand=0, in-transit=438. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). To ensure pipeline covers demand during the longer lead time I set L explicitly=3. Demand has shown multiple regime shifts; to capture the most recent post-changepoint behavior I use recent_N over the last 12 periods for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on recent data rather than older high-demand bursts. This balances service (with longer confirmed lead time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=438. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period actual lead times (multiple P->P+3 arrivals); recent demand has been low and volatile after the drop at Period 16. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering due to promised 2. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively, which balances service level (covers 4 periods of demand) against holding cost given current high in-transit volume.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: recent demand since Period 16 shows a sustained lower regime (Periods 16-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=451 \u2014 large pipeline exists so we must align forecast to the new low-demand regime to avoid excess holding cost. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 3 periods in history, so set L=3 explicitly. For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 16-29, N=14) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of those 14 recent demands, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of those same 14 samples (recent_N, N=14). This tightens the forecast to current lower demand and lets the OR backend cap ordering given the large in-transit volume, balancing profit-driven service level against holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=451. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P->P+3 observations), so I set L explicit=3 to reflect realized supply delay. Demand dropped at Period_16 and the low-demand regime persists through Period_30; I therefore estimate demand over the review+lead window using the recent regime (Periods_16-30, length 15) to avoid inflating forecasts with earlier higher demand. Selected mu_hat: recent_N N=15 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 15 samples; selected sigma_hat: recent_N N=15 to compute variability from the same recent regime. These parameters align ordering to the confirmed longer lead time and the sustained lower-demand regime, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service given the long pipeline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=451. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed 3-period deliveries (e.g., P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14) so actual lead time has been consistently 3. Recent sustained demand regime drop since Period_16 (lower mean). To reflect true lead-time behavior use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods_16-31, regime_length=16) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower recent demand and its variability; this keeps base-stock conservative given large pipeline and long lead time.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=451. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). Recent demand has been lower since the confirmed drop at Period_16; the most recent regime (Periods_16-32) is 17 periods long. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time (promised=2 but concludes show 3). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (will compute mu_hat as (1+L)*mean of last 17 samples). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=17 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the backend base-stock calculation to the confirmed longer lead time and the persistent lower-demand regime, avoiding overstocking while maintaining service with appropriate safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 34: on-hand=0, in-transit=451. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 3 (multiple P->P+3 arrivals), so use explicit L=3 to reflect realized delays and avoid under-ordering. Recent demand (Periods 19-33) averages around mid-50s; no new sustained regime shift detected. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across samples) so OR engine balances service vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and available demand history.

Pipeline of 451 materially covers several review+lead periods of demand. I set L via calculate so backend uses observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=3). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all samples) because no new sustained demand regime change is evident in recent periods that would justify a selective recent_N or EWMA; defaults provide stable (1+L)-horizon demand estimates and let the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given the large in-transit buffer.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Historical concludes show actual lead time has been 3 periods repeatedly (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P11->P14). Current on-hand=0 with large in-transit=451 (these will arrive according to actual lead time pattern). Demand since Period_29\u201335 averages ~58 units \u2014 recent steady lower-regime around this level. To reflect confirmed longer lead time and recent demand regime, I set L explicitly to 3, use a recent-N mean for mu_hat to capture the current demand level (N chosen to cover the last 7 periods 29\u201335), and mirror that recent window for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward covering (1+L) periods of the current lower demand while accounting for confirmed longer arrivals, reducing risk of overstock from outdated higher-demand estimates.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=451. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 periods repeatedly; recent demand jumped in Periods_36-38 (108,149,130). With L=3, review+lead horizon = 1+L = 4 periods; current pipeline (451) should cover several periods of elevated demand but we must size forecast to recent high regime. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to target the new high-demand regime (Periods_36-38), so the OR backend will compute base_stock and cap using the elevated mean and volatility from these three most recent high-demand observations, balancing service level against $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period_36: avg increased from 51.0 (Periods_33-35) to 129.0 (Periods_36-38), +152.9%.

To reflect observed lead time and the recent high-demand regime I set L explicit=3 so the OR backend accounts for the longer arrival delay. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 (Periods_36-39) to target the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 4), ensuring orders cover the longer lead+review window while keeping safety stock responsive to the recent volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: recent concluded history shows actual lead times dominated by 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals) though occasional 1-period arrivals occurred; on-hand=0, in-transit=516 (large pipeline). Demand history samples available (Periods_1-35 list plus spikes Periods_36-40). I choose L=calculate to let backend estimate average observed lead time (captures the confirmed 3-period behavior). For demand forecast I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples \u2014 this leverages full history while the calculated L inflates the review+lead horizon appropriately. Given large in-transit inventory, this conservative approach avoids overreacting to recent spikes while accounting for the longer realized lead time.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: recent demand has shifted up sharply since Period_36 (periods 36-41 avg\u2248147 units). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=516 units (covers multiple periods). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show many 3-period lead times; carry-over evidence confirms lead time=3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (periods 36-41) so mu_hat targets the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices align base-stock to current high demand while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and the substantial pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent demand has been in a high regime since Period_36 (recent demands: P36-42 = 108,149,130,172,186,137,125; avg\u2248143.9). On-hand=0, in-transit=682 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 in prior periods. I therefore (1) ask backend to calculate L from observed lead times to capture confirmed 3-period reality (method=calculate); (2) set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to anchor the (1+L)-period forecast on the high-demand regime (captures Period_36-42 average); (3) set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher base stock to meet current high demand) while leveraging large in-transit to avoid excessive additional ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1235.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. Recent history shows mixed arrivals with observed lead times of 1 and 3 periods (multiple 3-period confirmations including latest conclude P43: ordered P40 arrived P43). On-hand=0, in-transit=617 (large pipeline). To be conservative on replenishment timing, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend infers the prevailing mix. Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine caps orders based on its historical demand stats while respecting the computed lead time. This balances service (covering multi-period demand given uncertain lead time) against holding cost given the sizeable in-transit inventory.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=617. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained actual lead time = 3 (multiple P->P+3 observations). Recent demand (Periods 36-44) is the high regime (108,149,130,172,186,137,125,132,154). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time; mu_hat recent_N with N=9 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean using the 9 most recent high-regime samples; sigma_hat recent_N with N=9 to capture recent volatility. This ensures pipeline targets cover the longer true lead time and the elevated demand while keeping variability-driven safety stock aligned to the recent regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1434.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: recent history shows sustained actual lead times = 3 periods (multiple concluded orders P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P12->P15, P13->P16, P40->P43, P42->P45). Demand has been elevated since Period_36 with variability (large spikes around P36-P41 then mixed P42-P45). Current on-hand=86 and in-transit=489 (total pipeline+on-hand=575) \u2014 ample cover vs. expected demand; no recent missing shipments beyond established 3-period pattern. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled for (1+L). This keeps orders conservative given large pipeline while letting backend balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand=0, in-transit=489. Historical conclude messages show a persistent lead time of 3 periods (many P->P+3 arrivals). Recent demand regime jumped starting Period 36 (sustained high demands through Period 46). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 36-46, 11 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and volatility, helping the OR backend raise base-stock to meet high demand while keeping holding cost in check.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: recent history shows actual lead time = 3 repeatedly (many concluded arrivals with W=3). On-hand=0 but in-transit=638 units \u2014 large pipeline. Demand since Period_36 is in a higher regime (sustained spike). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend will infer the confirmed longer lead time (\u22483). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (periods 36\u201347 regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime and recent volatility; this keeps base-stock high to utilize the large in-transit shipment while avoiding understock given the longer observed lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 49: on-hand=0, in-transit=638. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods. Given large pipeline and recent high demand episodes, I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed arrivals. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) so the backend sizes base-stock for current elevated demand; sigma_hat left as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service against holding cost given a long confirmed lead time and substantial pipeline.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=638. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period actual lead times (multiple P->P+3 arrivals) and some 1-periods; use backend 'calculate' to let observed lead times determine L. Recent demand (Periods 45-49 = 80,97,140,152,140) is the best indicator of current regime (elevated mean ~122), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current mean/volatility over the review+lead window. This balances higher service needs from recent high demand while the calculated L accounts for observed delayed arrivals; using recent_N for sigma reduces overreaction to older low-demand periods.
