  "rationale": "Inference: Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (orders on P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P40\u2192P43, P41\u2192P44). With observed lead time L=3 we must cover (L+1)=4 future periods of demand when deciding. Inventory check: on-hand=0, in-transit=584 units. Recent demand (Periods 36\u201349) averages \u2248136 units/period \u2192 4-period demand \u2248544 units. Since pipeline (584) > 4-period requirement (\u2248544) we do not need additional stock now; placing no order avoids extra holding cost.
