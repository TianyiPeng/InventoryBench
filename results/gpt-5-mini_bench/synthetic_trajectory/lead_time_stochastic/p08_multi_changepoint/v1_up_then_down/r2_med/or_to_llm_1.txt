Carry-over notes flag an unreliable pipeline since P24 with many P19\u2013P23+ orders not concluding. 2) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=2053 (large), but many past in-transit shipments were delayed or lost; treat pipeline as potentially unavailable short-term. 3) Horizon & timing: Current period is 48 of 50. An order placed now with promised L=2 would at best arrive during Period 50 (after demand in Period 48\u201349 will still occur) and be visible only after horizon; if actual lead time >=3 it will arrive beyond the game horizon. 4) Demand & OR: Recent realized demand has been moderate (50\u201375 in most recent periods when stocked), but OR recommends 0 based on its capped base-stock. 5) Decision: Do not order (0 units).

Step 2 \u2014 Timing to impact remaining horizon: We are at Period 49 of 50. Any order placed now (promised L=2) would arrive during Period 51 (after both remaining selling periods) and thus cannot satisfy demand in Periods 49 or 50. Step 3 \u2014 Demand & OR baseline: OR recommends 0 (uses historical demand and promised lead time). Even if we treated in-transit as unavailable, placing an order now yields no sales before horizon end and only creates holding cost if horizon extended. Step 4 \u2014 Decision: place 0 units. This avoids unnecessary holding cost and aligns with OR; we will rely on any concluded arrivals from existing in-transit (observed only via future conclude messages) rather than place new orders that cannot arrive in time.",
