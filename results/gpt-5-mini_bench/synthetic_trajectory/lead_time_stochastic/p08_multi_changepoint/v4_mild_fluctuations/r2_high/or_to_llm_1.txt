{
  "rationale": "History and concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (recorded in carry-over). Recent sustained demand regime (Periods 24\u201330 avg \u2248121.3) persists through Period 49 demands. Using observed lead time L=3, we must cover (L+1)=4 future periods of demand at current regime: 4 \xd7 121.3 \u2248 485 units. Current inventory position: on-hand 0 + in-transit 490 = 490 units, which already covers \u22484.03 periods of expected demand. Ordering additional units would raise holding cost while providing little marginal stockout protection (we already meet the L+1 cover target). OR recommended 0 (using promised L and historical data); given observed longer lead time and elevated demand, the correct conservative action is still to order 0 because pipeline + on-hand \u2248490 \u2265 required \u2248485. Therefore place no order this period. Monitor forthcoming conclude messages to detect lost shipments or depletion; if in-transit arrivals do not materialize (lost shipments) or demand increases further, place orders in the next period to rebuild pipeline to \u22654 periods of demand.",
