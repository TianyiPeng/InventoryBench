{
  "rationale": "Observed actual lead time = 3 (confirmed P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P21\u2192P23, P26\u2192P28), so we must cover (L+1)=4 future periods of demand when ordering. Recent sustained demand regime (Periods 19\u201325) averaged \u2248130, while subsequent periods (26\u201349) mostly range 90\u2013120; using a conservative single-period demand estimate \u2248115 \u2192 4-period demand \u2248460 units. Current pipeline (in-transit=520) already exceeds the 4-period requirement, and on-hand=0 will be replenished by in-transit arrivals. Ordering more would only increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) with little benefit given sufficient pipeline. Therefore follow a zero-order this period.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order: in-transit 520 exceeds 4-period coverage (~115\xd74=460) given confirmed lead time=3, so additional units would raise holding costs unnecessarily.",
