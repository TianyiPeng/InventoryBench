Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals observed; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean=85.8 (samples: 84,55,79,85,126). Promised lead time=2 and no evidence to change it. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility scaling so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level with holding cost given limited information and no confirmed regime shift.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=128, recent observed conclude shows P1 order not arrived (expected given promised L=2). No concluded arrivals yet to infer a lead-time change. Use promised lead time and historical demand samples (mean=85.8) to let OR backend compute base-stock. Chosen methods are conservative: L default to promised 2; mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect 3-period demand; sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect aggregated variability. This balances service level given high profit versus low holding cost and accounts for in-transit pipeline when backend orders.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=255 (orders placed earlier not yet concluded). Historical concluded messages show no confirmed arrivals but this is expected given promised lead time=2 (orders placed in P1/P2 would arrive during P3/P4 and be visible later). No sustained lead-time or demand regime change detected. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine applies its (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations based on the provided historical samples. This keeps the policy aligned with backend assumptions while the pipeline arrival confirmations are still pending.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Recent demands (periods 1-3): 98, 62, 68 (mean=76). On-hand=0, in-transit=320. Promised lead time=2. All three past orders (from P1\u2013P3) have not concluded (arrived=0), indicating delayed or lost shipments, but evidence is still limited so I retain the promised-lead-time assumption for the OR engine. Using default methods: L=default (use promised 2), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples \u2192 3\xd776), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). With in-transit=320 > default mu_hat (~228) we avoid placing extra inventory to limit holding cost while covering the review+lead demand estimate.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments observed: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not arrived by their expected conclude messages (possible lead-time >2 or lost shipments).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1727.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: recent demands = [84,55,79,85,126] (mean=85.8). On-hand=97, in-transit=127 (pipeline=224). Concluded arrivals show one order (P1) had lead_time=3 and one (P3) had lead_time=1; P2 still missing. Evidence is mixed, so I use observed lead times to estimate L rather than assume a persistent change. Set L via 'calculate' (average of observed lead times = (3+1)/2 =2). With L=2 I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost while letting the OR engine see the standard demand estimate and adjust orders given the promised lead time and caps. This choice is conservative given missing/delayed shipments but lacks 3+ periods of consistent lead-time change required to record a sustained shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1583.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6. Recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show mean demand ~85.8 (samples: 84,55,79,85,126) with latest two periods demand 96 and 84 around that mean. On-hand=13, in-transit=247 \u2014 several earlier orders were delayed but some arrivals in Period_4 confirm actual lead times differing from promised. Use L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (we have observed W=3 for P1->P4 and W=1 for P3->P4), so backend will compute an empirical average. Use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging the full history for stable demand estimate while the calculated L reflects observed delivery variability. This balances service (accounting for longer/variable lead times) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and modest on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability observed: instances of 3 and 1 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period4 -> W=3; Period3 order arrived Period4 -> W=1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $247.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent history shows variable actual lead times (observed W=3 for P1->P4 and W=1 for P3->P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=365 (sufficient to cover forecasted (1+L) demand). I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use average observed lead times. Demand forecast uses 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to leverage full sample set (samples mean=85.8) and keep planning stable given limited, noisy lead-time signals. Volatility uses 'default' to scale sample std by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service level (protect vs. lead-time variability) while avoiding excess holding since in-transit inventory is already large.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20137 = [84,55,79,85,126,56,85]) show average \u224881.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=394 (large pipeline with some past delayed arrivals: observed lead times include 3 and 1). There is evidence of lead-time variability but only two concluded lead-time observations, so use backend calculation to estimate average lead time. Use default demand aggregation so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples (robust given limited data). Sigma left to backend default to capture observed volatility. These choices balance service (capture variability via backend-calculated L) vs holding cost (default mu/sigma avoid overreacting to a small apparent spike at Period_5).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 9. On-hand=34, in-transit=245. Historical concluded lead times show variability: observed W={3,1,3,1} (orders: P1->P4, P3->P4, P5->P8, P7->P8). Average observed lead time ~2. Demand history shows no sustained >3-period regime shift; recent demand is variable but not persistently elevated. Reconciliation: in-transit plus on-hand covers multiple periods of demand; some earlier shipments were delayed but later concluded, so I treat lead time empirically. Decisions: set L by 'calculate' (use observed average lead time) so backend learns realized lead-time statistics; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), avoiding overreaction to short-run variability. This balances service (using observed lead-time avg) vs holding cost (default demand estimates avoid overshooting due to recent spikes).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=10. On-hand=0, in-transit=365 units; recent concludes show mixed lead times (observed W={3,1,3,1}, avg=2) and demand history samples mean= (84+55+79+85+126)/5 = 85.8. Pipeline (365) already covers multiple periods of demand; no clear sustained demand regime shift. Use calculate for L to reflect observed average lead time=2, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This balances service level (accounting for lead-time variability) while avoiding extra stock given large in-transit volume.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=405. Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times (observed W={3,1,3,1}) indicating high lead-time variability and some delayed arrivals; no sustained shift to a new single lead time. Demand history (recent periods 6\u201310 = 56,85,115,88,39) is volatile; last 5 periods better reflect current regime than the older 5-sample prior. I choose L using recent observed lead times to capture variability (average of recent 4 observed Ws). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=5 to emphasize the latest demand regime and limit dilution from older samples. These settings hedge against overdue shipments by sizing base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand while reflecting current variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has varied but average matches promised; many shipments delayed earlier but recent pattern symmetric. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so forecasts reflect full sample history and incorporate the chosen L; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding overreacting to short-lived fluctuations given some shipments may be delayed or lost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 13. On-hand=83, in-transit=245. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) = [3,1,3,1,3,2] (avg \u22482.17) indicating persistent lead-time variability skewed above the promised 2. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time rather than the promised value. Demand forecast and uncertainty use default methods so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) using the full historical samples; this balances service level (captures longer/variable lead time) against holding cost without overfitting to short recent swings. No new sustained demand regime or confirmed lost-shipment pattern that meets the 3+ period threshold.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed W = 3,1,3,1,3,2 \u2192 avg \u22482.17). On-hand=0, in-transit=311 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals are delayed/variable). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average (captures the 1\u20133 period variability). For demand forecast I use mu_hat='default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) because historical samples (84,55,79,85,126; mean\u224885.8) show no clear sustained regime change and default pools all data for stability. Volatility set to sigma_hat='default' to reflect full-sample variability scaled by \u221a(1+L). These settings balance service level (accounting for longer average lead time) against holding cost given large pipeline in-transit.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times = [3,1,3,1,3,2] (avg \u22482.17), so I set L to recent_N over the last 6 observed lead times to reflect this higher-than-promised and variable lead time. Demand has risen in the most recent periods (Period_10..Period_14 demands = [39,76,77,94,95]); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize recent demand regime and variance, and to ensure the OR base-stock covers the (1+L) review+lead horizon given elevated recent demand. This balances service level (capture recent demand spike) against holding cost by letting the backend compute safety stock from recent mean and volatility.

On-hand=0, in-transit=396 (large pipeline) which should cover several periods of demand. I choose L by 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2014 this balances service (accounting for longer observed lead time) against holding cost given the large in-transit stock and limited recent sample size.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: recent concluded history shows variable lead times with multiple 3-period arrivals; on-hand=0, in-transit=330. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized variability (promised=2 but several 3s observed). Demand history (samples: 84,55,79,85,126) is limited but no clear sustained demand regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances higher effective lead time (protecting service level) against holding cost given large in-transit stock and observed delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed frequently as 3 periods: observed P1->P4 (W=3), P5->P8 (W=3), P9->P12 (W=3), P13->P16 (W=3); variability also includes 1 and 2 period instances.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 3-period arrivals (several P->P+3) with some 1\u20132 period cases; recent pattern supports using observed average lead time. Pipeline (326) is substantial but arrival confirmations lag one period. Choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (~2.375) so ordering accounts for occasional 3-period delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) since demand samples are limited and no confirmed sustained demand regime shift; this balances service level vs holding cost given high profit relative to holding cost.

Historical concluded lead times show variability with multiple 3-period observations and occasional 1\u20132 periods; average observed lead time best summarizes evidence. Recent demand (Periods 14\u201318 = 95,55,133,95,95) shows a higher, more variable regime\u2014use recent 5-sample estimates for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets service for the new regime while respecting observed lead-time behavior and existing in-transit stock.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

Date Period_20. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16) with some variability; current on-hand=0 and large in-transit=470 (many outstanding orders). Several past shipments arrived with W=3 consistently, so I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples with L=3, which balances service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). This respects overdue/in-transit shipments (no extra upward adjustment) while letting the backend cap orders per its policy.

Demand history shows intermittent spikes (e.g., Period_19 demand=166) but no sustained recent regime shift. Given substantial in-transit stock and evidence of lead-time variability skewed toward 3, use calculated average lead time so backend accounts for observed variability; keep mu_hat/sigma_hat defaults so the OR engine uses all demand samples scaled by (1+L) for forecast and volatility, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: on-hand=0, in-transit=470. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple P->P+3 confirmations) and variable shorter instances; recent arrivals and long stretches of delayed arrivals indicate actual lead time \u22483. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. Recent demand has stepped up (last 5 demands: 95, 95, 166, 115, 109) so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current higher regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean). Demand volatility is elevated (large spike at 166), so I use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability. These choices help the OR backend increase safety stock to cover longer lead time and recent demand surge while bounding over-ordering via the capped policy.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect the sustained and repeatedly observed 3-period lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, preserving sample-based uncertainty while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and keeps pipeline coverage at 4 periods. This balances service (higher coverage given 3-period arrivals) versus holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=5 and large in-transit=470 (many prior orders still en route). Given observed variability but a clear tilt toward 3-period arrivals, I set L using the average of observed lead times to reflect actual behavior while letting the OR engine smooth variability. For demand I use the default aggregation so backend computes (1+L)*mean across all samples; sigma kept default so backend scales historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher safety stock for longer/more-variable lead time against holding cost, and leverages the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple P->P+3 observations) and intermittent 1\u20132 period instances; promised L=2 but evidence supports using L=3 to protect service level. Large in-transit stock exists but arrivals are delayed by lead time; setting L=3 (explicit) tells the OR engine to size review+lead demand for 4 periods. I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat = default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine use full demand history while accounting for the longer lead time. This balances higher service-level (profit>>holding cost) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

To reflect observed lead-time variability I use 'calculate' so backend estimates average observed lead time from concluded history. Recent demand has increased (last 5 demands = 109,97,86,169,167) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current higher-demand regime; this balances higher service level needs against holding cost given limited on-hand stock and substantial pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=622. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple P->P+3 instances) and recent very high demand (Periods 22-26: 97,86,169,167,168). I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect the sustained occurrences of 3-period lead times and overdue arrivals. For demand I use a recent_N=5 window (Periods 22-26) to capture the current high-demand regime; this yields a (1+L)-scaled forecast that protects service level given L=3. Sigma uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts under apparent longer lead time while the OR backend will cap orders to control holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with many 3-period instances (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16) and intermittent 1\u20132 period arrivals; recent pattern supports treating actual lead time > promised. Use L='calculate' so backend computes average observed lead time from concluded history. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so forecasts scale with (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, providing higher coverage given observed longer lead times and large in-transit volume.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: recent demand has been volatile with multiple high-demand periods (several >150) but also many low periods; on-hand=75, in-transit=537 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times with recent observations weighted toward 3 but including 1\u20132 instances. I choose L=recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent lead-time behavior (balances occasional 3-period arrivals vs some 1\u20132). Leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples, letting backend leverage full history given demand volatility and large pipeline. This keeps service level responsive while avoiding excess holding given holding cost $1 and profit $19.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=33, in-transit=470; recent concluded lead times show mix of 1\u20133 with recent tendency toward 2 (last observed: 2,2,1,3,3). Pipeline is large, so aggressive service focus is justified. I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times to capture current variability (recent_N). Demand has shifted higher in later periods (Periods 25\u201329: 167,168,111,77,109), so I use recent demand statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat (recent_N with N=5) to reflect the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base_stock to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=489. Historical concludes show variable lead times with a recent tilt toward 2\u20133 periods. Recent observed lead times (most recent 5) average ~2.2, so I use recent_N to capture current effective lead-time. Demand has been elevated recently; I base mu_hat on the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 26\u201330) to reflect the current regime. Volatility likewise uses the most recent 5 samples. These choices help the OR backend size the base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand using recent demand and lead-time behavior while adapting to recent variability and addressing past delayed shipments.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32. On-hand=0, in-transit=489. Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133) with a recent central tendency >2 (avg \u22482.18 across observed arrivals), and demand has shifted higher and more volatile since ~Period_19. Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed lead-time mix; use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast across the (1+L) review+lead horizon using the most recent high-demand regime (Periods ~19\u201331). This balances higher service-level needs from elevated demand while keeping volatility estimate tied to the same recent window; it also accounts for delayed arrivals already in-transit rather than assuming promised L=2.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=572. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple P->P+3 observations since Period 17) alongside occasional 1\u20132 period instances and some lost/delayed arrivals earlier. Therefore I infer actual lead time from observed concludes rather than using promised 2. I select L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has recently been elevated and variable (recent demands: P28\u2013P32 = 77,109,104,120,103); to capture the latest regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This biases orders toward covering the longer, often-3 period pipeline and recent higher demand while letting the OR backend apply the service-level cap to limit over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=489. Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133 periods) with many 3-period observations but also frequent 1\u20132. Demand has increased and been volatile in recent periods (multiple demands >100 since Period_24). I set L=calculate so backend uses observed lead times average (captures empirical variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to base mu_hat on the most recent regime (Periods ~24\u201333) where demand appears elevated; sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to size the base stock to cover the current higher demand regime while letting the OR engine account for observed lead-time variability and cap orders to limit overstock given holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35. On-hand=0, in-transit=569. Promised L=2 but history shows mixed lead times with many 3-period arrivals; use observed average lead time (calculate) so OR backend accounts for realized delays. Demand history is volatile; no clear recent sustained demand regime change, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all samples scaled by 1+L) to let backend compute base-stock and cap from full sample statistics.

Historical concluded lead times show variability with many 3-period instances but also 1\u20132; average of observed concluded lead times \u22482.08. Given mixed evidence but a slight tilt above promised 2, set L to calculate (use observed average). Demand history samples are limited; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This leverages the observed lead-time estimate while letting backend compute demand aggregate and volatility; large in-transit reduces urgency to inflate mu_hat now.

I set L using calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history.

I choose to estimate current lead time from the most recent observed lead-time samples to capture recent shortening vs earlier 3-period runs. L set via recent_N (N=5) to average the last 5 observed lead times (captures the recent mix of 1\u20132\u20133 values). Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use default rules so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this leverages the full sample history while letting L reflect recent lead-time behavior. Large in-transit inventory (489) will be considered by the backend pipeline when computing order quantity.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: recent concluded history shows mixed lead times with many 3-period arrivals but also 1\u20132 period instances; computed average of observed concluded lead times \u22482.08, so use calculated average to capture realized variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=489 \u2014 substantial pipeline that the OR should treat against a realistic lead time. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend uses (1+L)*mean_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples, letting the engine compute base-stock with our inferred L to balance high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1). This handles possible delayed arrivals while avoiding excessive extra forecast adjustments given abundant in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=489. Historical concludes show variable lead times with many 3-period occurrences; recent pipeline is large so avoid inflating forecast. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time from concluded history (captures 1\u20133 variability and frequent 3s). For demand I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all provided samples; this keeps the forecast anchored to full-sample statistics while the large in-transit position will prevent excess ordering.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=489. Historical conclude messages show variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20133, many 3s). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the recent mix and frequent 3-period instances). For demand parameters I use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this leverages full-sample demand estimates while the calculated L accounts for delayed/variable arrivals and helps the OR backend size orders to cover (L+1) periods of demand given the observed lead-time variability.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=489. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple P->P+3 confirmations) and variable 1\u20132 instances; missing/delayed shipments occurred earlier. To protect service given observed sustained 3-period arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which balances targeting the OR base-stock using full historical demand while accounting for the longer review+lead period. This leverages the large in-transit pipeline and confirmed longer lead time to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost in backend tradeoff.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=490. Historical concludes show frequent lead-time=3 observations (confirmed repeatedly through Period 17) and intermittent 1\u20132 period instances; recent demand (Periods 39\u201343) averages ~81 units. To respect confirmed longer lead times while letting backend compute precise average, set L via calculate. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to focus on latest regime (reduces overshoot from older high spikes). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices aim to cover (1+L) periods of demand given likely L\u22483 while avoiding excessive holding cost since substantial in-transit inventory already exists.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=490. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16) with occasional 1\u20132 period instances, so actual lead time is longer/variable than promised=2. I choose L=calculate to let backend use average observed lead time. Demand history (samples provided) is stable enough to use default pooling for mu_hat and sigma_hat: default uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, which balances service level and holding cost given the longer inferred lead time and large in-transit volume. This keeps the OR engine conservative on target inventory while capping orders via its internal cap to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. Recent history shows variable but centered lead times (observed W samples: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3,3,1,2,2,1,2,2; avg \u22482.07). On-hand=0, in-transit=489 (large pipeline). To balance service vs holding cost I let the backend compute a modestly above-2 lead-time via observed average (reduce risk from occasional 3-period delays) and use demand statistics across history for forecast/volatility so orders are sized by data while capping replenishment. Methods chosen: infer L from observed lead times (calculate) so pipeline coverage uses measured behavior; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend applies full-sample mean/variance across (1+L) periods given the large in-transit volume.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: on-hand=0, in-transit=489. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple confirmed P1->P4, P5->P8, etc.), and lead-time variability persists. With a large in-transit pipeline, I adopt lead time=3 to reflect the frequently observed actual lead time so the OR engine sizes orders for the longer pipeline. I use default demand/volatility scaling so mu_hat and sigma_hat become (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples, letting the backend compute base_stock and cap based on the full sample set.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand is 0 with 489 units in-transit; historical concluded lead times show high variability (1\u20133) with more recent observations biased toward 2 or lower. To be responsive to recent shorter arrivals while capturing variability, set lead time using recent_N (N=5) averaging the last 5 observed lead times. Leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes demand across (1+L) periods from full-sample mean/std, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1.

Large pipeline (489) likely covers upcoming demand; some past shipments were delayed/lost but recent pattern centers near 2\u20133. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average lead time from concluded history (~2.07). For demand forecasting I use 'default' \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (captures increased lead time) with holding cost given the substantial in-transit inventory.
