{
  "rationale": "History shows large in-transit (985) but many past shipments were delayed/lost and only some orders concluded after 2\u20133 periods. Recent carry-over warns treating in-transit as unreliable unless arrivals are confirmed. Empirical single-period demand from provided samples = 102 units (mean of [137,92,110,43,128]). Given evidence actual lead time has been observed as 3 periods (and deliveries have sometimes taken 3), plan for (L_actual + 1) \u2248 4 periods of demand protection: 102 \xd7 4 = 408 units. On-hand = 0, in-transit is unreliable, so place an order to cover ~4 periods of demand. I do not record any new carry-over insight because existing notes already capture the delayed/lost shipment pattern and lead-time evidence. Final action: order 408 units for chips(Regular).",
