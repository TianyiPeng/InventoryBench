Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded arrivals repeatedly show orders placed on Period t arriving on Period t+3 (examples: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P11\u2192P14, P14\u2192P17, P13\u2192P16, P5\u2192P8). This confirms actual lead time = 3 periods. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 585 units (undelivered). Demand outlook: recent realized demands (Periods 46\u201349) = [55, 0, 111, 83], recent multi-period typical demand ~80\u2013100/day historically; a conservative 4-period (L+1 = 4) demand estimate \u2248 250\u2013400 units. With lead time = 3, orders placed now would not arrive until after 3 periods, so we must rely on pipeline. Pipeline (585) comfortably covers the next (L+1) periods of demand and provides buffer. Holding cost is $1/unit/period while profit is $4/unit; excess inventory reduces objective via holding cost. OR recommends 0 units; OR uses promised L and historical data but cannot see lost shipments\u2014here pipeline is visible and large. Decision: place 0 order to avoid increasing holding cost and because in-transit inventory already exceeds the (L+1)-period demand requirement. Follow-up: monitor upcoming conclude messages to confirm arrivals and detect any lost shipments (if in-transit fails to conclude after expected 3 periods, then amend future orders).",
