Promised L=2 but evidence supports L\u22483 (sustained). Treat actual review+lead horizon as (1+L)=4 periods for safety.\n2) Demand stats (history): sample mean \u03bc\u0304=158 units/period, sample std \u03c3\u0304\u224833.4. OR used promised L=2 producing \u03bc\u0302(3)=474 and \u03c3\u0302(3)\u224857.9. OR recommended 185 units (capped policy).\n3) Inventory posture: on-hand=87, in-transit=134 \u2192 pipeline=221 units, which is well below 3\u20134 period expected demand (single-period mean \u2248158). If actual L\u22483 then 4-period demand \u2248632 units, so pipeline+OR order should move toward that level to avoid stockouts.\n4) Adjustment logic vs OR: OR recommendation (185) assumes L=2 and caps order; because actual lead times have trended to 3 (delays) and we have a history of delayed/lost shipments, we should increase ordering to rebuild pipeline to cover the longer effective lead time. However, avoid extreme overshoot because holding cost is nontrivial ($1/unit/period) and some in-transit may still arrive.\n5) Final action: order 300 units (increasing OR's 185). This raises pipeline to 521 units (221 current + 300 ordered). That is a conservative step toward covering a 3\u20134 period demand horizon (521 vs ~632 target for 4 periods, or vs 474 for 3 periods), while limiting holding cost exposure.\n6) Monitoring plan: watch next conclude messages for arrivals confirming LT=3 or lost shipments; if further arrivals confirm persistent 3-period LT, increase orders further to approach 4-period coverage; if arrivals show shorter LT, scale back.\n7) Risk tradeoffs: ordering 300 reduces near-term stockout risk from delayed LT but increases holding costs relative to OR's lower order; chosen level balances those risks given strong evidence of extended lead times.\n",
