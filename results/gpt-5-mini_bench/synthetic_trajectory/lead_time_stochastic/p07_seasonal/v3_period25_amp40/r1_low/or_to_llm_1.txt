Use historical sample mean from provided demand samples: mean single-period demand \u2248158 (periods 1\u20135: 118,153,211,153,155 \u2192 avg 158).

Pipeline inventory (632) \u2265 \u03bc\u0302 in both plausible L cases, so pipeline alone covers the (L+1)-period expected demand and we should not order. Holding cost equals profit, so safety factor q=0.5 gives no additional safety stock; OR recommended 0 and that is appropriate given ample pipeline.
