There is conflicting signal: long-run sample mean suggests high demand but realized sales so far are low; with holding cost = profit ($1 vs $1) excess inventory is costly. 4) OR baseline: OR recommends 12 units (uses promised L=2 and historical mean). Given we have large pipeline (261) and confirmed longer lead time (3) which increases risk of overstock if we add more, I will refrain from ordering now. 5) Decision logic: Do not order (0 units). This avoids adding to inventory given substantial in-transit stock and equal holding/profit costs; we will re-evaluate after more concluded arrivals/demand to resolve the mean vs realized-sales discrepancy. 6) Monitoring: Watch next conclude messages to verify whether other past orders arrive (to update true pipeline ETAs) and to reassess demand regime before placing replenishment orders.",
