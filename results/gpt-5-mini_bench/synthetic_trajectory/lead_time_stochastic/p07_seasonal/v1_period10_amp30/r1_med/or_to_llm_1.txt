Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Observation & lead-time: Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12). Inventory position: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 496 units (undelivered). Demand context: recent realized demands fluctuate ~40\u2013160; typical single-period demand ~100 (many past periods around 90\u2013140). With L=3, (L+1)=4 periods of demand coverage is needed at decision time. 496 units in-transit comfortably cover ~4+ periods at ~100 units/period, so additional ordering would create unnecessary holding cost given holding=$1/unit/period vs profit=$4/unit. OR recommended 0 units; its cap/stock logic is conservative but here the binding constraint is large confirmed pipeline. Risk of lost shipments: carry-over notes earlier lost P2 order but current large in-transit total is observed; no new sustained anomalies. Decision: place 0 orders to avoid increasing holding cost while awaiting in-transit arrivals. This follows OR recommendation adjusted for actual lead time and current pipeline.",
