Demand regime: We have two concluded periods of observed demand: Period1 demand=115, Period2 demand=109 (avg \u2248112). The provided 'historical samples' list is not confirmed by conclude messages, so rely on concluded demands. Lead time & pipeline: Promised lead time=2. Concluded messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Period1 or Period2; both shipments (327 and 3) remain in-transit (total 330) and may still arrive per promised lead time or be lost \u2014 there is no concluded arrival yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Inventory assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Required coverage: Because demand in recent periods \u2248112, the in-transit 330 already covers roughly 2.9 periods of expected demand (330/112\u22482.95). Given the supplier promise of 2-period lead time (so we should cover L+1=3 periods) and the pipeline already close to that coverage, ordering more now risks excess ending inventory and holding cost ($1/unit/period) without evidence of higher demand or delayed/lost shipments. Risk: If in-transit is lost or lead time extends, we would understock; however, we have no concluded evidence of loss or extended lead time (need 3+ periods of consistent missed arrivals to confirm).
