Promised lead time = 2 (so decisions should cover L+1=3 periods), but there are no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unobserved and could be longer or shipments could be lost. Given (a) limited evidence to contradict OR's cap (no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes), (b) high holding cost relative to profit would penalize over-ordering if OR's cap is already cautious, and (c) OR's cap explicitly reduces order volatility when pipeline is empty, I follow the OR recommendation this period.
