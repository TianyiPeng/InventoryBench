OR-style base-stock (with q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0) would be \u03bc\u0302 = 435.2. Pipeline inventory = 288, so uncapped order_raw = 435.2 \u2212 288 = 147.2. However, OR cap (based on promised L=2) produced a much lower cap; using the original OR cap calculation (for comparison) gave cap \u2248167, so order_raw would still be below that. But holding cost equals profit ($1 each) so overstock is costly; recent realized demand (Periods 12\u201321) averages ~101.7, close to historical mean, so no evidence of a sustained upward shift. Given: (a) some prior shipments were lost (carry-over insight) so part of in-transit may not arrive, (b) high holding cost favors avoiding large buys, and (c) OR's capped recommendation is very conservative (24), while strict base-stock with actual L suggests much larger orders. Compromise: compute OR-style using promised L gave order_raw\u224838 (when using L=2 \u03bc\u0302=326.4 then order_raw=326.4\u2212288=38.4).

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observed actual lead time = 3 (confirmed earlier). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 436. Recent realized demand (Periods 41\u201349) averages roughly 81\u201390 units/period; using conservative single-period demand \u224885 units, (L+1)=4 periods demand \u2248340 units. Pipeline 436 > 340 so current pipeline likely covers next (L+1) periods of demand even with lead_time=3 and some variability. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each) so overstock is costly; OR recommended 0 (using promised L) which is consistent with the reality-adjusted check. Therefore place 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding costs and because existing in-transit inventory suffices to meet near-term demand. I will not record any new carry-over insight (no new sustained patterns).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order: confirmed lead time=3 and in-transit 436 comfortably covers ~4 periods (~340 units) of demand, so ordering risks costly holding without benefit.",
