Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no 'Period X conclude' history to infer actual lead time or demand regime changes. Use promised lead time and default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps parameters grounded in historical data while avoiding premature changepoint claims.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. Promised lead time is 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=180 (ordered P1). P1 order not concluded yet \u2014 consistent with promised L=2 (arrival will be visible after Period_3 conclude). Historical demand samples: [80,120,120,93,177] (mean=118). No sustained evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime change (only one recent conclude). Use default lead time to trust the promise, and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility across all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given current pipeline cover.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=352 which matches ordered 180 (P1) + 172 (P2) => no concluded arrivals yet and no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change. Promised lead time=2 remains best prior. Use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this balances service level vs holding cost given no confirmed regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=434 (orders from P1:180, P2:172, P3:82) and no concluded arrivals yet. Promised L=2 but three consecutive periods produced no arrivals for those orders, so I conservatively extend lead time. I set L explicit=3 to reflect likely longer transit; mu_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent demand regime (demands in P1-3: 106,111,107 => mean=108; (1+L)*mean = 4*108 = 432 forecast across review+lead). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand volatility (use last 3 samples). These choices bias orders toward covering (L+1) periods of near-term demand given overdue shipments while avoiding overreacting to older historical samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >2: orders from Periods 1-3 totaling 434 units remain in-transit with no arrivals by Period_3 conclude (expected if L=2), indicating sustained delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2498.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: recent demand samples = [80,120,120,93,177] (mean=118). On-hand=124, in-transit=179; Period_4 conclude shows mixed lead times (orders from P1 arrived with lead_time=3; P3 arrived with lead_time=1) indicating variability but insufficient sustained evidence to change promised lead time. I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (uses concluded arrivals) so OR adapts to measured variability. For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing conservative coverage for the review+lead period given observed demand and the current pipeline. This balances service (profit >> holding cost) against inventory holding given already substantial on-hand and in-transit stock and uncertain lead-time behavior.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1936.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: on-hand=21, in-transit=342; recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (one order from P1 arrived in P4 with lead_time=3, one from P3 arrived in P4 with lead_time=1) and recent orders (P4,P5) have not yet concluded\u2014indicating variability and possible delays. I set L to recent_N (N=2) to let the backend average the two observed lead times (captures the demonstrated variability without overreacting to a single long delay). For demand I use default (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) because demand shows no sustained regime shift across the available periods. Volatility also uses default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)). These choices balance service (accounting for observed longer lead time) against holding cost, while letting the OR engine compute base-stock and cap using all historical demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $399.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=502. Historical concluded lead times: P1->P4 = 3, P3->P4 = 1 (avg=2). Several earlier shipments were delayed and large pipeline remains; use observed lead-time average to reflect recent variability. Choose L=calculate so backend uses observed average lead time (captures the 3-period delay signal without overcommitting). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast leverages all samples scaled by (1+L) and overall volatility\u2014this balances service level (captures elevated pipeline/delay risk) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=540. History shows multiple delayed arrivals (observed lead times: 3,1,3 \u2192 avg 2.33) and recent late deliveries (orders from earlier periods arrived with L=3). To reflect observed lead-time behavior I set L method to calculate so backend uses the empirical average lead time. Demand history (Periods 1\u20137) is heterogeneous but not a sustained new demand regime; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances raising cover for longer effective lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats; it also avoids overreacting to short-term demand dips/spikes given outstanding in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1672.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=114, in-transit=332. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with multiple 3-period observations (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 3-period tendency). Demand has fallen from earlier spikes; I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (Periods 4-8 demand = 138,103,42,83,94) to focus the forecast on the latest regime. This yields (1+L)\xd7recent mean for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std for sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service given current lower demand while the calculate-L handles observed lead-time drift and reduces risk of under-ordering given large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period4; Period4 order arrived Period7; Period5 order arrived Period8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1826.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=17, in-transit=369 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {3,1,3,3,1} with majority 3; recent confirmations indicate actual lead time longer than promised. I select L via 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures confirmed L\u22482.2 driven by multiple 3-period arrivals). Given the large in-transit volume, I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' to avoid up-weighting demand forecasts and prevent excess ordering; this lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service level (capture longer lead time) against holding cost (avoid over-ordering into existing pipeline).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=504. Historical conclude messages show multiple arrivals consistent with actual lead time = 3 (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8); several earlier orders were delayed beyond promised 2. Given confirmed LT=3, set L explicit to 3 so OR backend sizes the review+lead demand window correctly. Demand history shows no new sustained mean/variance regime beyond previously recorded shifts, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service level (accounting for longer LT) vs holding cost while avoiding over-reacting to recent short blips.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=514. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (Period1\u21924, Period4\u21927, Period5\u21928), confirming actual lead time=3 (promised=2). Several earlier orders were delayed but recent arrivals consistent with L=3; no evidence of new demand regime (recent demands ~40\u2013140). I set L explicitly to 3 to ensure pipeline coverage (order + on-hand + in-transit will be compared against (1+L) demand). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time. This addresses missing/delayed shipments by increasing the review+lead forecast window.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 13: on-hand=88, in-transit=342. Historical concluded lead times show repeated 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) with some 1\u20132 period observations; average observed lead time \u22482.29 but mode and recent pattern = 3. To account for observed variability and persistent delays, set L via 'calculate' (uses average of observed lead times). Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this is conservative given limited sample history and avoids overfitting to short swings. These choices increase the pipeline cover to balance higher effective lead time against holding cost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: recent concluded history shows actual lead times cluster at 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals) with occasional shorter arrivals; demand samples (Periods 1-5: 80,120,120,93,177) average ~118. On-hand=9, in-transit=414 \u2014 large pipeline exists including earlier delayed shipments. I select L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized delivery behavior (method=calculate). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use default formulas so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine incorporate the chosen L and historical demand dispersion. This balances higher safety stock due to longer inferred lead time against holding cost given large existing in-transit inventory.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=477. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple arrivals show L=3) and recurring delayed shipments. To cover demand over review+lead and respond to confirmed longer lead time, I set L explicitly to 3. Demand has recent stable observations (Periods 10-14 = 53,97,84,79,88) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the most recent regime for both forecast and volatility. This increases pipeline coverage against lost/delayed arrivals while keeping variability based on recent demand to avoid excessive holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period lead times (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14), so I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. Use mu_hat default to let OR compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) (captures demand over review+lead horizon). Use sigma_hat default so backend scales volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher safety stock for longer confirmed lead time against holding cost while accounting for existing in-transit supply; flagged in-transit volume (477) should be considered by the OR engine when sizing new orders.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=414. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=3). Demand recent history (Periods 4\u201316) centers around ~80\u2013132 with occasional spikes. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend will infer the confirmed ~3-period lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a conservative base-stock that accounts for the longer lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=411. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=3 across recent periods), signaling actual lead time is 3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and avoid underordering. Demand has risen recently (last 5 demands: P13-17 = 79,88,78,132,132; mean=101.8), so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime: backend will compute (1+L)*mean over last 5 samples. I also use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices align base-stock to the 4-period demand horizon and raise safety stock to protect service while limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=499. Historical concluded arrivals show many 3-period lead times (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) with occasional 1\u20132 period outliers, and recent pattern indicates sustained longer transit. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend will infer the empiric average (captures the dominant 3-period reality). I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this balances service level given elevated lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise. This choice helps the OR engine raise base stock to cover the longer effective pipeline without me over-specifying demand forecasts.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=499. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., Period1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P10\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Given sustained 3-period arrivals and large in-transit volume, set lead time explicitly to 3 so OR backend plans for (1+L) review+lead demand. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the capped ordering rule balance profit vs holding cost under the confirmed longer lead time.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=0, in-transit=499; recent demands show frequent stockouts and a large spike (Period_20 demand=186). Multiple concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time frequently \u22483 (several orders with lead_time=3). Given delayed arrivals and huge pipeline, set L to calculate (use observed lead times average) so backend internal (1+L) scaling is aligned with realized delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine incorporate the calculated L and full historical demand variability. This balances service level (accounts for longer observed lead time) against holding costs given large in-transit inventory.

Period 22. Recent demand has shifted higher (last 5 periods demand ~132 avg driven by P20=186, P21=167). On-hand=0, in-transit=522 (large pipeline; many long-delayed arrivals historically). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods. To protect service given confirmed L=3 and elevated recent demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime (balances service vs holding cost given large pipeline).

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=679. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmations). Recent demand (Periods 18-22 = 81,105,186,167,120) is higher than early-sample mean, indicating a sustained upward regime. To reflect confirmed lead-time delays I set L explicit=3 so the OR knows arrivals take 3 periods. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (captures spike around Periods 20-21). This increases target base-stock to improve service given long lead times while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability; large in-transit volume is noted but may arrive with delay, so parameters bias toward higher replenishment to avoid stockouts.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_24. On-hand=47, in-transit=499. Historical conclude messages show many arrivals with lead times > promised 2 (multiple observed 3-period arrivals; computed average observed lead time \u22482.17). Several earlier shipments were delayed or lost before arrivals, so use an inferred average lead time rather than the promised value. I select L by 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times. Demand forecast and uncertainty will use the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service (covering the longer effective pipeline) while keeping volatility and holding cost tradeoffs handled by the OR engine's base-stock formula.

Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead times often =3 (several P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures realized >2 lead time). Using default for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the available demand samples, which balances service level (higher L increases required pipeline cover) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=537. Historical concluded arrivals show variable but persistently >2 occasionally (multiple 3-period observations) and recent mix of 1\u20133. I set L via "calculate" to let backend use the average of all observed lead times (captures sustained delay signal without overreacting to short recent arrivals). For demand I use "default" so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) (uses full-sample mean 118) and sigma_hat "default" so volatility = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (higher L increases pipeline coverage given delayed arrivals) against holding cost using full-sample demand stats rather than short noisy windows.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=542. Historical conclude messages show multiple lead_time=3 observations (orders from P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) and some variability; many earlier shipments were delayed beyond promised L=2, so infer actual lead time from observed data. Several long outstanding in-transit batches exist (total in-transit 542) so do not assume same-period arrivals. Set L using 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) to capture realized delays. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, letting the OR engine balance service vs holding cost given the inferred lead time and observed demand history.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=542. Historical concluded arrivals show many 3-period lead times (several 3s, some 1s and 2s); average observed lead time >2. Use 'calculate' for L so backend uses the empirical average lead time. Keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend computes demand across review+lead using all samples (conservative pooling) given uncertain lead-time variability and large in-transit volume.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=537. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) and some shorter arrivals; recent arrivals include a 2-period (P26->P28). Because concluded lead-time observations are mixed and the OR backend expects an averaged lead-time estimate, I select 'calculate' to let backend compute average from all observed lead times. Demand history shows no clear sustained regime change beyond the provided samples, so I use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend's base-stock formula and cap operate with the averaged lead time and population demand stats. This balances service level (capturing observed multi-period delays) against holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: recent demand samples show high variability (history demands: [80,120,120,93,177,...,76]) and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=537 units (large outstanding pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals across history consistently show lead_time often =3 (several PeriodX\u2192PeriodX+3 observations) though occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals occur. Given sustained evidence of longer lead times and large in-transit volume, set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the OR engine size base-stock against the inferred lead time while accounting for historical demand variability and the large pipeline.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=537; historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133) with recent mix. To hedge persistent delays while adapting to recent demand, I set lead time estimation to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the last observed lead-time behavior (avg \u22481.8). Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) based on the most recent five demand observations (Periods 26\u201330: 120,89,115,76,105) so mu_hat reflects current regime. Volatility likewise uses recent_N (N=5). These choices balance service (capture delayed arrivals) versus holding cost by focusing on recent patterns rather than long-ago spikes.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=537 (many overdue shipments visible earlier). Historical conclues show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple P arrivals with W=3), so I let backend compute average observed lead time (method=calculate) to capture realized delays. Recent demand (Periods 27-31 = 89,115,76,105,103; mean\u224897.6) appears representative with no clear sustained regime shift, so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest demand level and volatility. These settings balance service (capturing longer observed lead time) against holding cost by basing safety stock on recent demand and letting OR compute exact base_stock/z given profit vs holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=537. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead_time=3 (multiple confirmed arrivals at lag 3). To reflect observed reality and ensure pipeline coverage, set L explicit=3. Recent demand has settled around ~103 units (Periods 28-32: 115,76,105,103,111 -> mean ~102.8), so use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime and variability. These choices make the OR backend target (1+L)-period demand under the observed lead time and use recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=537. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple orders with lead_time=3 observed across history) and recent long delays (large outstanding in-transit volume). I set L using recent_N to bias toward the recent dominant lead time (3) while averaging short-term variability (N=5). Demand will use default aggregation (all samples) to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean across history; volatility also default so backend scales std by sqrt(1+L). These choices raise the backend base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline and the (L+1) demand window, reducing stockouts given many in-transit units and observed 3-period delays while keeping sigma from overfitting short noisy bursts.

To protect service given confirmed longer lead time and large pipeline, I set L explicitly=3 to match observed delivery behavior. I use default demand sizing (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility so the OR engine applies the base-stock formula with the longer review+lead window, balancing high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) while the large in-transit volume reduces aggressive ordering.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with many 3-period observations and some 1\u20132 period arrivals; recent long gaps and many in-transit units suggest intermittent delays and occasional lost shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average of all observed lead times (captures the realized >2 behavior seen repeatedly). For demand forecasting I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving full-sample demand information given no confirmed recent sustained demand regime change. This balances service (by using realized lead time) against holding costs while leaving order sizing to the capped policy to limit oversized replenishment given in-transit volume.

Demand has recently been lower (~86\u2013111); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the latest regime (captures periods 32\u201336).

I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed/recurring 3-period lead times (reduces stockouts from assuming promised 2). Demand recently is lower-moderate; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the OR forecast on the most recent regime (periods 33-37) so base-stock and safety stock react to current demand rather than older volatile samples. This balances service (higher L) versus holding cost by sizing orders to recent demand over the review+lead window.

I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this leverages full history for stable demand estimate while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and prevents under-ordering; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) against carrying cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=537. Historical concludes show sustained lead_time=3 (multiple orders that arrived after 3 periods); several shipments previously delayed beyond promised L=2. To ensure pipeline coverage I'll set L explicitly to 3. No sustained demand regime shift is evident in the provided demand samples, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility. This increases pipeline cover to match observed arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost given high profit ($19) relative to holding ($1).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=537. History shows repeated 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16) indicating actual lead time \u22483. With promised L=2 but confirmed L=3, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend stocks for a 4-period demand window. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances raising base-stock for longer lead time while using full-sample demand estimates.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=537. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple observed orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). To ensure the OR engine plans for the longer effective pipeline, set L explicit=3. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so backend uses full-history mean and std scaled by (1+L); this balances service level given confirmed longer lead time while avoiding ad-hoc forecast tweaks absent a clear sustained demand regime shift.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Historical sample mean = 118 units; recent history shows long delays but demand steady with occasional spikes. On-hand=0, in-transit=537 => substantial pipeline but arrivals have lagged historically (confirmed lead time=3). To ensure the OR engine plans for the observed 3-period delivery delay I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (with L=3) \u2014 this balances service level given confirmed longer lead time while avoiding ad-hoc demand overstating from short recent zeros.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent concluded history shows many periods with zero arrivals while in-transit=537, indicating persistent shipment delays/losses. Demand samples available (historic list) show moderate mean; to protect service given observed longer lead times, set lead time explicitly to 3 (matches multiple concluded observations). Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=3, keeping conservative stocking to cover the longer effective lead time while avoiding excessive hand-holding since holding cost is low relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged missing arrivals since Period_24 through Period_43 despite in-transit inventory; 537 units currently in-transit \u2014 suggests several lost or severely delayed shipments.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=537 with a long history of delayed/missing arrivals (many shipments overdue since Period_24). Observed concluded lead times (13 observations) average ~2.15 periods, showing a small shift above the promised L=2 but with mixed short (1) and long (3) outcomes. To adapt to the demonstrated longer-than-promised delivery while letting the OR engine compute demand over review+lead using all demand data, I set L using calculate (average observed lead time) so the backend internal (1+L) demand window reflects realized delays. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), respectively \u2014 this balances service level uplift from the slightly longer inferred lead time against holding cost given large in-transit uncertainty and many potentially lost shipments.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=537 with long history of delayed/missing arrivals (many orders beyond promised L=2 never concluded; multiple observed lead_times=3). Demand history shows recent sustained nonzero demand (samples provided). I set L explicit=3 because concluded arrivals repeatedly indicate a 3-period lead time and many shipments are delayed beyond promised 2 \u2014 treating lead time as 3 better matches observed arrival timing and prevents under-ordering. mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so the OR engine will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples with L=3, giving a conservative replenishment level that balances high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) while accounting for longer effective pipeline.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=537. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent lead_time=3 (multiple periods) and many later missing arrivals; average observed lead time > promised. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (captures the sustained shift to ~3). For demand I use 'default' (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) because recent demand shows no abrupt sustained upward/downward regime lasting 3+ periods beyond normal volatility; using all samples smooths noise. sigma_hat='default' uses all-sample std scaled for (1+L). These choices increase protection for the longer realized lead time while avoiding overfitting short-term demand noise and help the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given the delayed/lost shipments.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_48. On-hand=0, in-transit=537 with long history of delayed/lost arrivals since Period_24\u201343 and several confirmed 3-period lead times earlier (Periods 1\u21924,4\u21927,5\u21928). Promised L=2 is unreliable; evidence supports using L=3 (explicit) to capture observed delays. Demand has been consistently ~80\u2013160 across many recent periods; to reflect the most recent regime (last ~20 periods of steady ~100s demand) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 so the OR backend forecasts (1+L) period demand and recent volatility while the larger L accounts for delayed arrivals and reduces under-ordering risk given high profit relative to holding cost.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. On-hand=0, in-transit=537 -> large pipeline with prolonged delays. Historical concludes show repeated 3-period arrivals (e.g., Period1\u21924, Period4\u21927, Period5\u21928) and many overdue shipments since Period_24; actual lead time is best treated as 3. To be conservative, set L explicit=3 to force the OR engine to plan for the longer observed lead time. Demand has varied recently; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the latest five observed demands (Periods 44\u201348: 118,124,113,53,65) rather than older regimes. This balances service level (longer L) against holding costs given already-large in-transit inventory and missing arrivals.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50. On-hand=0, in-transit=537 with prolonged missing/delayed shipments historically; lead time has repeatedly been 3 in concluded history. Demand history shows multi-period nonzero demand with recent average near prior long-run levels. To protect service given confirmed longer lead time and large in-transit uncertainty, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history (robust to regime noise). This balances service level (accounting for L=3) while relying on historical volatility for safety stock; we avoid overfitting to recent noisy arrivals which appear unreliable.
