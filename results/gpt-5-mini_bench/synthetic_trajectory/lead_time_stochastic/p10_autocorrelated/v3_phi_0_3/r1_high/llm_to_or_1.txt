Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals yet. Historical demand samples: [80,120,120,93,177] (mean=118). Promised lead time=2. No evidence of lead-time or demand regime change (only 5 samples, no sustained shift). Use default lead time to trust promise and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std automatically. This balances service level (covers review+lead demand) without overreacting to noise given zero on-hand and no delayed-arrival signals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=180 (order placed Period_1). Promised lead time is 2. The Period_1 conclude shows arrived=0 for the Period_1 order \u2014 this is expected because with promised L=2 the order would arrive during Period_3 and be visible in Period_3 conclude; do not treat this as a missing shipment yet. Demand history mean \u2248118 (samples: 80,120,120,93,177). To balance service level vs holding cost, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std automatically. This keeps parameters aligned with the promised lead time while preserving the backend's statistical treatment and caps.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3. Demand history (all samples): [80,120,120,93,177] \u2192 mean=118. On-hand=0, in-transit=352 (orders from P1+P2). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer a lead-time change; shipments may still be in-transit. Using default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample demand; with (1+L)*mean = 3*118 = 354, pipeline (352) is ~2 units short of target\u2014small shortfall handled by OR cap logic. This balances service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding overstock given uncertain arrivals.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_4. Promised L=2 but orders placed in Periods 1-3 (total in-transit=455) have produced no arrivals in concluded messages through Period_3, suggesting actual lead time is longer than promised. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 to cover the observed delay. I use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples (Period_1\u2013Period_5) \u2014 this increases the order target to cover the longer review+lead window while letting the backend apply the profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (total in-transit=455) had arrived=0 by Period_3 conclude, indicating lead-time delays beyond promised 2 periods.

Daily Profit: $2736.00, Daily Holding Cost: $139.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2597.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start: on-hand=139, in-transit=288 (total pipeline=427). Concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times: observed arrivals indicate lead_time=3 (order P1) and lead_time=1 (order P3) so average observed LT\u22482. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use average of observed lead times. Demand estimate and volatility use historical samples default ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine bases orders on full-sample statistics while accounting for inferred average lead time. This balances service (capture variable LT) vs holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=15, in-transit=443. Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (Period_4 arrivals imply lead_time=3 for P1 and lead_time=1 for P3) and the P5 order has not concluded. To reconcile uncertainty I set L by averaging observed lead times (captures recent variability). Demand history mean=118 units; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the chosen L so the backend balances service level vs holding cost given observed lead-time variability.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=7. On-hand=0, in-transit=564; recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W=3 from P1->P4 and W=1 from P3->P4). I set L via "calculate" to let the backend average observed lead times (captures the mixed evidence without overcommitting). Demand history includes Periods 1\u20136 samples [80,120,120,93,177,97]; no sustained >3-period demand regime shift, so I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to weight the full recent history ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples). I keep sigma_hat as "default" to use full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service level (use recent demand average) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and uncertain but average lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1164.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8. Recent realized demand has softened (most recent demands P3\u2013P7 = 73,144,124,97,64) vs earlier spikes; on-hand=52 and in-transit=448 (large pipeline) with multiple delayed arrivals. Observed concluded lead times: P1->P4 = 3, P3->P4 = 1, P4->P7 = 3 \u2014 overall skew toward 3-period deliveries, so I use the average-based lead time estimator. To avoid excess holding given high pipeline and lower recent demand, I base demand forecast on the most recent 5 periods (captures the downshift) and use recent volatility over the same window. These choices reduce target base-stock relative to older high-demand samples and account for confirmed longer lead time delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: order on Period 1 arrived Period 4; order on Period 4 arrived Period 7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $973.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=148, in-transit=306. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times observed = [3,1,3,3] (avg 2.5) with multiple 3-period observations, so use calculated average lead time. Use default demand estimates (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history, balancing service vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead times and current healthy pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1079.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent observed demand (Periods 5\u20139) has softened vs earlier spikes. On-hand=99, in-transit=386; several past shipments confirmed actual lead time=3 (orders P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) so I treat lead time as 3 to ensure pipeline covers true delay. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N on the most recent regime (Periods 5\u20139, N=5) because mean demand fell to ~81.2 over those 5 periods; mu_hat recent_N will let backend compute (1+L)*mean_recent to cover the review+lead horizon while reacting to the decline. I also set sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce risk of stockouts from underestimated lead time while avoiding excess safety stock from older high-demand periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: recent demands show variability with a one-off spike (Period_10=139) but no sustained regime change (last 5 demands: 97,64,59,62,139). On-hand=0, in-transit=386 (pipeline large). Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time=3 periods (orders from P1->P4, P4->P7). Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid underordering. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default since no sustained demand shift (conservative pooling of all samples) and to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs holding cost given high pipeline.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 decision. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (evidence: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=545 \u2014 pipeline covers ~545/4\u2248136 units/period for (1+L)=4 periods, which is above recent demand but avoids stockouts given delayed arrivals. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 7\u201311 demand: 64,59,62,139,123) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent to adapt to the recent lower-but-variable demands with one spike. I keep sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize service (avoid lost-sales from prolonged lead times) while letting the backend cap orders to limit excess inventory.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 13. History shows multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12), so I set L to calculated average of observed lead times (reflecting confirmed LT=3). On-hand=6 and in-transit=452 \u2014 large pipeline exists but delays have occurred historically; using default demand/volatility (which apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples) keeps the OR backend conservative and aligned with the longer inferred lead time while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy swings. No new sustained demand regime change detected, so sigma uses default as well.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. History shows repeated arrivals with actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals from orders on P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12). On-hand=0, in-transit=494 so pipeline is large. Given confirmed LT=3, set lead time explicitly to 3 to ensure mu_hat covers (1+L) review+lead demand. Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L and sqrt(1+L>) to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap using historical samples; this balances service (higher target due to longer LT) vs holding cost given existing heavy pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=56, in-transit=374. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead times \u22483 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=3); some 1-period anomalies exist but majority=3. Pipeline (56+374) is ample versus recent demand; however promised LT=2 is unreliable. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect realized lead-time distribution. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the engine target the profit/holding tradeoff while accounting for the longer inferred lead time.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=434. Historical concludes show most observed lead times = 3 periods (several P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14) with occasional 1-period arrivals; overall average lead time > promised 2. Use calculate for L to reflect observed average lead time from concluded history. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring orders cover the (L+1)-period demand window and balance service level vs holding cost given delayed arrivals and sizable in-transit volume.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed history shows consistent arrivals with actual lead time = 3 periods (evidence: Period_4 conclude: P1\u2192P4; Period_7 conclude: P4\u2192P7; Period_12 conclude: P9\u2192P12; Period_14 conclude: P11\u2192P14; Period_16 conclude: P13\u2192P16). On-hand=0, in-transit=442 so pipeline substantial but delayed\u2014use explicit L=3 to reflect confirmed lead time so the OR backend sizes orders over the correct (1+L) horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand mean/variance over (1+L) periods from full sample history; this balances service level (higher base-stock for longer lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging many shipments were delayed rather than lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1691.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=3 for multiple orders (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16), so I set L=3 to reflect the confirmed longer lead time. Using mu_hat default lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to scale demand over the review+lead period; sigma_hat default lets backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These choices increase the order-up-to level to cover the 4-period exposure while relying on full-sample demand stats given limited data and the clear lead-time regime.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=529. Recent concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead_time=3 as dominant (many arrivals from orders placed 3 periods earlier, with occasional 1-period arrivals). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times (captures the realized >2 periods pattern). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' to use all demand samples (stable demand history available) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level given longer effective lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=20. Recent demand has been high and variable (Periods 15\u201319 demands = 61,136,116,98,145; recent 5-period avg \u2248111). On-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained lead-time shift to 3 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=3). To protect service and account for confirmed longer lead time, I set L explicitly=3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the current higher-demand regime (covers review+lead period). This balances higher service-level needs (profit >> holding cost) while keeping volatility-driven safety stock responsive to recent variability.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
We observe repeated 3-period arrivals in the conclude history (multiple orders with lead_time=3 and some 1s); average of observed lead times is above the promised 2, and in-transit=555 is large with on-hand=0, so use an empirically estimated L to capture longer/mixed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute demand across review+lead using all samples given limited, noisy recent regime evidence. This balances higher safety stock for longer/mixed lead times while keeping demand forecast grounded in full historical samples.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_22. On-hand=0, in-transit=555. Historical conclude messages show multiple arrivals with observed lead_time=3 (orders on P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17), indicating actual lead time has been persistently 3 periods (longer than promised 2). I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. Demand recent regime (Periods 14\u201321) has mean ~105.5 units; using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat over the last 8 periods captures the current demand level and variability. Using recent_N (N=8) with L=3 yields a (1+L)-scaled forecast that balances service (covers 4 periods of demand given L=3 and review) against holding cost; matching actual lead time reduces stockouts from delayed arrivals.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: on-hand=0, in-transit=555. History shows repeated delays with many concluded lead times =3 and some =1 (evidence in conclude messages), so promised 2 is unreliable. I set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate) so the OR backend uses the empirical average lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) to balance service vs. holding given high profit and low holding cost. This accounts for overdue pipeline while avoiding aggressive explicit overorders given uncertain loss/delay patterns.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 3-period arrivals with occasional 1-periods; observed lead times = {3,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,1,3,3} (11 samples) \u2192 average \u2248 2.45. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) mean = 118.0. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the observed average lead time (captures drift from promised 2). For mu_hat/sigma_hat I choose 'default' so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples; this balances service level (captures longer effective lead time) against holding cost given in-transit stock. No new immediate evidence of a sustained demand regime shift; monitor arrivals for lost shipments.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 25 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=529. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (orders from P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, etc.), so I set L explicitly to 3. Recent demand has been lower than early periods; I use recent_N (N=5, periods 20\u201324) to capture the current lower-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes the (1+L)-period forecast and uncertainty around the recent mean/volatility rather than the full-sample mean, reducing overstock risk given long lead times and holding cost.

Demand recently averages lower than early bursts; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the OR engine responsive to the most recent demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 5 samples).

LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=529, recent observed lead-times consistently 3 periods (historic concludes show multiple orders with lead_time=3). I set L to "calculate" so the backend uses observed lead-times (captures confirmed LT=3). Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use "default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, letting the model scale safety stock for the inferred longer lead time and balance service vs. holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. On-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, etc.). Several earlier periods showed long delays and missing same-period arrivals, so I treat lead time as 3 to reflect realized behavior. With L=3 I use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it produce a base-stock that balances the high unit profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) while accounting for the longer pipeline. This keeps ordering aggressive enough to cover the 4-period review+lead demand while not overstating demand by manual adjustment. No new sustained regime shifts beyond the already-confirmed LT=3.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_29. On-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, etc.), so use L=3 to reflect realized delays. Demand recent window (Periods 24-28: 94,84,142,116,93) appears representative\u2014no strong sustained regime shift beyond this window\u2014so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture current mean and volatility over the review+lead period (1+L). This increases forecast coverage for the longer confirmed lead time while keeping variability responsive to recent demand. This choice mitigates stockouts from delayed shipments and avoids excessive holding by limiting the window to recent demand.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Historical demand samples (seed) avg=118 units/period; recent long-run history shows frequent stockouts and arrivals consistently occurring 3 periods after order (evidence in concludes P4, P7, P8, P12, P14, P16, P17, P23). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 (pipeline large but delayed). Because multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=3 (sustained, repeated), set L explicit=3 to reflect reality. Use default demand aggregation so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat scaled by sqrt(1+L); this gives a conservative replenishment target accounting for confirmed longer lead time while letting OR backend balance service vs holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Historical concluded messages show actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=529 (multiple earlier orders in-transit). Given sustained evidence of 3-period lead time I set L explicitly to 3. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all demand samples; this leverages full sample history to size the review+lead demand forecast and variability while letting the backend apply the profit/holding tradeoff and the capped order cap. This balances service level (longer confirmed lead time) versus holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: recent history shows frequent actual lead time = 3 periods (many arrivals tied to orders 3 periods earlier) with intermittent 1-period arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=529 (large pipeline). To capture the observed lead-time regime I request the backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). Use default demand aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat are set to (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively \u2014 this balances service level against holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time and sizeable in-transit inventory.

Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (multiple orders arriving 3 periods after order) with some 1-period exceptions; average observed lead time \u22482.4. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time (captures the persistent shift toward 3). Demand has no clear recent regime change (many zero-order stretches), so use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility. This balances service (accounting for longer effective lead time) against holding cost given large current pipeline inventory.

Use explicit L=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR backend sizes base stock for a review+lead horizon of 4 periods. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which increases safety stock to cover the longer confirmed lead time while letting the capped-order rule limit single-period ordering.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period actual lead time (evidence in history). To ensure pipeline covers upcoming demand I set lead time to 3. Using default demand scaling lets OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean from samples (robust given limited sample set) and default volatility scaling. This balances service level (capture confirmed longer lead time) vs holding cost by relying on backend's z* calculation rather than inflating explicit safety stock.

I therefore treat lead time as 3 to reflect observed shipments and avoid under-ordering.

To ensure pipeline covers review+lead demand given confirmed LT=3 and the available demand samples, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period demand. I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), balancing service level (via base-stock) against holding cost while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time.

Use default demand aggregation ((1+L)*mean of all samples) for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat so the OR engine increases base-stock to cover the longer review+lead window and the observed demand history while letting the backend apply its capped ordering cap.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 41, on-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=3) with occasional 1-period anomalies; evidence supports using observed lead-time statistics rather than promised. Demand recent trend (Periods 36\u201340 = 128,101,112,68,67) averages ~95 units; I use recent demand to capture current lower/volatile regime. Chosen methods: L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures the persistent 3-period pattern); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands, aligning safety stock with recent demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (using observed longer lead times and recent demand) against holding cost by avoiding inflation from older high-demand periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders observed arriving after 3 periods). Demand history (Periods 1\u201341) shows average \u224899.6 units/period; with L=3 we target a 4-period demand forecast. Choose L=explicit (3) to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid underordering from promised 2. Use mu_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 4\xd7mean (captures full-sample demand ~99.6\u2192\u2248398). Use sigma_hat=default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to scale volatility for 4-period aggregation. This balances service (using confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent demand has averaged roughly 80\u2013140 units/period (many periods ~100). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=3 (multiple orders placed arrived after 3 periods), so I treat actual lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. I set L explicit=3. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the estimate on the most recent 20 demand observations (captures recent regime around ~80\u2013140). These choices ensure the OR engine targets a base-stock that covers review+lead horizon under the observed longer lead time while using recent demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=529. Using L=3 ensures the OR backend plans over review+lead=(1+L)=4 periods. Historical seed demand mean=118 (HISTORICAL DEMAND DATA), so 4-period demand \u2248472; current pipeline (529) exceeds this so no immediate deficit. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine produce the capped base-stock order while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock.

To reflect the confirmed longer transit and avoid under-ordering, set L explicit=3. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a stable forecast across the longer review+lead period while the large in-transit position is consumed.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering due to the promised 2-period assumption. Demand signal: use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) to forecast across review+lead period; this balances service (higher target because L=3) vs holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Historical arrivals show sustained 3-period lead time; to protect service given confirmed longer lead time I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent demand regime (captures recent elevated and variable demand). This yields (1+L)-period demand forecast based on latest average while keeping variability estimate recent to size safety stock appropriately given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_48: demand history shows moderate, variable weekly demand; provided historical samples (Period_1\u20135) seed forecasts. On-hand=0, in-transit=584 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are delayed historically (confirmed actual lead time=3). To account for observed LT=3 and avoid stockouts, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (this leverages full sample set while the explicit L captures the confirmed longer lead time). This balances higher safety stock from longer L against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49. Demand history shows frequent demands ~70\u2013155 with no recent arrivals visible; on-hand=0, in-transit=584. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (Period_1\u2192P4, Period_4\u2192P7). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering from assuming promised 2. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (leveraging full history). With profit $19 >> holding $1 the backend's service-level q will be high; using full-history estimates with corrected L lets the backend size orders to meet demand while the large in-transit reduces the immediate need for extra ordering.

To capture the empirically observed lead time I request L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (reflecting the sustained 3-period behavior). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast that balances service level and holding cost given long lead times and existing large pipeline.
