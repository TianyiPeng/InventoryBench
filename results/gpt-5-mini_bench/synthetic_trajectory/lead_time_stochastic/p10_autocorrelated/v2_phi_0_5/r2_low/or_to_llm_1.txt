Recent concludes (P36\u2192P37, P32\u2192P33, P23\u2192P25) show arrivals can be 1\u20133 periods after ordering, and many in-transit units have previously been unreliable; therefore I treat the pipeline (in-transit=1642) as partially unreliable for immediate coverage. Demand & inventory: Recent demand (Periods 31\u201339: 57,22,67,62,58,90,120,95,117) averages \u224878\u201390 units/period; short-term demand appears lower than the earliest-period mean but with occasional spikes (120,117). With promised lead time L=2 and uncertain actual lead time, we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (to cover current period demand which happens after decision). OR recommends 0 using historical means and promised lead time; given on-hand=0 and unreliable pipeline, following OR = 0 risks immediate stockout. Tradeoff: Profit=$1 and Holding=$1 make holding expensive (symmetric), so avoid large excess stock. Decision: order 200 units. Reasoning: 200 covers roughly 2\u20133 periods at recent demand rates (\u224880\u2013100/day) without over-committing given holding cost and large but unreliable in-transit; it also mirrors the recent order size (Period 39 ordered 200) that may arrive soon. This is a moderate override of OR (0\u2192200) to mitigate immediate stockout risk while limiting holding cost exposure under lead-time uncertainty.

Inventory & demand: On-hand = 32 units, recent realized single-period demand typically ~90\u2013140 (recent periods average \u2248100), so current on-hand covers <<1 period.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Many past orders exhibited variable lead times and suspected lost shipments; in-transit=1712 is therefore unreliable (carry-over notes). On-hand=0 so any immediate demand will stockout unless some in-transit units actually arrive this period, but arrivals occur after the decision and are uncertain. Demand estimate: historical single-period mean \u2248116 (samples provided). Cost trade-off: profit = $1 and holding = $1 per unit \u2192 critical fractile 0.5 (no safety stock incentive). OR recommends 0 units (uses promised L=2 and historical demand). Given large, unreliable pipeline and symmetric profit/holding costs, ordering risks creating ending inventory that is as costly as revenue; with supplier disruption evidence and many outstanding unconfirmed shipments, I avoid adding more inventory now. Action: place 0 units and wait for conclude messages to confirm which in-transit units actually arrive before increasing orders.",
