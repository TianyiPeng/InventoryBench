On-hand=0 and in-transit=935 but pipeline contains many unconfirmed/late shipments, so I treat in-transit as unreliable for short-term coverage.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period actual lead times (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P27\u2192P29), so I treat actual lead time as 3 periods for planning. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=1283 (pipeline_total=1283). Demand forecast: use the provided demand samples (75,138,134,122,111) \u2192 mean \u03bc\u0304\u2248116, sample std \u03c3\u0304\u224825.25.

Risks considered: some earlier shipments were delayed/lost, but recent pattern shows delayed but eventual arrivals; given large in-transit balance ordering more risks excess holding cost. Decision: place 0 units (follow OR's capped recommendation) to avoid unnecessary holding cost while pipeline covers expected (L+1)-period demand plus safety stock.",
