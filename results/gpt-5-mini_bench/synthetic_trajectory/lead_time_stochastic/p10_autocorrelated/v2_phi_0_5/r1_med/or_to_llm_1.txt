Inventory & demand math: historical sample mean \u03bc\u0304 = (75+138+134+122+111)/5 = 116 units/period, so the (1+L)-period demand (L=2) \u03bc\u0302 = 3\xd7116 = 348 units.

Rationale: avoid adding to inventory given pipeline > required \u03bc\u0302 and high holding cost, while monitoring concluded arrivals to determine whether the in-transit units are truly en route or lost; if future concludes continue to show no arrivals, switch to contingency (reorder from alternate source) in later periods.
