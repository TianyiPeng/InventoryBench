Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Use promised lead time (default) L=2. Demand history (5 samples) shows no recent changepoint; use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ($4/$1).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2. Historical per-period mean demand \u2248100.4 (samples P1\u2013P5). On-hand=0, in-transit=138 from Period 1 (arrived=0 in P1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; shipment may still be in-transit. Promised lead time=2 retained. I choose default lead time so backend uses promised L=2. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given no confirmed regime or lead-time change and limited concluded evidence. If the in-transit order fails to conclude in future periods, I will escalate to an explicit longer L.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 context: promised lead time is 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=272 (two prior orders have not concluded => cannot infer actual lead time yet). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean ~100.4. No sustained demand or lead-time change detected. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so OR backend uses all-sample mean and std scaled for (1+L)=3. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively given large in-transit inventory and lack of confirmed lead-time shifts.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=322 (orders placed P1:138, P2:134, P3:50) and no arrivals observed in Periods 2-4 conclude messages despite promised lead time=2. Historical demand samples (used): [74,108,88,98,134]. Because three consecutive order placements (total 322) have not concluded by their promised arrival window, I treat lead time as longer than promised and set L explicitly to 3 to cover the longer arrival horizon. Demand forecast uses recent_N over the 5 available samples to capture the uptick in the most recent period. Sigma uses default to let the OR engine scale volatility over (1+L). These choices increase pipeline coverage for potential delayed shipments while letting the backend compute service-level safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time likely >=3 periods: orders placed on Periods 1-3 (138+134+50=322) remain in-transit with no arrivals by Period_4 conclude, indicating sustained delivery delay.

Daily Profit: $364.00, Daily Holding Cost: $97.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $267.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=97, in-transit=282; recent conclude shows mixed but substantial delays (P1->arrived in P4 => lead_time=3). Pipeline is large but deliveries have been delayed historically. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed multi-period delays and to ensure the OR engine plans for the longer effective lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent realized demand regime (periods 1-4 concludes) so the (1+L) multiplier applies to current demand levels while accounting for the observed delay. This balances higher safety stock (to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) against holding cost by using only the recent four-period demand signal rather than all-time averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $283.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=21, in-transit=351. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (order from P1 arrived with lead_time=3; order from P3 arrived with lead_time=1) and recent orders remain outstanding, indicating variable/extended lead times. I set L using "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability seen). For demand I use "default" so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) \u2014 a conservative multi-period forecast given high in-transit volume and the need to cover (L+1) periods. For sigma_hat I use "default" so variability is scaled by sqrt(1+L), balancing service level vs holding cost under lead-time uncertainty.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=411. Concluded arrivals show an order placed in Period_1 arrived with lead_time=3 (evidence actual lead time \u22653) and other orders delayed; several recent shipments were late or missing. To protect service given observed delays I set L explicitly to 3. Demand forecast uses the most recent 5 demand samples to capture current regime (recent_N, N=5); sigma uses default to reflect overall historical volatility. These choices raise the (1+L)-period forecast to cover longer pipeline exposure while keeping variance estimation broad for the OR backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=96, in-transit=289. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = [3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P4->P7)] indicating recent tendency toward 3-period deliveries but some variability. I set L using recent_N (N=3) to let backend average the last 3 observed lead times. Demand history (samples: 74,108,88,98,134) shows no clear sustained regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances higher effective lead time (protects service level given delayed arrivals) against holding cost by relying on backend's z* calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P4, P4 order arrived P7)

Daily Reward (R_t): $299.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=93, in-transit=235. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). I set L=explicit(3) to align forecasting window with observed delivery delays. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (avoiding older noisy samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demand samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the 4-period (review+lead) demand while the sigma estimate supports safety stock to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=37, in-transit=252. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 3) with average \u22482; several multi-period delays occurred earlier so use inferred average lead time. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times. Demand samples (74,108,88,98,134) show mean\u2248100.4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L) scaling) so the OR engine computes base_stock using all history and the inferred L. This balances service (covers (1+L) periods) while avoiding overly aggressive explicit forecasts given mixed lead-time evidence and existing large pipeline.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: recent demand (P6-P10) = [115,52,98,97,82], mean=88.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=370 (covers some future demand but shipments have exhibited 3-period lead time). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time (arrivals show P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (post-spike variability) yielding mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent, which biases orders to cover 4 periods of expected demand. Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher base-stock for 4-period coverage) given confirmed longer lead time while using recent data to avoid overreacting to older samples.

Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=396. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7), so I set L=3 to reflect observed delivery delay and ensure pipeline covers extra delay. Using mu_hat default lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean over all demand samples so the forecast scales with the longer lead+review horizon; sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to reflect increased variability over the longer horizon. This balances higher service level (to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135: 74,108,88,98,134) show moderate variance; current on-hand=26, in-transit=246. History of concluded arrivals shows mixed lead-times (observed W={3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2}); some shipments were delayed/lost early but later arrivals confirm variability with a central tendency \u22482.1 periods. I choose L by "calculate" so the backend uses the observed lead-time average (captures delivered delays without overcommitting). I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat as "default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this gives a conservative replenishment target that balances service level (accounts for longer effective lead time) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent conclude history shows multiple lead_time=3 observations (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12) with one 2-period and some 1-period anomalies. On-hand=0, in-transit=380 \u2014 substantial pipeline consistent with multi-period lead time. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed/recurring 3-period lead time so the OR engine orders for a 4-period coverage window. Demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean ~100.4; using default mu_hat/sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=3, balancing service level (captures observed longer lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period lead time (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P11\u2192P14). On-hand=0, in-transit=408 so pipeline is large but deliveries are delayed historically. I set L explicitly=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default to capture overall variability across the (L+1) horizon; this biases orders to cover the longer confirmed lead time and reduces stockouts while keeping the OR engine's capped order constraint intact.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=415. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P12\u2192P15), and multiple overdue arrivals earlier\u2014so use explicit L=3 to reflect observed reality. Use default demand sizing (mu_hat default) and default volatility (sigma_hat default) so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided samples; this keeps forecasts aligned with historical sample base while the explicit lead time accounts for delayed shipments and ensures pipeline coverage over the longer arrival horizon.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=69, in-transit=306. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple lead_time=3 observations (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16) with occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals; average observed lead time \u22482.45. Given repeated multi-period delays and substantial pipeline, set L to calculate so backend uses observed average lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let OR engine compute demand across review+lead period from full history; this balances service level (captures longer effective lead time) vs holding cost while leveraging large in-transit volume to avoid over-ordering in presence of delayed arrivals.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_18: observed on-hand=30, in-transit=254. History shows multiple arrivals with lead_time=3 (consistent delays); pipeline is large relative to on-hand. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples \u2014 this keeps the forecast anchored to long-run sample stats while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and prevents under-ordering.

To align OR with observed delivery behavior I set L=3 explicitly. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this balances service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while respecting the confirmed longer lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (many orders placed then delivered 3 periods later). Demand samples (periods 1-5) have mean \u2248100.4. Given repeated 3-period arrivals and large in-transit volume, I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and ensure the OR engine sizes pipeline to cover the longer delivery lag. I use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) so the backend applies the full-scope forecast and uncertainty scaling for L=3; this balances the high service-level target (profit/holding \u2192 q=0.8) against holding cost while accounting observed delivery delays.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21 start. Recent demand has been high and volatile (recent 5 demands: P16-20 = 65,118,133,65,130 \u2192 mean ~102.2) and historical concluded arrivals confirm a 3-period lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=445 (adequate coverage for multiple periods). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures the recent elevated mean and variability) so the OR engine produces a base-stock appropriate for current demand while avoiding excessive inventory given holding cost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=467. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3 across Periods 4,7,8,12,14,15,16) though occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals occurred. To account for the sustained pattern of 3-period deliveries I bias the lead-time estimate toward recent observed behavior. I choose L using recent_N to average the most recent observed lead-time samples (N=5) so the OR engine uses a lead time reflecting recent delivery delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime from the provided samples. Sigma uses default to let the backend scale variability over the chosen lead time. These choices aim to increase pipeline cover (reduce stockouts from delayed shipments) while keeping holding risk explicit to the backend via default sigma.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: on-hand=0, in-transit=497. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3), so use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to let backend capture the empirical L. Demand history shows no clear recent regime change; use default heuristics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies full-sample statistics. This balances service (captures longer empirical lead time) vs holding cost by letting backend compute the appropriate base_stock and cap given observed variability and promised lead time.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=0, in-transit=445; recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but frequent 3-period arrivals. Use recent_N for L to capture current realized lead-time regime (avg of last 6 observed lead times). Demand historical samples are limited to the provided five-sample series; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices bias orders to cover the longer observed lead times (reducing stockouts given many 3-period arrivals) while relying on backend's cap to limit overordering and holding costs.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Many outstanding in-transit units suggest shipments are delayed but arriving with 3-period lag. I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed deliveries so the OR engine orders for the correct pipeline horizon. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to compute mu_hat so the forecast reflects the most recent demand regime (responsive to recent spikes and drops). I keep sigma_hat as default so volatility is estimated from full sample history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This combination aligns ordering to the confirmed 3-period lead time while adapting mean demand and preserving a conservative volatility estimate given intermittent delays.

Multiple conclude messages (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16) confirm sustained L=3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed deliveries so the OR engine plans across the correct review+lead horizon. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this uses full history while the explicit L raises coverage to reduce stockouts given high profit ($4) versus holding ($1).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical concluded arrivals show mixture of 1\u20133 period lead times with many 3-period delays; average observed lead time \u22482.2. Several past orders were substantially delayed, so I use an empirical average lead time to reflect realized delays. I select L by 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) so the backend accounts for actual delivery experience; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so demand scaling uses all historical samples across the resulting (1+L) review+lead window. This balances avoiding stockouts from delayed shipments (higher effective L) while letting the OR engine compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent concluded history shows multiple arrivals with varying lead times (observed lead times: 14 samples, avg \u22482.14), and demand samples historically moderate-to-high (see provided history). On-hand=0, in-transit=461 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrival timing is uncertain. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the slightly >2 actual mean). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use 'default' so the backend computes demand across the review+lead period using all samples; this balances service level against holding cost given large in-transit volume and noisy lead-time realizations.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed earlier). Recent demand (Periods 24-28) = [65,93,59,123,107], recent mean=89.4. Given confirmed LT=3, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans over the longer pipeline. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the recent demand regime (captures latest higher variability and avoids diluting with older data). This balances service level (avoid stockouts given long LT and large in-transit) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the most recent observed demand.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: recent history shows frequent long lead times (many observed =3) and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=461 (large pipeline; some early orders were delayed). Demand samples provided (Period_1-5) have mean ~100; profit/holding ratio favors filling demand but high pipeline suggests avoid over-ordering. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the sustained shift to ~3). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available demand samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and uncertain recent arrivals.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_31 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (evidence from P1\u2192P4 and P4\u2192P7). Recent demand has been elevated and more volatile versus the original seed samples, so I use recent data to forecast across the review+lead horizon. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time; set mu_hat recent_N N=5 and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to let the OR engine compute (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std from the most recent 5 demand observations, balancing service level versus holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period delays (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3 across history, dominant signal). Demand samples mean = (74+108+88+98+134)/5 = 100.4. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to capture persistent 3-period delivery behavior. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use default formulas so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (covers L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). Several earlier shipments were delayed or lost before this pattern stabilized; pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed by 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Demand baseline: historical sample mean = 100.4 (from provided samples); with review+lead (1+L)=4 this implies (1+L)*mean = 401.6, so I set mu_hat explicit=401.6 to ensure the base-stock accounts for 4 periods of expected demand given L=3. Demand std (all samples) \u224820.217, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2 gives sigma \u224840.434; I set sigma_hat explicit=40.434 to reflect observed volatility. These explicit settings align the OR backend to the confirmed 3-period delivery lag and the multi-period demand exposure, balancing service level (profit-driven) against holding cost given the large in-transit exposure.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7); treat actual lead time as 3. Many recent demands are elevated (Periods 29-33 = 88,126,127,121,152) indicating a higher recent regime. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time so the OR backend plans across the correct pipeline horizon. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) so base-stock and caps respond to the higher recent mean and volatility while avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long lead time) against holding costs by focusing forecasts on the latest sustained demand pattern.

LLM Rationale:

No clear new sustained demand regime beyond previously noted patterns. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures realized > promised delays). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service vs holding cost given uncertain but elevated pipeline.

Given high variability and many stockouts, use default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it produce a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while covering the (L+1) review+lead demand. This choice keeps the policy conservative to protect service level given prolonged delays and a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=508. Historical concluded messages (notably Period_4 and Period_8) confirm actual lead time = 3. To be conservative given prolonged past delays and large pipeline, set L explicit to 3. Use default demand estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples \u2014 this leverages full historical demand (no sustained recent demand regime shift detected) and lets the capped order cap limit order size given the large in-transit. This balances service (accounting for confirmed LT=3) versus holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7) and earlier prolonged delays\u2014I treat actual lead time as 3 to account for delayed shipments. I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend sizes pipeline for the longer delivery delay; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) so the backend recomputes demand across the review+lead period using full history.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=465. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple P#: lead_time=3) but also 1-2 period arrivals; average observed lead time is >2, so use calculated average to let backend capture this mix. Demand samples (provided) are limited; use default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level (using calculated L) against holding cost while leveraging backend's base-stock formula. Current in-transit (465) suggests substantial pipeline coverage; choosing calculate/default avoids overreacting to intermittent delays or losses.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=465, profit=4, holding=1. Historical conclude messages show variable but on average >2 periods; several confirmed 3-period arrivals. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent mix of 1\u20133 with mean ~2.12). For demand I use 'default' for mu_hat and 'default' for sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this leverages full history and lets the OR engine produce a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for the inferred longer lead time. This approach also avoids overreacting to noisy short-term spikes while acknowledging delayed arrivals (in-transit stock should cover multiple periods).

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent demand has been high and variable (historical samples show frequent 100+ demands). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=465 units (covers multiple periods). Historical concluded arrivals show varied lead times but average ~2.06 periods; some shipments were delayed but recent pattern centers near 2\u20133. To let the OR engine learn actual lead time from observed arrivals, I select L='calculate' (use observed average). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this balances service level (captures elevated mean demand) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples, letting OR engine account for demand uncertainty while respecting the confirmed lead time and current pipeline.

Historical conclude messages (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P12 etc.) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods and multiple delayed arrivals; therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed delivery behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the OR engine size base-stock and caps with the confirmed longer lead time. This addresses missing/delayed shipments by increasing the replenishment coverage (L+1 periods) while keeping demand estimates anchored to full-sample statistics.

To ensure pipeline covers the observed delays, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples) so the OR engine produces a base-stock that balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) under the confirmed longer lead time. Current large in-transit (461) will be reconciled by arrivals in forthcoming concludes; no aggressive upshift to mu_hat is needed now.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P34\u2192P36, P41\u2192P44) indicating actual lead time is persistently 3. To ensure pipeline coverage I set lead time explicit=3 so the OR engine sizes orders for the longer realized delay. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (using L=3) \u2014 this balances service (accounting for the confirmed longer lead time and large in-transit) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods repeatedly (e.g. P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P21\u2192P23, P34\u2192P36, P41\u2192P44). Given the sustained pattern and large in-transit volume, set L explicit=3 to reflect true delivery timing so the OR engine plans across a 4-period horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this leverages all data while the explicit L captures the prolonged lead-time risk and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, multiple 3-period observations), and many earlier promised arrivals were delayed/lost. To ensure pipeline coverage for the observed delay I set L explicitly to 3. Recent demand (Periods 45-49 = 125,87,69,82,79) indicates a lower recent mean than earlier bursts, so I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the OR backend forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent regime. These choices bias orders to cover 4 periods of demand under confirmed longer lead time while keeping safety stock sized to recent variability to limit holding cost given currently large in-transit volume.
