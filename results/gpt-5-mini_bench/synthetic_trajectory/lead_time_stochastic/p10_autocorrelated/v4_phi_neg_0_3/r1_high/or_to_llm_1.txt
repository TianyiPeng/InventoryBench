Concluded messages: Period1 conclude shows ordered=138 arrived=0; Period2 conclude shows ordered=0 arrived=0. According to rules, concluded arrivals are the only reliable signals of actual lead time/arrivals. The Period1 conclude reporting arrived=0 is a strong signal that the supplier did not deliver units as expected for that order (possible delay or zero-shipment). The in-transit=138 reported now is therefore unconfirmed by a conclude message and could represent delayed pipeline or inconsistent reporting. Demand outlook: empirical single-period mean \u2248100.4 \u2192 (L+1)=3 period expected demand \u2248301.2. OR base-stock logic implies a large replenishment; its cap (~138) limits order size. Decision logic: Because current on-hand=0, we cannot satisfy Period 3 demand from a same-period order. We must ensure pipeline + new order aim to cover the next (L+1)=3 periods of demand given high profit (q\u22480.95 \u2192 high service target). Given the ambiguous status of the earlier 138 (Period1 order) and the Period1 conclude showing arrived=0, we treat some or all of in-transit as unreliable. To be conservative and restore pipeline to the OR cap level (which already tempers variability), place an order equal to the OR cap (~138 units). This increases replenishment slightly above OR's 130 recommendation to cover possible lost/delayed shipment while avoiding excessive holding cost. Conclude: order 138 units so pipeline (reported 138) plus this order (which will arrive after promised lead time) brings our committed pipeline toward the base-stock target without overshooting the OR cap.
