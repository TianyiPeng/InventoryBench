  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u21924,5\u21928,9\u219212,12\u219215,13\u219216,14\u219217 and Period 18 insight) confirm actual lead time \u22483 periods. Inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=502 units. Demand estimate: historical sample mean = 86.4 units/period \u2192 (L_actual+1)=4 periods demand \u2248 345.6 units. Decision logic: pipeline (502) comfortably exceeds 4-period expected demand so no replenishment is needed; ordering would only increase holding costs (holding cost = profit = $1/unit/period), so avoid excess inventory. OR recommended 0; I follow it given evidence of longer lead time and large in-transit volume. Final action: order 0 units.",
