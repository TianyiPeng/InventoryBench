  Samples: [('Period_1', 81), ('Period_2', 97), ('Period_3', 100), ('Period_4', 84), ('Period_5', 70)]
  Mean: 86.4, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Historical samples (Periods 1-5) show mean demand = (81+97+100+84+70)/5 = 86.4. Promised lead time is 2; with no evidence of lead-time or demand regime change, use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples. This keeps parameters conservative given zero inventory and avoids overfitting to short-run noise.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=107 (order placed P1) and P1 conclude shows arrived=0 => no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time is 2 and we have no sustained evidence to change it (single missed arrival could be normal). Use default lead time so OR backend assumes promised L. Demand history mean=86.4 units; with L=2 the review+lead period is 3 periods. Use default demand and volatility methods so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service (covers 3-period expected demand) against holding cost given high profit margin and low holding cost. We flag the in-transit 107 as expected pipeline but monitor for a conclude showing actual arrivals to revise L if shipments remain missing.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. On-hand=0, In-transit=218 (matches orders 107+111). No concluded arrivals yet (orders placed P1,P2 remain in-transit), so no evidence actual lead time deviates from promised L=2 and no lost shipments confirmed. Use default lead time and full-sample demand statistics: (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to let the OR backend compute base-stock given high profit ($19) vs holding ($1). This avoids overreacting to unconfirmed delays while the pipeline resolves.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: on-hand=0, in-transit=325. Historical demand samples (P1-5) mean=86.4 units/period. Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded (no arrivals shown in Periods 1-3 conclude), suggesting shipments are delayed or lost; be conservative on lead time. I set lead time explicitly to 3 to allow the OR engine to cover the longer effective pipeline. I use default demand aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and default sigma_hat to reflect full-sample volatility; this balances higher service level (given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders from Period_1 (107), Period_2 (111), and Period_3 (107) had arrived=0 in their conclude messages by Period_3, indicating sustained delivery issues / potential lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2826.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 context: on-hand=62, in-transit=228 (pipeline total=290). Concluded arrivals show orders from P1 (lead_time=3) and P3 (lead_time=1); P2 order still not arrived (possible lost/delayed). Observed lead times = {3,1} \u2192 average = 2, so use 'calculate' for L to reflect observed history. Demand history mean=86.4 over 5 samples; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) gives a forecast that leverages full sample history while the OR backend will set safety stock via profit/holding tradeoff. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods of demand given uncertain arrivals) against holding cost while acknowledging overdue shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1178.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_6 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=371. Historical demand samples mean=86.4 (periods 1-5). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: order from P1 arrived in P4 (lead_time=3), order from P3 arrived in P4 (lead_time=1) \u2014 use observed lead times to estimate L. Method choices: L set to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed 3 and 1 \u2192 avg 2). mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, leveraging full history while the calculated L accounts for delayed arrivals. This balances service (longer effective lead time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit volume and delivery variability.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=507, recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed 3 and 1). Several earlier orders were delayed/absent but we lack 3+ periods of consistent new lead-time evidence, so do not force an explicit lead-time change. I choose L by "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use "default" so demand forecast uses all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (using observed lead-time info) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2223.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: recent demand has stepped up since Period_4 (P4-P7: 152,136,160,137). On-hand=0, in-transit=422 \u2014 sizeable pipeline but past shipments have shown variable/long lead times (observed lead_times include 3,1,3). To capture the new higher demand regime I use a recent_N demand forecast (last 4 periods, Period_4\u2013Period_7). For lead time I request the backend calculate average observed lead time from concluded arrivals so the OR engine internal L reflects realized variability. Sigma set to recent_N to reflect increased volatility in the same recent window. These choices increase base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while letting the backend compute L from evidence and cap orders to limit excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg demand increased from 112.7 (P1\u2013P3) to 146.3 (P4\u2013P7) (+29.8%)

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 start. Observed lead times in concluded history = {3,1,3,3,1} (avg \u22482.2) indicating actual lead time slightly > promised; on-hand=61, in-transit=413 (ample pipeline). Demand regime shifted up at Period 4 and has persisted (P4\u2013P8 higher demand). To capture the sustained higher demand I use recent demand samples (most recent 5 periods) for mean and volatility, and use calculated average lead time from observed lead times so the OR engine sizes orders for the slightly longer realized lead time while backend still uses promised L internally. This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1613.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Recent history shows a demand regime shift starting Period 4 (higher mean from P4\u2013P9) and mixed lead-time behavior but observed lead times average ~2 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=135, in-transit=391 (ample pipeline). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (average of concluded lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-Period-4 higher-demand regime (Periods 4\u20139). For volatility I use recent_N N=6 to match the same recent regime. These choices bias the OR backend toward the new higher demand while using observed lead time behavior to avoid over/under-ordering given past delivery variability.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=48, in-transit=452. Observed concluded lead times from history = {3,1,3,3,1,1} \u2192 average \u22482, so use calculate for L. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 4; recent demand (Periods 4\u201310, 7 samples) best represents current mean/variance, so use recent_N N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices let the OR engine size base stock to cover the current review+lead demand while reflecting recent volatility and the observed longer/mixed lead-time pattern (helps avoid stockouts given delayed shipments while controlling holding cost).

Period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=514. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed Ls = 3,1,3,3,1,1 \u2192 avg 2), and there have been sustained delivery issues earlier but many units are in-transit now. Demand increased starting Period 4 and has persisted (use recent regime). Set L by calculate to reflect observed average lead time=2. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent demand regime (Periods 4\u201311, N=8) to capture the higher sustained demand and its volatility so the OR backend builds a base-stock that balances service level versus holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 13. On-hand=141, in-transit=344. History shows inconsistent lead times (observed W={3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2}) and past missing/delayed shipments; expected actual lead time > promised 2 so use empirical average. Demand history (Periods 1\u20135 samples: 81,97,100,84,70 provided earlier and subsequent demands in concludes) shows a prior regime shift already recorded; no new sustained demand signal. I select L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times average, mu_hat='default' to compute (1+L)*mean(all samples) so the base stock reflects full review+lead demand, and sigma_hat='default' to scale uncertainty by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level (due to delivery uncertainty) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand + large pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. On-hand=73, in-transit=344 (large pipeline) with prior sustained delivery issues (multiple orders delayed/lost earlier). Observed concluded lead times = [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2] \u2192 avg \u22482.125, so I use calculate for L to let backend infer actual average lead time. Demand regime shifted at Period 4 and has persisted (use recent data): I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 (use last 10 demand samples) so the (1+L) forecast and volatility reflect the post-shift regime and avoid understocking. These choices balance higher service needs after the confirmed demand increase while relying on recent variability; using calculate for L helps the model account for observed longer/mixed lead times and the sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. On-hand=75, in-transit=378 (total pipeline 453) and recent conclude history shows multiple lead-time observations (1,2,3) with average slightly >2. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time from concluded messages. Demand shows a sustained elevated and variable pattern since Period 4; I use the default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand samples, which balances service level (covers demand over review+lead) against holding cost given current large pipeline. No immediate new corrective actions required beyond using observed lead-time average.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 16: on-hand=26, in-transit=355. Historical concluded lead times observed = {3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3} (avg 2.3) so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand appears lower last 5 periods (P11\u2013P15 demands = 48,64,68,60,84); to be responsive to this regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures current demand level and volatility). These choices balance service (using observed longer average lead time) with lower recent demand to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed W values average \u22482.3), with recent concludes showing mostly 3-period deliveries\u2014evidence of actual lead time > promised. Several earlier shipments were delayed/lost but recent pipeline is large (355). Demand recently (P12\u2013P16) averaged ~73 units/period with moderate variability. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times average (captures multipeak 3-period behavior); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecasts to the most recent demand regime (P12\u2013P16) so orders cover (1+L) periods of current demand and limit excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=259. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period arrivals recently (last 5 observed lead times average \u22482.8) so I set L using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current slower fulfillment. Demand has been in the higher post-Period-4 regime for many periods; to capture that sustained regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with a window covering the recent regime (N=14) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand using recent elevated mean and volatility. No new single-period anomalies drive an explicit value choice. These settings bias orders upward to cover the longer effective lead time while reflecting the sustained higher demand, balancing lost sales (profit $19) against low holding cost ($1).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=418. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple confirmed P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P12->P15, P14->P17) so I'll let the backend calculate an updated average lead time from observed data. Demand shifted up at Period_4 and has persisted; to capture the post-change regime I use recent_N for demand stats using the last 15 periods (Period_4\u2013Period_18). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat will focus forecasts and uncertainty on the current higher-demand regime, while calculate for L lets the backend reconcile observed lead-time variability. This balances service (by recognizing longer/more variable lead time and higher mean demand) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory (418 units).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed arrivals: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P12->P15, P14->P17 \u2014 multiple 3-period observations)

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

A demand regime shift was detected starting Period_4 (higher mean from P4 onward) and has persisted through recent periods. To reflect confirmed LT=3 and the sustained higher-demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (Periods 4\u201320) so the forecast and volatility reflect the new regime and recent variability, improving service while controlling holding costs given high profit relative to holding cost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=506. Concluded arrivals across history consistently show a 3-period lead time (multiple P->P+3 observations) and several earlier delayed/lost shipments; set L=3 to reflect observed reality. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from demand history, which increases the base-stock to cover the longer lead and high profit/h holding tradeoff while leaving volatility estimation to the backend.

To protect service given confirmed LT=3 and recent moderate demand (~Periods19\u201323 avg ~86.6), set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the latest regime (Periods19\u201323) so the OR engine orders to cover (1+L) periods of current demand and captures recent volatility. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by focusing on recent demand and confirmed longer lead time while avoiding overstating demand from earlier higher regime periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=481 (some shipments delayed historically). Historical concluded lead times show consistent 3-period arrivals; demand history shows higher regime from Period_4 onward but recent observed sales are censored by stockouts. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent usable demand regime while limiting distortion from long-ago samples and stockouts. Sigma left as default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set. These choices aim to raise pipeline cover for the longer lead time while keeping demand forecast responsive to recent realized demand.

Historical conclude messages show multiple consistent 3-period arrivals (several P\u2192P+3 observations) and repeated lost/delayed earlier shipments \u2014 actual lead time stabilized at 3. To protect service while avoiding excessive holding cost I set lead time explicitly to 3. Demand appears to have shifted up since Period 4 and this regime has persisted; I use recent_N=20 to estimate (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent sustained regime (captures latest 20 samples). This increases safety stock to cover higher recent demand while sigma_recent adjusts dispersion for the OR backend's base-stock calculation.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical conclude messages show multiple consistent 3-period lead-time observations (P1->P4, P4->P7, etc.), and a sustained demand regime increase since Period 4. Therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect realized deliveries. For demand forecast and volatility, use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-change regime (long run since P4) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher mean and variability. This increases order targets to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while acknowledging holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19). No new carry-over insight to add.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time consistently = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations), so use L=3 to reflect true arrival lag. Recent demand (Periods 23\u201327 = 75,98,80,114,108) has mean=95; demand regime previously shifted upward, so use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to capture current regime ((1+L)\xd7mean will be computed by backend). Demand volatility should reflect the same recent window, so use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat. With L=3 (review+lead =4 periods) the backend will set base stock to cover ~4 periods of current demand; large in-transit (481) exceeds the (1+L)\xd7recent mean, so this will naturally suppress new orders and avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service under confirmed longer lead time.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=481. Concluded arrivals repeatedly show 3-period lead times (multiple P->P+3 observations across history), so use observed-average lead time. Recent demand (Periods 24\u201328 = 98,80,114,108,101) centers ~100; demand has returned to ~100 in latest five periods so use recent_N=5 for demand forecast and volatility to reflect the current regime. These choices align pipeline cover (1+L) periods and keep service while limiting holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Given consistent evidence of actual lead time = 3, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine forecasts across the correct lead window. Use default demand/volatility pooling ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full historical samples and balance service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31. On-hand=0, in-transit=481 \u2014 large pipeline but prior history shows many delayed/lost shipments and confirmed lead time = 3. Demand history exhibits a sustained higher regime since Period 4. I set L explicitly to 3 (confirmed by multiple conclude messages). For mu_hat I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the recent demand regime (N=20) so the (1+L)\xd7mean reflects current demand levels and avoids down-weighting recent higher demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=20) to capture recent variability. These choices make the OR backend target service using the empirically confirmed lead time and recent-demand statistics while avoiding understocking from old low-demand samples.

Given confirmed LT=3 and ongoing pipeline, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine sizes orders for the longer realized lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations (all samples) so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively, balancing service level against holding cost with the backend's base-stock formula.

Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). Use L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time so OR backend plans across correct pipeline horizon. Recent demand (Periods 24\u201332: 98,80,114,108,101,106,88,120,114) appears to be the current regime; use recent_N with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L) scaling uses the up-to-date mean and variability rather than outdated early-sample stats. This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by sizing base stock to recent demand while accounting for longer confirmed lead time and existing large in-transit volume.

Recent demand (Periods 29\u201333 = 106, 88, 120, 114, 117) has mean ~109; use a recent-window forecast to reflect current regime. Set L explicit=3 to capture confirmed longer lead time so the OR engine orders enough pipeline to cover the extra delay. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, preserving responsiveness to the observed ~110 demand level while the long lead time buffers service level versus holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical conclude messages (multiple periods) confirm actual lead time = 3. Recent history shows higher sustained demand vs earliest samples, and many past delayed/lost shipments; using an explicit lead time of 3 makes the OR backend size orders to cover the longer pipeline. I select default demand and volatility estimators so the backend uses all available demand history scaled by (1+L) to compute mu_hat and sqrt(1+L) scaling for sigma_hat; this balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given large in-transit and prior delivery delays.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. Demand recent regime has settled around ~103 units (mean of last 5 periods P31\u2013P35 = 102.8); I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat so backend computes (1+L)*recent mean, matching current demand. I use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices align pipeline coverage to (1+L) periods of current demand and compensate for missing shipments by using confirmed longer lead time.

I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the historical demand samples; given the confirmed lead-time shift, letting the backend compute demand across the review+lead period keeps parameters consistent with its capped ordering logic and the current large in-transit balance.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time (promised was 2 but evidence shows 3). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime using the last 5 observed demands (Periods 35\u201339: 68,102,107,126,118) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_recent and stays responsive to the raised demand level. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility rather than older low-variance samples. These choices ensure the OR backend raises base-stock to cover (L+1) periods at the current demand regime while accounting for observed longer lead time and recent variability; with high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) this leans toward higher service level but uses recent data to avoid overreacting to very old samples. I expect existing in-transit (481) to arrive under L=3 timing; no immediate extra explicit order sizing here\u2014backend will compute final order based on these parameters.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (multiple P->P+3 confirmations) and earlier lost shipments; therefore set lead time explicitly to 3. Recent demand has been ~102,107,126,118,88 (Periods 36\u201340), so I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture current regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to size order across review+lead. I also set sigma_hat based on recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. These choices prioritize service (given high profit $19 vs holding $1) while using recent demand to avoid overstock from stale older samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=491. Historical conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (multiple P->P+3 observations) and sustained delivery issues earlier. I therefore set lead time to explicit 3 to reflect confirmed actual LT. Demand recently averages ~107 units (Periods 37\u201341); to focus the forecast on the current regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std (backend will compute values). This raises target base-stock to cover the 4-period exposure while keeping volatility and service driven by recent demand, balancing service level (high profit/unit \u2192 q\u22480.95) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Recent demand ~100\u2013130 per period with no new sustained regime shift since earlier confirmed increase around Period 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=491 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show frequent 3-period deliveries; use observed lead-time averaging. To keep responsiveness to recent demand, forecast demand using the last 5 periods. Sigma uses recent 5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings let OR backend size base-stock to cover review+lead demand while capping order size given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical conclude messages show multiple consistent 3-period lead-time observations (several P->P+3 arrivals), and many earlier lost/delayed shipments\u2014so use a lead-time estimate based on observed behavior. Demand in recent periods (P40\u2013P43 demands: 88,94,108,121 and surrounding ~100\u2013126) is higher than the very early samples; to capture the current regime I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the most recent 5 demand observations) so the OR engine will target inventory that covers (1+L) periods of current demand and account for recent volatility. This balances service (prevent stockouts given long/confirmed lead time and large pipeline) against holding cost by not inflating forecasts using very old low-demand samples.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=0, in-transit=481. Historical concludes show multiple consistent 3-period arrivals (confirmed lead_time=3), so set L explicit=3. Recent demand around 100\u2013133; use recent_N (last 5 periods) to capture current regime (Period_40\u201344) where mean ~108.8 and variability representative. Choosing recent_N N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat provides (1+L)-period coverage while avoiding stale early-period zeros and earlier regime shifts. This balances service (covering 4 periods of demand with confirmed L=3) against holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. On-hand=0, in-transit=497. Historical conclude messages repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals), and there have been sustained delivery issues earlier. I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to align forecasting with observed arrivals. Use default demand/statistics aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided samples; with L=3 this covers the review+lead demand horizon while keeping volatility treatment standard. This balances service (matching observed 3-period lead time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand=0, in-transit=497 \u2014 substantial pipeline but no on-hand stock to meet current period demand. Historical conclude messages show multiple consistent 3-period arrivals (examples: P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P11->P14, P12->P15, P14->P17, P40->P43), so actual lead time is sustained at 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the engine balance profit vs holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time. This choice accounts for overdue/lost shipments by aligning planning lead time with observed arrivals and relying on the pipeline count (497) to be consumed over upcoming periods.

Historical conclude messages show multiple consistent 3-period arrivals (evidence across many periods), and many orders delayed/lost under promised 2-period lead time. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR backend sizes pipeline for (1+L) periods. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples \u2014 this leverages full sample history while the explicit L corrects for chronic delivery delays and reduces stockouts given the long in-transit pipeline.
