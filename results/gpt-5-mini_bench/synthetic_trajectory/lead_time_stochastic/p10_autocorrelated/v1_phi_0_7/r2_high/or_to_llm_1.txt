Do not record a carry-over insight. Demand stats (OR used historical samples): mean single-period \u03bc\u0304=86.4, sd \u03c3\u0304\u224812.26.

However OR's recommendation shown is 143; reconciling with simpler coverage logic: to cover expected (1+L)=3 periods demand \u03bc\u0302=259.2, we need total inventory (on-hand + in-transit + order) \u2248259.2. Given current on-hand+in-transit=142, additional required \u2248117.2. Rounding to integer, place 117 units. Reasoning for reducing versus OR: OR\u2019s cap/base-stock produced a higher long-run safety target, but much of that target is already in pipeline (127 units). With mixed evidence on lead time (not yet a sustained 3-period lead time) and large pipeline, ordering 117 units fills the gap to expected 3-period demand without overstocking and incurring extra holding cost.
