OR applies the cap (\u2248148) and outputs 149 (rounding).\nStep 2 \u2014 Lead-time & arrivals: No 'Period X conclude' messages exist yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; any order placed now may arrive as late as Period N+2 (promised) or be earlier/lost \u2014 unknown.\nStep 3 \u2014 Risk tradeoff: Expected demand over the (L+1)=3-period coverage window is ~279 units; OR caps to ~149 to limit exposure to high pipeline variance and holding cost. Without evidence of shorter lead time or regime shift, ordering much more risks incurring holding cost on slow arrivals or exposing us if the supplier loses shipments.\nDecision: Follow OR recommendation of 149 units. Rationale: OR already balances expected multi-period demand and caps extreme orders; with no concluded arrivals or sustained demand change signals, there is insufficient evidence to justify increasing above OR (risk of holding/lost shipments) or decreasing (we start at zero inventory). This preserves coverage if lead time is favorable while limiting downside.\n",

There is also evidence of lost/delayed shipments: the order placed in Period 2 (142 units) had no arrival by its expected arrival (would have shown in Period 5), indicating some orders are lost or severely delayed. Inventory & demand analysis: Historical single-period demand from samples = (61+107+84+144+69)/5 = 93 units.
