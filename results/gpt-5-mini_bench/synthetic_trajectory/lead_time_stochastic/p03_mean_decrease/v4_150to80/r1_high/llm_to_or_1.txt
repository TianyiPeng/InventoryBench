Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=2 and no evidence to contradict it, so keep L=default. Demand history (216,129,138,129,115) yields baseline forecast; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given no recent changepoint or lost-shipment signal.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. History: one order (212) placed Period_1 remains in-transit and Period_1 conclude shows arrived=0 (no concluded arrivals yet) so actual lead time is not confirmed. Demand samples (periods 1-5 provided historically) show mean demand = (216+129+138+129+115)/5 = 145.4, but only periods 1 conclude visible with demand=137; given lack of sustained lead-time evidence and single-period arrival uncertainty, use promised lead time (default) and default demand aggregation so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost while awaiting confirmed lead-time or loss signals.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision: promised lead time=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=416 (orders P1=212,P2=204). No concluded arrivals yet for those orders so actual lead time cannot be inferred (arrivals will appear in future conclude messages). Use default lead time to match promised L and let OR backend compute base stock from full-sample mean/variance. This keeps policy aligned with supplied statistics while awaiting arrival confirmations and avoids overreacting to unconfirmed delays.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=522. Historical demand samples available (216,129,138,129,115) and recent observed sold demands in concluded periods are low but noisy. No concluded arrivals have been observed for orders placed so far, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. To avoid overfitting to unconfirmed lead-time shifts and because we lack a confirmed changepoint in demand, I use the promised lead time (default) and the default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR engine working from its standard baseline while acknowledging potential delayed/lost shipments in the rationale.

Carry-over insight: No arrivals observed in Periods 1\u20133 despite repeated orders; order placed in Period_1 expected to have arrived by Period_3 did not\u2014evidence of delayed or lost shipments across first 3 periods.

Daily Profit: $3154.00, Daily Holding Cost: $152.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $3002.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Demand history (samples) shows moderate, stable demand; no calendar spikes. Inventory: on-hand=152, in-transit=204. Concluded arrivals reveal variable lead times (P1->P4 => 3, P3->P4 => 1). I choose L=calculate so backend uses observed lead times average (captures recent variability rather than blindly trusting promised 2). For demand forecast and volatility I use default methods so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), leveraging all available demand samples to smooth short-run noise. This balances service level (accounting for longer observed lead time) against holding cost given high profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: Period_1 order arrived in Period_4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2888.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision. Recent confirmed lead time = 3 periods (Period_1 order arrived in Period_4). On-hand=0, in-transit=398 \u2014 significant pipeline present from prior orders. Historical demand samples average 145.4 units/period; using confirmed L=3 implies (1+L)=4 review+lead window. I choose L explicitly=3 to reflect observed reality and ensure the OR engine plans for the longer delivery delay. For demand forecasting and variability I use 'default' rules so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which balances service level (through longer lead-time coverage) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=590. History shows delayed arrivals and a confirmed lead time of 3 periods (Period_1 order arrived in Period_4). To reflect observed reality, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative base-stock that covers the review+lead period and balances service vs holding costs given current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period_1 order arrived in Period_4).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=666. Concluded history shows multiple long delays and repeated confirmations that actual lead time is 3 periods (Period_1 order arrived in Period_4, confirmations through Period_7). Given strong, sustained evidence of LT=3 and large pipeline, set L explicitly to 3 to reflect reality and avoid under-ordering. Demand history (samples: 216,129,138,129,115) shows no sustained jump; use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, letting the engine account for the longer review+lead horizon. This balances higher safety stock for longer lead time while acknowledging large in-transit inventory to avoid excess new orders.

Daily Profit: $3211.00, Daily Holding Cost: $101.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $3110.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 (Period_1 order arrived in Period_4; Period_5 order arrived in Period_8). On-hand=101, in-transit=396 => pipeline + on-hand covers several periods but shipments have 3-period arrival delay. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time. Demand has recently averaged ~148 units (Periods 4-8: 166,152,136,118,169); with review+lead (1+L)=4 I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the backend forecasts 4\xd7recent mean and adapts to the latest regime. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility rather than older samples. These choices align orders with the confirmed longer lead time while keeping safety stock responsive to recent demand.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=0, in-transit=563. History shows multiple delayed arrivals with confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (Period_1\u2192arrived Period_4; Period_5\u2192arrived Period_8). To ensure pipeline covers the longer realized lead time and avoid stockouts while capping excess holding, I explicitly set L=3. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent regime and capture recent demand level while avoiding overreaction to single-period spikes. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the same recent window, aligning safety stock with recent variability. This combination addresses missing/delayed shipments by building inventory for the longer confirmed lead time and uses recent demand statistics to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=651; recent concludes show mixed lead times (observed W = 3,1,3,1 \u2192 average 2.0). Several earlier shipments experienced 3-period delays but some arrived in 1 period; using calculated average lead time (2) is conservative and matches promised lead time. Demand history available; use default demand estimation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting OR engine balance high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1). This handles in-transit pipeline while avoiding overreaction to intermittent 3-period delays or isolated fast arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period_12: recent concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (orders from P1 arrived in P4, repeated confirmations). On-hand=0, in-transit=668 (sufficient pipeline but delayed arrivals historically). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time. Demand has been stable recently but below early-sample levels; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime (most recent 5 demands) so the OR backend sizes base-stock and cap to current demand and variability while accounting for the longer lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: on-hand=49, in-transit=414. Historical concluded lead times observed = {3,1,3,1,3,2} (avg \u22482.17) with repeated 3-period arrivals and some 1\u20132 period variability and earlier lost/delayed shipments. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures confirmed 3-period tendency while accounting for shorter observations). For demand, use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this leverages full sample history given no strong, sustained shift in demand (only short fluctuations) and balances service level vs holding cost amid lead-time uncertainty.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (arrivals from orders placed in Period_1 and Period_5 arrived in Period_4 and Period_8 respectively). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=610 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrival timing follows L=3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time. Demand forecasting: no clear sustained demand regime shift since observations are mixed, so I use recent_N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 demand samples (reduces influence of older data). Similarly use recent_N=5 for sigma to capture recent volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock calculation with the empirically observed 3-period lead time and recent demand patterns while avoiding overreaction to isolated spikes or early-period anomalies.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=731. Recent concluded history shows multiple lead_time=3 observations (orders placed P1,P5,P9,P11 arrived after 3 periods) with occasional shorter arrivals \u2014 evidence that actual lead time is frequently 3. There is a large pipeline already, so avoid aggressive up-weighting of demand. I choose L by "calculate" so backend uses observed lead-time records to estimate the effective lead time. For demand I choose "default" for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L); this is conservative given the large in-transit volume and avoids overreacting to short-term variability.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=730. Historical conclude messages (Period_4,8,12,14,15) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods for multiple orders (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15). To ensure pipeline covers current demand + multi-period arrival delay, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the demand samples, giving conservative coverage under the longer confirmed lead time and balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand=115, in-transit=534. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (many P1/P5/P9/P11/P12/P13) with occasional 1\u20132 period anomalies; overall observed lead times average ~2.44. There is clear evidence of sustained longer lead time (~3) versus promised 2, so I let the backend compute average observed lead time (calculate) to capture that. For demand I use default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and default volatility to keep forecasts anchored to the full sample set given no sustained demand regime change. These settings raise replenishment cover to account for longer confirmed lead times while letting the OR engine trade service level vs. holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1347.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: recent arrivals show a sustained shift to 3-period lead time (most recent 5 observed lead_times = 3). On-hand=173 + in-transit=432 = 605 units, which covers ~4 periods of recent demand. I set L to recent_N to capture the confirmed 3-period regime. Demand has moderated recently (last 5 demands avg \u2248111), so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat (backend will apply (1+L) multiplier). Volatility also taken from the most recent 5 samples (recent_N N=5) to reflect current variation. These choices align pipeline targets with the confirmed lead-time and recent demand, avoiding overstock while maintaining service levels.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19: recent demand samples average ~145.4 units/period (samples: 216,129,138,129,115). On-hand=85, in-transit=432. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (Period_1 order arrived in Period_4, repeated confirmations). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time and avoid underestimating pipeline needs. I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples with L=3, balancing service level (through higher base-stock for longer lead time) against holding cost. This accounts for overdue/lost-shipment history by increasing the covered review+lead horizon.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: recent concluded history shows repeated 3-period arrivals (many P?.order -> P?.arrive with W=3) while some single shipments had shorter lags; average observed lead time ~2.5 but modal behavior is 3. On-hand=0, in-transit=588 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals are observed with a 1-period reporting delay. I set L by 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average lead time (captures the confirmed longer lead-time behavior). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding tradeoff) using the engine's base-stock formula while letting the engine cap orders based on its statistical cap.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time so the OR backend orders against the correct pipeline length.

Several early-period lost/delayed shipments were resolved, but pipeline is large now. I set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate) so the OR engine uses the empirical lead-time average. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given the estimated (longer) lead time and current large pipeline.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=667 \u2014 substantial pipeline but previous history shows arrivals often delayed with actual lead time = 3 periods. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time from concluded history. I use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) so the forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean reacts to the recent lower-demand regime and avoids over-ordering against stale high-demand samples. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so volatility matches recent variability. These choices reduce risk of excess holding given large in-transit volume and prior lost/delayed shipments while targeting service with the confirmed longer lead time.

On-hand=48, in-transit=588 \u2014 substantial pipeline but prior concludes confirm prolonged lead time behavior (multiple P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, etc.). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 3 periods; I set L=3 to reflect realized delivery timing so the backend sizes orders for a 3-period arrival window. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std based on all available demand samples; this balances higher safety stock for the longer confirmed lead time while letting the engine cap orders internally to avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit volume.

To protect service given confirmed longer lead time and moderate demand variability, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period demand.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: recent history shows repeated confirmed lead_time=3 (arrivals from Period_1 observed in Period_4 and again confirmed). On-hand=0, in-transit=642 (large pipeline of outstanding units). I set L explicitly to 3 based on multiple conclude messages confirming a 3-period lead time. Demand forecast (mu_hat) uses recent_N=5 (last 5 demand periods) scaled by (1+L) to capture the current lower-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. With L=3 this (1+L)=4 review+lead horizon keeps the order policy responsive to the most recent demand regime while the large in-transit volume reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=642. Historical conclude messages (Periods 4,8,12,16,17,23 etc.) repeatedly show arrivals with lead_time=3; prior missing arrivals confirm shipments commonly take 3 periods. To ensure the OR backend accounts for observed slower deliveries, I set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand forecast and volatility I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of historical samples (uses all samples) \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost while letting the backend compute safety stock given the explicit longer lead time. This choice addresses delayed shipments by increasing the review+lead demand coverage without over-customizing demand estimates here.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: recent concluded history shows frequent 3-period actual lead times (many observes) with occasional 1\u20132 period anomalies; current on-hand=0, in-transit=642 (large pipeline). To avoid over-ordering given large pipeline and confirmed longer lead-time signal, set L to be computed from observed lead times (backend average). Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine's cap and base-stock formula temper orders against the big in-transit position and holding cost.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=642. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P11\u2192P14, P20\u2192P23). There is strong, sustained evidence actual lead time is 3 (delayed vs promised). I set L explicit=3 to align the OR engine's review+lead forecasting with observed delays. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses all demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L); this provides a conservative base-stock covering current demand plus the confirmed longer lead time and balances service level vs. holding cost given high in-transit exposure.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=642. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple confirmed: e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, etc.); earlier missing arrivals indicate past lost/delayed shipments but recent pattern supports LT\u22483. I select L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times from concluded history. Demand samples show variable demand; no clear sustained demand regime shift detected, so use default demand estimators (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service (capturing the longer inferred lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit position.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32: recent demand has been moderate (last 5 periods demand = 81,108,43,87,83; mean=80.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=642 (large pipeline). Multiple concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed deliveries and avoid under-ordering due to persistent 3-period arrivals. Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the most recent regime (mean=80.4 \u2192 backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent demand volatility. These choices align ordering with the confirmed longer lead time while letting the OR engine cap orders given the large in-transit stock to limit holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=642. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, etc.). Demand recent run (Periods 29\u201332 = 43,87,83,91) has mean ~76. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR backend plans across the correct pipeline. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current lower-demand regime (4-period review+lead aggregation). Sigma is set recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices align orders with the large in-transit position and recent lower demand, limiting excess holding while preserving service over the 4-period coverage (1+L).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=642. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated lead_time=3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P11\u2192P14), and multiple earlier missed arrivals consistent with longer-than-promised transit. I set L via calculate so the backend uses observed lead-time history (captures confirmed 3-period behavior). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this leverages full historical demand while the calculated L accounts for delayed/lost shipments, balancing service level against holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Historical conclude messages repeatedly show orders arriving 3 periods after placement (confirmed lead_time=3 across multiple earlier periods) and earlier missing arrivals\u2014so use explicit L=3 to reflect realized lead time. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting it incorporate the full history while using the corrected lead time.

Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times (reflects persistent 3-period behavior). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), balancing service level vs holding cost without overfitting recent zero-arrival noise. This addresses missing/delayed shipments by relying on observed lead-time statistics rather than the promised value.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand = 0, in-transit = 642 which provides substantial coverage vs. typical demand. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=3). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes demand across (1+L) review+lead period using all samples; this balances service level given confirmed longer lead time while letting OR engine apply its capped order logic given the large in-transit pipeline.

Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (last 5 observed demands) and compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std accordingly.

Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (Period_1 order arrived in Period_4 and repeated confirmations). On-hand=0, in-transit=642 \u2014 large pipeline exists but arrivals are delayed by one extra period versus promised. Set L explicitly to 3 to match observed reality. Demand in recent periods (Periods 30\u201338) is lower and stable; I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. These parameters align the backend base-stock calculation with confirmed lead time and recent demand, avoiding underordering while controlling holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period_40 with on-hand=0, in-transit=642. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period deliveries (multiple confirmed P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, etc.), so actual lead time is longer than promised and dominated by 3. Use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand has been stable/moderate in recent long tail (many periods ~60\u2013100), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) to let the OR engine set base stock given the inferred lead time and avoid overfitting recent noise. This balances service level (higher L) against holding cost while accounting for large in-transit position.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: recent demand (Periods 36\u201340) is ~74\u201398 units/period; on-hand=0, in-transit=642 (sizable pipeline). Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (orders placed earlier arrived after 3). To reflect the confirmed longer lead time I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower/stable regime (recent mean ~76) across the review+lead window (1+L periods). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These parameters make the backend compute a base stock sized for the 4-period demand regime while using recent variability to avoid overstock given the large pipeline already in-transit.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (multiple confirmed arrivals from early orders). Recent demand has settled lower than early-period peaks; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 37\u201341 = 81,98,65,61,32) average ~67 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=642 (ample pipeline covering many periods). To reflect confirmed longer lead time and recent lower demand I set L explicitly to 3 and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility; this reduces overstating demand versus using all-sample averages and avoids creating excessive future orders given the large in-transit volume.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid under-ordering. Recent demand since mid-run has been lower and more volatile than early samples; to capture current regime I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples, balancing service level against holding costs given large in-transit stock.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent demand has been low-to-moderate with many zero-order periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=642 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (orders from earlier periods arrived after 3). To ensure the OR engine accounts for observed lead-time, I set L explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (conservative use of full history given sporadic ordering). This balances service (use longer L to size safety stock) against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

To ensure pipeline coverage and account for observed 3-period lead time, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples\u2014this balances service level (profit>>holding cost) while letting OR engine apply its z* sizing.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: recent realized lead time = 3 periods (confirmed in prior concludes). On-hand=0, in-transit=642 \u2014 substantial pipeline likely from earlier orders. Demand has been lower and more stable in recent periods (Periods 26\u201345) versus initial training samples, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (last 20 demand periods) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent regime; this balances service (use observed longer lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 47: on-hand=0, in-transit=642. Historical conclues show consistent actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, etc.). Use explicit L=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid under-ordering. Recent demand (Periods 42\u201346 = 119,57,138,79,77) averages \u224894; demand regime has been lower than early-sample bursts, so use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current mean over the review+lead horizon (1+L periods). Volatility appears moderate in the last 5 periods; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent variability. This balances service (with longer actual lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit position.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=0, in-transit=642. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 (orders from P1 arrived in P4 and repeated confirmations); shipments previously promised L=2 have behaved as L=3. To ensure pipeline coverage I set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, preserving statistical grounding while accounting for longer lead time and avoiding understock given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. History shows multiple concluded arrivals that consistently imply actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16). On-hand=0, in-transit=642 (large pipeline arriving later). To capture the confirmed longer lead time I set L explicit=3. Demand has recently averaged ~94 units over the last 5 periods (P44\u2013P48 = 138,79,77,97,79); using recent_N=5 for mu_hat gives (1+L)\xd7recent_mean to cover review+lead demand and keep service given long lead time. Demand volatility is best estimated from the same recent window, so sigma_hat recent_N=5. These settings prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while acknowledging the long confirmed lead time and existing in-transit stock.
