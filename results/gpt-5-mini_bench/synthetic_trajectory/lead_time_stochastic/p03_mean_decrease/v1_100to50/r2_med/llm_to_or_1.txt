  Mean: 109.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical demand samples mean = 109 units/period (Periods 1\u20135). I use the promised lead time (default L=2) because there is no evidence of delays or losses yet. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select default methods so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples\u2014this targets coverage of the next (L+1)=3 periods of demand while letting the OR engine trade off service vs. holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=133 (order placed P1 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals beyond Period_1, so insufficient evidence to change promised lead time (no sustained or 3+ period signal). Use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates based on all available samples to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost while awaiting confirmed arrivals; the in-transit 133 will be accounted for by the backend when computing pipeline coverage.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=266 (two prior orders of 133 each), expected arrivals will occur during Period_3 arrival phase but will only be visible in a Period_3 conclude message read at Period_4 \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so do NOT infer lost shipments or lead-time change. Demand history available; no sustained changepoint (only two concluded periods with lower-than-historical samples). Use promised lead time and default demand aggregation so backend uses full sample set to compute base-stock and caps, balancing service level vs holding cost conservatively while awaiting arrival confirmation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=338. One past order (Period_1) has not concluded (arrived=0) so shipment delays possible but insufficient evidence to change lead time yet. Use promised lead time to let OR engine account for expected pipeline. Demand baseline from provided samples has mean=109 units/period -> (1+L)*mean = 3*109 = 327 expected demand over review+lead; in-transit (338) slightly exceeds that, so do not inflate forecast. Chosen methods: keep L as default (promised=2), use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $630.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5): [118,124,116,96,91], mean=109. Observed arrivals show variable lead times: Period1 order arrived in Period4 (lead_time=3), Period3 order arrived in Period4 (lead_time=1) \u2014 evidence of unstable/longer-than-promised lead times and an overdue Period2 order still in-transit (133 units). On-hand=38 + in-transit=133. I select L by "calculate" to let the backend average observed lead times (captures the observed 3 and 1). For demand forecast I choose "default" so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) which uses all data (stable short history) and scales for the computed lead+review period. For sigma_hat I choose "default" so variability uses all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (using calculated longer lead time) against holding cost by increasing cover for the longer effective lead time while relying on full-sample stats to avoid overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6. Recent demand samples show mean ~109 with no clear regime shift; on-hand=0, in-transit=286 (several past orders still outstanding). Observed concluded lead times: order on P1 arrived P4 (LT=3), order on P3 arrived P4 (LT=1) \u2192 average LT=2. Use L='calculate' to let backend set L=avg observed. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level against holding cost given uncertain/variable lead times and substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7. On-hand=0, in-transit=438. Recent observed lead times (from concluded arrivals): 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4); average used via calculate to let backend infer current effective L. Demand has been variable with a spike at Period_4 but no sustained regime shift; using recent_N (N=3: Periods 4-6 demands 167,122,73) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the latest demand level and volatility across the most recent periods. These parameters bias orders toward meeting near-term demand while accounting for current pipeline, helping the OR engine balance service level (via recent demand mean) against holding cost (via using recent volatility and backend cap).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=562, recent demands = [118,124,116,96,91] (mean=109). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: order from P1 arrived in P4 (lead_time=3) and order from P3 arrived in P4 (lead_time=1). Average of observed lead times = 2, so use calculated lead time to reflect observed variability. Use default demand sizing (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std given the inferred L; this balances service level vs holding cost while letting the OR engine apply its capped ordering logic against the large in-transit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent concluded history shows intermittent arrivals with observed lead times of 1 and 3 (avg 2). Current on-hand=172 and in-transit=285 (pipeline+on-hand=457) which comfortably covers expected demand over review+lead period. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 1/3 bimodal pattern as avg=2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this is appropriate because demand samples (118,124,116,96,91) show no sustained upward/downward regime shift and current pipeline is ample. These choices balance service (keeping stock for variable lead times) against holding cost by relying on data-driven base-stock sizing.

Carry-over insight: Lead time observed as bimodal (1 and 3 periods); evidence: P1->P4 (3), P3->P4 (1), P5->P8 (3), P7->P8 (1).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=30, in-transit=316 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are bimodal (1 and 3) but average = 2 \u2192 use calculate for L so backend uses observed mean. Demand has shifted recently (higher variability and larger peaks in Periods 4\u20139); to capture current regime use recent_N on last 6 concluded demand samples (Periods 4\u20139) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. With a large pipeline, this avoids over-ordering while the recent_N forecast keeps service for the recent higher demand. Methods chosen balance service level (capture recent demand mean/volatility) against holding cost given inventory already in transit.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: recent demand has risen vs initial five-sample baseline (P4+ show higher demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=495 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times are bimodal (1 and 3); average = 2 so use calculated lead time to reflect observed mix. For demand I detect a regime change starting Period_4; I use recent_N (N=7, periods 4\u201310) to capture the higher recent mean when computing (1+L)\xd7mean, so the OR engine will raise the base-stock to cover elevated demand while pipeline is accounted for. I also apply recent_N (N=7) for sigma to reflect current volatility. This balances higher service level against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: observed lead times in concluded history are bimodal (1 and 3) but average to 2 \u2192 use calculated average lead time. Recent demand shows a modestly higher regime; last 5 demands (Periods 7\u201311 = 140,105,142,146,77) avg \u2248122. With L=2, review+lead horizon =3 periods, (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248366 units. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=564 >> 366 so pipeline comfortably covers expected demand; using recent_N for mu and sigma anchors forecast to current regime while OR backend cap will limit order size to avoid excess holding. Methods chosen: L via calculate (average observed lead times); mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect latest demand; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=128, in-transit=354. Historical concluded lead times = {3,1,3,1,3,2} (avg\u22482.17) showing variability around promised 2. Use L.method="calculate" so backend averages observed lead times. Demand samples are limited and no clear sustained demand regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level (captures observed longer-than-promised lead times) while avoiding overfitting short-term demand noise; defaults keep orders stable given large pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5 historically provided) show moderate demand with no clear sustained shift; current on-hand=37, in-transit=364 which is ample pipeline. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times of 1\u20133 periods (observed lead times: 3,1,3,1,3,2 \u2192 avg \u22482.17). I set L=calculate so the backend uses the observed average lead time. With large pipeline and no confirmed demand regime change, use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine balances service level and holding costs using full historical statistics rather than short recent windows.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=34, in-transit=381. Historical arrivals show majority lead time = 3 (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14) with occasional 1 or 2; this implies promised L=2 is optimistic and some shipments take 3 periods. I set L explicitly to 3 to ensure the OR engine plans for the longer effective pipeline. Demand samples (118,124,116,96,91) show no recent sustained demand regime shift, so I use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which scale appropriately for L=3. This raises base-stock to cover the longer coverage window and reduces stockout risk given large in-transit but delayed arrivals while still using observed demand variability to limit excess holdings.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed arrivals: P1->P4 (3), P5->P8 (3), P9->P12 (3), P11->P14 (3); other observations include P3->P4 (1) and P10->P12 (2))

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=446. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 3 periods recently (see Periods 1->4,5->8,9->12,11->14,15 confirms). To ensure coverage over the review+lead window and given confirmed longer lead time, I set L explicit=3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (leveraging full sample set to stabilize estimates). This keeps target base-stock responsive to the confirmed 3-period lead time while relying on full-sample volatility to avoid overreacting to short-term noise. High in-transit (446) will be accounted for by the pipeline deduction in the ordering rule.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17 start. Recent concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times (P13->P16, P11->P14, P5->P8, P1->P4) so actual lead time is persistently 3. On-hand=0, in-transit=469 (large pipeline arriving in future periods). I choose L="calculate" so backend uses observed lead-times average (captures confirmed 3-period reality). For demand I choose mu_hat="default" to use (1+L)*mean(all samples) \u2014 stable historical mean (samples: 118,124,116,96,91) is appropriate given no sustained demand regime change. For sigma_hat I choose "default" to let backend scale historical std by sqrt(1+L). These settings align ordering with the confirmed longer lead time while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock beyond what the OR engine computes; large pipeline reduces immediate need to inflate mu_hat or sigma_hat.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=52, in-transit=355. Historical concludes show a sustained lead-time=3 signal (Period 15 summary and multiple P->P+3 arrivals: P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14). Given confirmed LT=3, I set L explicitly to 3 to ensure pipeline planning accounts for the longer arrival lag. Use default demand methods (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, providing coverage over the 4-period review+lead horizon and balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=0, in-transit=416. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time settled at 3 periods; large pipeline exists from prior orders. To avoid underordering given long confirmed lead time, set L explicit=3. Use recent demand to capture current regime and variability (last 10 concluded demands) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent demand (including recent spikes and declines) across the (1+L) review+lead window. This balances service (avoid stockouts with long LT and high pipeline) against holding cost by relying on recent demand statistics rather than long-ago samples.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Recent demand has fallen from earlier highs; last 5 demands (P15-P19)=110,82,67,70,49 (mean\u224875.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=425 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers multiple periods but some past shipments showed delayed (bimodal) lead times and several confirmed 3-period arrivals. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed sustained lead-time shift to 3 (avoids under-ordering). I set mu_hat recent_N N=5 to base the (1+L)\xd7forecast on the most recent regime (captures the recent lower demand mean). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize matching pipeline to the longer confirmed lead time while keeping target stock sized to the recent lower demand to limit holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed arrivals: P1->P4 (3), P5->P8 (3), P9->P12 (3), P11->P14 (3))

Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service level using the observed L while letting OR use full-sample statistics. This addresses potential lost/delayed shipments by aligning promised L to observed arrivals, and leverages the large in-transit volume toward upcoming demand coverage.

Period_23: on-hand=0, in-transit=449. Historical concluded arrivals strongly support a persistent 3-period lead time (carry-over confirms lead time = 3). Recent observed demand baseline from provided samples has mean ~109 per period. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR backend sizes pipeline for the longer arrival delay. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (conservative use of full-sample stats given no new sustained demand regime change). This balances service (covering 4 periods of demand during the 3-period lead time) versus holding cost while accounting for the confirmed longer lead time and large in-transit pipeline.

Period_24: on-hand=0, in-transit=425. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations through Period 20). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) based on all provided samples: default computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which yields a 4-period demand forecast and scaled volatility. Given large in-transit pipeline, this keeps ordering conservative (avoids double-ordering lost shipments) while the base-stock formula will trade profit ($4) vs holding ($1) through the backend's service-level cap.

Period_26: recent demand samples (Periods 1\u201325) have mean ~106 and std ~18 (see history). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 \u2014 large pipeline likely contains multiple outstanding orders with observed arrivals showing consistent 3-period lead-time in recent history. Many past orders experienced lead_time=3 (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14) so use explicit L=3 to reflect operational reality and avoid under-ordering. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, which balances service (higher base_stock with L=3) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory. This approach is conservative about lead time, acknowledges overdue/lost shipment risk, and relies on full-sample demand stats rather than short-window noise.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 3 in recent confirmed observations (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14) and many subsequent periods with no same-period arrivals, so I set L explicit=3 to reflect actual experienced lead time. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) (captures full review+lead demand given L=3). Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This prioritizes covering the longer observed pipeline while letting OR engine apply its service-level cap to limit overordering given holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concludes show consistent 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14) and carry-over confirms lead time = 3; several earlier 1-2 period events appear isolated. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Recent demand has downshifted vs. early periods (most recent 5 demands: P23-P27 = 43,33,33,49,54; mean \u224842.4), so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility to the current lower regime. This balances service (using confirmed L) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Recent conclude history shows multiple confirmed 3-period lead time observations (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14) and prolonged gaps consistent with L=3; large pipeline (431) suggests incoming coverage. To align OR engine (which assumes promised lead time) with observed reality, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples, producing a base-stock appropriate for the 4-period demand window while the explicit L accounts for observed delays and avoids underordering against the large in-transit volume.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show lead time has repeatedly been 3 periods since Period 15; recent demand since Period 20 is substantially lower than early-sample mean (recent 10-period mean \u224844 units/period). To avoid overstocking given long pipeline and lower recent demand, set lead time explicit=3 (confirmed), forecast demand using recent_N over the last 10 periods to capture the new low-demand regime, and set sigma to recent_N (last 10) to reflect current volatility. These choices reduce target base stock relative to early high-demand samples and mitigate holding cost given heavy in-transit inventory.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1-20) and carry-over notes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods; use explicit L=3. Recent demand has fallen and become more volatile (last 5 demands: P26-P30 = 49,54,31,56,22), and with a large pipeline I reduce forecast scope to recent behavior to avoid excess holding cost. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture current lower mean over the upcoming review+lead horizon, and set sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (using confirmed L=3) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 3 in recent confirmed observations (Periods 1->4,5->8,9->12,11->14, etc.). To ensure pipeline coverage I set L explicitly to 3. I use default demand sizing so backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the OR engine apply its capped ordering policy while accounting for the longer observed lead time and current large in-transit volume.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=431 (large pipeline). Given confirmed sustained lead-time=3, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine forecasts over the correct lead period. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from historical samples; this leverages all available demand history while the large in-transit pipeline will be capped by the OR engine, avoiding over-ordering. No new shipment-loss signal detected.

Historical conclude messages (multiple periods including P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods; use explicit L=3 so orders target the correct pipeline coverage. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the OR engine balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) via its native z* computation. This preserves service with minimal extra holding given large pipeline.

Historical concluded arrivals show sustained lead time=3 evidence through Period 20 (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14) and no new sustained contrary pattern since. To ensure pipeline covers true arrival lag, set L explicitly=3. Use default demand estimates so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples scaled by (1+L)=4; this balances service level given high in-transit volume while avoiding manual over-adjustment. This choice also accounts for missing recent concludes by conservatively treating lead time as 3 rather than the promised 2.

Given the confirmed shift to 3-period lead time and large in-transit pipeline, set L explicitly to 3 to align ordering horizon with observed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this leverages full history while the explicit L corrects for persistent lead-time change and prevents over-ordering despite the large pipeline.

To ensure pipeline coverage and reflect confirmed longer lead time, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances higher safety stock (covering 4 periods) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm a 3-period lead time (multiple P->P+3 observations through Period 20). Demand recent trend (last 5 periods: P33-P37 = 31,25,55,61,63) averages ~47 units/period. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid underordering given delayed arrivals. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the current lower-moderate demand regime (captures recent mean \u224847; (1+L)*mean \u2248188). I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility for safety stock. These choices prioritize matching pipeline to a 3-period arrival pattern while avoiding excess inventory from older high-demand samples; they also account for the large in-transit volume when OR computes final order.

Current on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded lead-time evidence (Periods 1->4,5->8,9->12,11->14 etc.) confirms actual lead time is 3 periods, so set L explicitly to 3. With a long in-transit pipeline (431) and modest per-period demand history, use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this avoids overfitting to short-term noise while the large in-transit reduces immediate need for aggressive orders. This balances service level (accounting for confirmed LT=3) against holding cost given substantial incoming inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean=109 units; current on-hand=0 with large in-transit=431 (many prior orders outstanding). Historical concluded arrivals overwhelmingly indicate a 3-period lead time (multiple P->P+3 observations); shipments have been delayed relative to promised 2. To reflect confirmed longer lead time I set L explicit=3. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples (conservative pooling given limited samples). This increases target base stock to cover 4 periods of demand and raises safety stock for higher service given observed delays while relying on backend cap to limit excessive ordering.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42. On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations). Recent demand (Periods ~19-41) is materially lower than initial sample set; to reflect the current lower-regime demand I use a recent window. Set L explicit=3 to match confirmed lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 demand observations so the OR backend sizes orders to current demand while capping order size via its cap parameter to avoid excess inventory given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical small-sample mean demand=109 (samples: 118,124,116,96,91). Multiple concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 3 (sustained evidence in history). Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed 3-period arrivals and avoid under-ordering. Forecast (review+lead) demand = (1+L)*mean = 4*109 = 436 units, set mu_hat explicit to ensure backend targets sufficient pipeline. Demand volatility estimated from samples: std\u224813.03, scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2 \u2192 sigma\u224826.05, set sigma_hat explicit to size safety stock. These explicit settings reconcile pipeline (431 in-transit) with expected arrivals and prioritize avoiding stockouts given confirmed longer lead time while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=458. Historical conclude messages show sustained evidence that actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple arrivals matching 3). To avoid over-ordering while acknowledging long pipeline I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine forecasts across the correct review+lead horizon. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which keeps forecasts tied to full history and balances service level vs holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45. Recent demand (Periods 40-44 = 63,36,59,48,42) averages ~49.6 units/period. Pipeline has 458 units and on-hand 0. Carry-over history confirms lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded observations P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14). With L=3, review+lead horizon = 4 periods \u2192 forecast demand ~4\xd749.6=198.4. Pipeline (458) comfortably exceeds this forecast, so parameters should reflect the 3-period lead-time and recent demand regime to avoid overstocking. I choose L explicit=3 (confirmed by concluded arrivals), mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to anchor to the most recent regime, and sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These settings tell the OR engine to size the base stock for a 4-period demand forecast based on the latest demand pattern while recognizing confirmed longer lead time.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:

Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid under-ordering given long arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this leverages full history for stable forecasts while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and helps balance service level versus holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concludes (through P46) show lead time persistently 3 in recent confirmed observations. Demand has shifted down from early high-100s to ~30-70 range for many periods (sustained lower regime since ~P20). To reflect confirmed LT=3 and the recent lower-demand regime I set L explicitly to 3 and use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility to capture the last ~20 periods of realized demand (stable low-demand regime). This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to current lower demand while accounting for pipeline (large in-transit) and the longer confirmed lead time to avoid over-ordering and high holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=3 in multiple periods (e.g., P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14) and later history remains consistent with multi-period arrivals; choose explicit L=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=431\u2014pipeline is substantial so use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let OR backend compute base stock and cap appropriately while avoiding unnecessary manual tuning.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. On-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has repeatedly been 3 periods (Periods 1->4,5->8,9->12,11->14) and later confirmations through Period 20; recent arrivals include a 2-period event but the dominant sustained pattern is LT=3. Recent demand (Periods 44-48: 42,57,15,74,72) has mean ~52; using a recent_N forecast captures current regime. Therefore: set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the (1+L)\xd7mean on the latest demand regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (by inflating lead time and using recent demand mean) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and limited on-hand stock.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently observed as 3 periods (multiple confirmed observations through Period 20). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR engine plans for the longer pipeline. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat leverages all provided demand samples (mean=109 over samples) scaled by (1+L) to cover the review+lead period; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.
