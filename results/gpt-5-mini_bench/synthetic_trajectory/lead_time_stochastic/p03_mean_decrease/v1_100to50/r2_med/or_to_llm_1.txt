Step 2 - Inventory balance vs. demand: On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical single-period demands (given earlier) average ~109 (118,124,116,96,91 -> mean 109). The OR recommended 12 units using its base-stock cap, but that policy assumes the usual pipeline and lead time; here pipeline=327 is already very large and will cover many future periods (327 / ~109 \u2248 3.0 single-periods, or more if current observed demand stays near Period 1's 83). Step 3 - Risk of overstock: Holding cost is $1/unit/period while profit is $4/unit; excess ordering now would increase holding costs and reduce R_t. There's only one recent low-demand observation (Period 1 demand=83), not a sustained regime shift (insufficient evidence per carry-over rules). Step 4 - Decision: Do not follow OR's add-on of 12 units; place order=0 to avoid increasing pipeline and holding costs.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "History shows actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P42\u2192P45). Recent demand (Periods 45\u201349 = 57,15,74,72,44) averages ~52.4 units/period. With confirmed L=3, we need (L+1)=4 periods coverage \u2248 210 units. Current on-hand = 0 but in-transit = 460 units \u2014 which comfortably covers ~8.8 periods at recent demand rates. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs. profit $4; excess inventory is costly, but given in-transit already en route and reliable recent arrivals, placing additional order risks unnecessary holding cost. OR recommends 0 units; I agree and place 0. I remain conservative because prior lost shipment events existed early on, but recent consistent 3-period arrivals (including large P42\u2192P45) increase confidence in the pipeline. No new sustained demand or lead-time shifts detected that would warrant overriding OR.",
