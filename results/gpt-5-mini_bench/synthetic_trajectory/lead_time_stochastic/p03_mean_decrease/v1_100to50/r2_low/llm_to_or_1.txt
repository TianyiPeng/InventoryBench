  Mean: 109.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical sample mean demand = 109 units/period (5 samples). Promised lead time used because no observed lead-time data. Using default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) keeps the OR backend's baseline forecast consistent with observed history while avoiding overfitting to very recent noise. This balances service (covering 3 periods of expected demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=133 from order placed Period 2 decision (observed as ordered=133 in Period 1 conclude with arrived=0). No concluded arrivals yet => cannot infer actual lead time (need arrivals in conclude messages). Promised lead time is 2; demand history (Periods 1-5) shows mean ~109. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding so q=0.5), use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies its base-stock with full-sample statistics. This keeps parameters conservative given in-transit units and uncertain lead-time/possible lost shipments.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=266 (two previous orders of 133 each) and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 this is consistent with promised lead time=2 (orders placed in P1/P2 would conclude later). Recent demand history shows no sustained regime change (samples: 118,124,116,96,91). No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time shift based on concluded messages. Use default lead time and population statistics so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively given no confirmed changepoints and current pipeline short of the (1+L)-period demand forecast.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: observed three consecutive conclude messages (Periods 1\u20133) showing zero arrivals for orders placed in those periods, so shipments are likely delayed or lost. I set L explicitly to 3 to be conservative (accounts for extended lead time/lost shipments) so the OR backend plans for a longer pipeline. Demand stats are not clearly regime-shifted yet, so mu_hat and sigma_hat use default methods ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the backend compute forecasts and safety stock with the longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed missing/delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 (133, 133, 50) have not arrived by their promised arrival windows (arrived=0 in Periods 1\u20133 conclude); suggests actual lead time >2 or lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $167.00, Daily Holding Cost: $16.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $151.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. On-hand=16, in-transit=239. Concluded arrivals show orders: P1\u2192P4 (lead_time=3) and P3\u2192P4 (lead_time=1); observed lead times = {3,1} so average actual lead time = 2 \u2192 use calculate. Several earlier orders were delayed (missing/delayed shipments), so I rely only on concluded lead-time evidence rather than assuming promised L=2 or lost shipments. Use default demand/volatility (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine recomputes mu_hat and sigma_hat incorporating the chosen L; this balances service (via base-stock quantile) against holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=392. Observed concluded arrivals show lead times of 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4); average = 2, so use calculate for L. Recent demand shows an uptick in periods 4\u20135; use recent_N (N=3: periods 3\u20135) for mu_hat to capture the higher recent mean and for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This balances higher short-term demand (raise base stock) while reflecting current pipeline (in-transit) and addressing prior missing/delayed shipments by using observed lead-time average.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=528. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135): [118,124,116,96,91] with recent demands falling slightly. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead-times (observed W=3 for P1\u2192P4 and W=1 for P3\u2192P4); use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume and uncertain lead-time pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $106.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=422. History shows orders that were promised L=2 often arrived after 3 periods (Period1\u2192Period4, Period4\u2192Period7) with one shorter arrival (Period3\u2192Period4 =1). This indicates lead-time has shifted upward and recent evidence (two 3-period arrivals) dominates. I choose L as recent_N (last 3 observed lead times) so the backend averages recent observed lead times. Demand history (samples provided) shows no sustained multi-period demand regime change \u2014 recent spikes (P4=167, P7=140) are intermittent \u2014 so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the backend use the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). These choices increase target pipeline to cover longer actual lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-lived demand spikes.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period4, Period4 order arrived in Period7; observed lead times include [3,1,3], two recent 3-period arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=48, in-transit=296. History shows observed lead times = [3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P4->P7), 3 (P5->P8)] with two recent 3s indicating a shift toward 3-period deliveries. Demand recent sequence (P4\u2013P8) = [167,122,73,140,105]. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to emphasize the most recent lead-time behavior (favoring 3). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest demand regime across the full recent window (covers review+lead period). Volatility uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias orders toward covering the longer observed lead time while using recent demand to avoid overstock from older high spikes.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=411. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = [3,1,3,3,1] (avg ~2.2) and recent demand has been volatile with higher spikes (Periods 5-9: 122,73,140,105,142). There is no new sustained anomaly beyond previously noted delayed shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times (captures actual > promised). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the most recent 5 periods (captures the current regime with spikes). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the recent higher/variable demand while the lead-time estimate accounts for longer/mixed arrival patterns, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: recent demand has been high and volatile (last 5 demands: 73,140,105,142,146). On-hand=0, in-transit=447 (large pipeline likely contains multiple shipments with mixed lead times). Observed lead times from concluded messages = [3,1,3,3,1]; recent evidence shows predominantly 3-period arrivals. To be responsive to the recent lead-time regime and recent demand surge, I set L using recent observed lead times (N=5) and estimate demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) from the most recent 5 demand periods so the OR backend targets a base-stock that covers (1+L) periods of the current demand level while accounting for recent variability and overdue/lost shipment risk.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: demand has been variable recently (P7\u2013P11 = 140,105,142,146,77). On-hand=0, in-transit=447. Historical conclude messages show most observed lead times = 3 (observed sequence 3,1,3,3,1) and prior carry-over already flagged lead_time=3; recent behaviour still supports a 3-period lead. I set L using recent_N to capture the most recent lead-time evidence. For demand I use recent_N (last 5 periods, P7\u2013P11) so mu_hat reflects the current regime (mean \u2248122) and (1+L) coverage; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices aim to size orders to cover the next (1+L)=4 periods of demand based on recent demand while acknowledging the longer observed lead time and avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (observed lead times include 3,1,3,3,1,3,2) \u2014 overall average > promised 2, indicating longer/variable lead time.

Demand samples provided are limited, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let OR backend compute base-stock while the larger L increases pipeline coverage to guard against delayed arrivals and balance service vs holding cost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 14. Recent concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) despite promised L=2; pipeline is large (on-hand=5, in-transit=315). I set L explicit=3 to reflect the persistent 3-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime: recent demands (Periods 9\u201313 = 142,146,77,82,91) have mean \u2248107.6; mu_hat uses the last 5 samples to focus orders on current demand. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings align the base-stock (and cap) with observed longer lead times and current demand while avoiding excess ordering given the large pipeline.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_15. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = [3,1,3,3,1,3,2] (avg \u22482.29) with multiple recent 3-period arrivals, so actual lead time appears > promised 2. I select L='calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135: 118,124,116,96,91) show no sustained mean shift; I'll use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine scales base stock to the inferred lead time. Note on inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=426 (large pipeline) \u2014 using calculated L with default mu/sigma lets backend cap ordering to avoid excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=426. Historical conclues show frequent 3-period arrivals (Periods 1\u21924,4\u21927,9\u219212,5\u21928) so actual lead time \u22483; several earlier delays/losses resolved but pipeline large. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time so the OR engine will size pipeline to cover (1+L) future demand. Recent demand (last 5 periods: P11\u2013P15 = [77,82,91,72,110]) appears representative; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture current mean and scale by (1+L). I also use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given long lead time and large pipeline) while keeping holding costs constrained by using a short recent window rather than all-history smoothing.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: On-hand=0, in-transit=380. Concluded arrivals show mostly 3-period lead times recently, but observed lead times sequence (chronological) = [3,1,3,3,1,3,2,3]; recent average (last 5) = 2.4, so actual lead time is variable but trending >=2. I choose L via recent_N (N=5) to capture recent lead-time behavior. Demand has stepped around the high 70s\u2013110s in the last 5 periods (P12\u2013P16 demands = [82,91,72,110,82], mean\u224887.4); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, balancing service level against $1 holding cost by relying on recent demand and lead-time evidence. This approach guards against prolonged stockouts from delayed shipments while avoiding excessive overstock from older high arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $23.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 in multiple recent observations (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). On-hand=44, in-transit=269; several past orders were delayed but recent pattern is stable at 3. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time. Demand has settled around the mid-80s recently (Periods 13\u201317 demands = [91,72,110,82,67], mean=84.4). Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat yields (1+L)-period forecast that captures the current regime without overreacting to older data. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets safety stock for a 3-period lead while avoiding excessive holding from older high-volume periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=0, in-transit=294. Concluded history shows multiple observed lead times with a preponderance of 3-period arrivals (recent confirms: P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). This indicates actual lead time > promised 2. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures the recent shift toward 3). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the OR engine balance service vs holding cost given the inferred longer lead time. This approach addresses delayed arrivals without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Recent history shows recurrent 3-period arrivals (multiple confirmed 3-period lead times) with occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals; pipeline=381, on-hand=0 so substantial stock is inbound though arrivals may be delayed. Given multiple observed lead times, set L via calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures the recent shift > promised 2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full demand history (Periods 1\u20135 samples) while the calculated L accounts for realized longer lead times and reduces stockout risk without manual volatility tweaks.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=381. Recent conclude history shows frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple confirmed 3s in P4,P7,P8,P12,P16,P17) with occasional 1-2 period outliers; this supports using a recent-average lead time biased to the most recent regime. Demand recently has been moderate (last 5 demands: P16\u2013P20 = 82,67,70,49,46) after several stockouts. I set L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to adapt to the current regime and to ensure orders + pipeline cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost = profit. This accounts for large in-transit volume and the observed 3-period lead-time regime.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand=0, in-transit=381. Recent concluded arrivals show a persistent 3-period lead time (majority of recent observed lead times = 3). Demand has trended down in recent periods (Period_17\u201321 demands = 67,70,49,46,40). To guard against observed longer lead time I set L explicitly to 3. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (captures the lower recent mean and recent variability). These choices align the backend base-stock calculation with confirmed longer lead time and recent lower demand, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service under L=3.

Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=381. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 3-period arrivals (many recent observations of 3) with occasional 1\u20132; several earlier shipments were delayed/lost. To account for the empirically longer lead time I let the backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples using the inferred L; this balances service level (captures longer empirical lead time) against holding cost without overfitting to short recent blips.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: recent concluded history shows actual lead time consistently 3 periods (confirmed earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=381 so there is substantial pipeline but arrivals are delayed relative to promised 2. To reflect confirmed LT=3 I set L explicitly to 3. I forecast demand using the provided historical sample mean (109 units/period) scaled for review+lead (1+L=4) => mu_hat=4*109=436 to cover expected four-period demand. I set sigma_hat explicitly to reflect sqrt(1+L)*std(samples) \u2248 2*13.02 \u2248 26.04 to capture volatility under L=3. These parameters raise target base-stock to serve four periods of demand while acknowledging holding cost parity with profit; using explicit L/forecast prevents the backend from under-ordering due to the promised (but incorrect) lead time.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: recent demand has fallen to ~40s (Periods 20-24: 46,40,51,43,33). On-hand=0, in-transit=436 (covers upcoming demand). Historical conclues show actual lead time = 3 in multiple recent arrivals; treat lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. Set L explicit=3. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower-demand regime (last 5 periods average ~42.6); backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding overstock in a low-demand regime while accounting for confirmed longer lead time so pipeline covers true coverage period.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals recently; use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. Demand has shifted down starting around Period 19 (sustained 7 periods of lower demand); base-stock should use recent regime to avoid overstock. Set L by 'calculate' (avg observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (the most recent low-demand regime, Periods 19\u201325) so OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, reducing holding risk while meeting reduced demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: avg demand for Periods 10\u201318 = 88.6 units, avg demand for Periods 19\u201325 = 42.7 units (-51.8%), sustained for 7 periods.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 19 (mean ~42.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=436 \u2014 large pipeline exists from previous orders. Many past orders exhibited 3-period arrivals; lead time effectively appears 3. To avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding cost, I set lead time explicitly to 3 to size the review+lead window correctly, and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 19\u201325). This keeps orders aligned with the lower demand while the large in-transit inventory provides coverage, reducing unnecessary additional ordering.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical conclude messages show many 3-period arrivals (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, etc.) giving avg observed lead time \u22482.44; several earlier missed arrivals indicate occasional longer lead times. Demand regime dropped at Period 19 and has stayed lower (recent demands P19\u2013P27 average \u224844.2). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture the empiric lead-time (~2.44). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=9, covering P19\u2013P27) so the forecast and volatility reflect the new, lower-demand regime; this avoids overstock given equal profit and holding cost and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 context: recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 19 (avg ~42.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=436 (large pipeline); historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period arrivals. I set lead time explicit=3 to reflect observed LT=3 (promised=2 is unreliable). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 19\u201328) to base mu_hat on the current low-demand regime. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the lower demand regime and account for the longer confirmed lead time, avoiding excess holding given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals (confirmed earlier) and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period_19. To capture actual lead-time behavior I let backend compute observed average lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I target the recent low-demand regime (Periods 19\u201329, length 11) so use recent_N with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to size (1+L)-period forecast and volatility accordingly; this reduces overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31. Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period_19 (avg ~43) and remains depressed through Period_30. On-hand=0, in-transit=436 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times recently cluster at 3 periods (multiple 3s in latest arrivals); use a recent lead-time average to weight recent 3s more. For demand forecasting use recent_N over the current low-demand regime (Periods 19\u201330, length=12) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower mean/variance. These parameters reduce overstock risk given large in-transit and lower demand while capturing the longer recent lead time to avoid stockouts when pipeline arrives.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: recent demand regime is the lower regime confirmed at Period_26 (start Period_19). On-hand=0, in-transit=436 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show repeated 3-period arrivals; I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect actual supplier behavior. For demand I target the post-shift regime: use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 19\u201331) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 13 samples, capturing the sustained lower demand. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=13 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align ordering with the confirmed 3-period lead time and the sustained lower-demand regime, avoiding over-ordering given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand 0, in-transit 436. Historical conclude messages show multiple observed lead times including several 3-period arrivals (evidence of actual lead time > promised 2); use calculated average lead time from observed arrivals. Demand history shows a sustained lower regime since Period 19, but signal is already recorded earlier; to avoid overfitting to short-term noise and because pipeline is large, use default demand and volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (captures observed longer lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals (Periods 4,7,8,12,16,17) and prior carry-over confirmed lead time=3; several early shipments were delayed/lost. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time. Demand regime shifted down around Period 19 (documented previously), so I compute demand over the post-shift window: use recent_N N=15 (Periods 19\u201333) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower, sustained demand and reduced volatility. This keeps orders aligned with current low-demand regime while accounting for the longer lead time and existing large in-transit stock to avoid overstocking.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P9\u2192P12) and delayed/lost shipments early \u2014 so set lead time explicitly to 3. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 19 (avg ~42.7) so I use recent data to forecast. I select mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 16 periods (covers the post-changepoint regime length) so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand under the current low-demand regime while capturing recent volatility. This balances service (avoiding overstock given holding cost) against lost/delayed arrivals by accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and lower recent demand.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concluded lead times show multiple consistent 3-period arrivals (many 3s, some 1\u20132), overall average lead time ~2.44. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period_19 (periods 19\u201335 mean \u224843.2). Pipeline (436) already covers multiple periods of current demand; to avoid overstock while reflecting confirmed longer lead times, I let backend calculate average lead time from observed data and use recent_N (most recent demand regime) for demand mean and volatility (N=17 covers Periods 19\u201335). These choices bias orders toward servicing the lower, sustained demand regime while the calculated lead time accounts for observed multi-period transit delays.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concludes show actual lead time \u22483 (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7 arrivals) and a sustained demand regime drop beginning Period 19 (avg Period19\u201325=42.7). I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed arrivals and avoid underordering given delayed arrivals. Demand forecast uses recent_N over the post-change regime (most recent 18 periods since the changepoint) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower, sustained demand: this reduces target base-stock and caps excess holding while keeping service for current lower demand levels. Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures current volatility rather than older high-demand variability. No new missing-shipment patterns detected beyond confirmed LT=3.

Historical conclude messages show multiple consistent 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16) \u2014 actual lead time is best modeled as 3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead-time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, letting the engine balance service vs holding cost given the longer lead time and sizable pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: demand has been in the lower regime since Period 19 (confirmed earlier). Recent arrival history shows frequent 3-period lead times (multiple concluded lead_time=3) so I treat lead time as the recent average. On-hand=0 with In-transit=436; given evidence of sustained lower demand since Period 19, I base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime samples to avoid overstating needs. Choices: L by recent_N to capture the empirically observed 3-period arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N using the recent low-demand regime (use N sized to cover the stable recent regime) so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period demand and uncertainty consistent with the new lower-demand regime and the observed longer lead times, balancing service vs. holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. On-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period lead times (multiple confirmed 3s), and demand shifted down around Period 19 and has stayed lower. To reflect confirmed lead-time behavior I set L explicit=3. To forecast demand over review+lead I use recent demand from the post-change regime: recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent 20 demand periods since the sustained drop) for mu_hat and for sigma_hat to reflect current mean and volatility. This keeps service high given long lead time while avoiding overstock by using the lower recent-demand regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concluded arrivals show frequently 3-period lead times (many P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P13->P16, P14->P17) with some 1\u20132 period exceptions; average observed lead time ~2.44 \u2192 use calculate to capture empirical lead-time. Demand experienced a sustained downshift starting Period 19 (noted in carry-over); use recent_N with N=20 (max useful recent window per rules) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and recent variability. These settings tell the OR engine to size base stock and caps using recent lower mean/volatility while using an empirically averaged lead time to avoid underordering given past 3-period arrivals. No new sustained pattern beyond previously recorded shifts is evident.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period_19 (sustained drop from ~88.6 to ~42.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=436 (large pipeline of prior orders). Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period arrivals (multiple confirmed 3-period lead times), and some 1\u20132 period cases; to let the backend estimate current effective lead time from observed data I request it 'calculate' the lead time. For demand I use recent_N=20 (use last 20 periods since the sustained regime shift) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the lower, sustained demand and recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk given the large in-transit volume and account for confirmed longer lead-times inferred from concluded arrivals.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent demand remains in the lower regime identified at Period_26 (post-Period_19 mean ~43); latest five demands (Periods 39\u201343 = 44,63,36,59,48) average ~50. Use a recent-N approach for lead time and demand to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and observed lead-time pattern. Lead time: recent concluded arrivals show mostly 3-period delays (multiple recent 3s), so set L via recent_N to average recent observed lead times. Mu_hat: use recent 5-period demand to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent regime. Sigma_hat: use recent 5-period sample volatility to capture current variability. This keeps safety stock responsive to the lower-demand regime while accounting for the demonstrated 3-period lead time and current in-transit volume (436 units) to avoid over-ordering given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, etc.) and a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 19 (avg ~42.7). To reflect confirmed LT=3 I set L explicit=3. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-change lower regime (use last 20 concluded demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I use recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep the base-stock target aligned with the confirmed longer lead time and the sustained lower-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time \u22483 (multiple observed 3-period arrivals) and a sustained lower-demand regime from Period_19 onward (avg ~42.7). To protect service given longer lead time, I set L explicit=3. For demand I use recent data from the current low-demand regime: recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent 20 periods (conservative, caps at 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower mean/volatility. This balances holding cost and service given long lead time and the sustained lower demand.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. Historical concludes show actual lead times frequently 3 periods (confirmed at Period 8) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (mean fell ~52%). On-hand=0, in-transit=436 (large pipeline). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history (captures the recent confirmed 3-period behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to anchor mu_hat to the post-changepoint regime (use last 20 demand samples to reflect lower recent mean across review+lead). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility rather than older high-demand periods. These choices prioritize matching the backend forecast to the sustained lower-demand regime and observed longer lead times, avoiding overstock from legacy high-demand data while acknowledging substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed earlier: multiple orders with lead_time=3). Demand regime shift at Period 19 to lower mean is recorded in carry-over; recent demand is stable at the lower level. To reflect true arrival delay, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast and volatility, use recent data from the post-shift regime: recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent 20 demands since the regime change) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 20 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(last 20 samples). These choices align orders with the observed longer lead time and recent lower-demand regime, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service given in-transit supply.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 49. Recent demand regime: sustained lower-demand regime since Period 19 (avg ~42.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=436 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers multiple periods. Historical concluded lead times show dominant 3-period arrivals (multiple confirmed 3s). I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times average (reflects confirmed 3-period reality). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent stable low-demand regime (cap N at 20 per rules). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices downweight the pre-Period19 high-demand data, align ordering to the confirmed longer lead time, and prevent over-ordering given current pipeline to balance service vs. holding cost.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 50. On-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical conclude messages show most observed lead times = 3 periods (multiple recent 3s), and a sustained demand regime shift downward starting Period 19 (noted in carry-over). I set L using recent_N to capture the recent modus of lead times (average of last 5 observed lead times, which emphasizes recent 3-period observations). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent post-shift regime (N capped at 20 per rules) so the OR engine targets lower demand while accounting for recent variability. This balances service (longer L to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) against holding cost by shrinking forecasts to the now-lower demand regime.
