Recent realized demand: Period1=3, Period2=17 \u2192 recent average = 10 units/period (2-period sample).

Requirement: ensure pipeline + on-hand covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand; it already does by a wide margin. Therefore ordering more risks extra holding cost and overstocks if shipment arrives.

Assessment: large in-transit quantity likely covers the upcoming demand if it arrives; however arrival has been delayed but not conclusively lost.

Rationale: pipeline (456) comfortably exceeds the 4-period demand estimate (~396), so placing additional order would raise holding cost unnecessarily. Risk notes: monitor upcoming conclude messages to confirm those in-transit arrivals (some orders historically have 3-period lead time or get lost); if arrivals fail to conclude as expected, switch to ordering immediately in future periods.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order\u2014in-transit 456 units > required (~99\xd74\u2248396) for 4-period cover given confirmed 3-period lead time, so ordering would increase holding cost without reducing stockout risk.",
