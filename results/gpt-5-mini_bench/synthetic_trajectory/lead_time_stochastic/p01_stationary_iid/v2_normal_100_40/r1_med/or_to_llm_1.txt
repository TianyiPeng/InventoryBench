{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: carry-over insight already confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (orders observed P1\u2192P4, P9\u2192P12, etc.). Implication: planning horizon = L+1 = 4 periods. Inventory check: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 436 units. Demand outlook: recent period demands average roughly 80\u2013110 units; using a conservative 100 units/period \u2192 4-period demand \u2248 400 units. Since in-transit (436) comfortably covers the next 4 periods' demand plus a small safety buffer, no additional ordering is needed. OR recommended 0 units; I follow that recommendation to avoid unnecessary holding cost given ample pipeline. Strategy: order 0 and monitor upcoming conclude messages to detect any lost shipments or changes to lead time/pipeline; adjust only if arrivals are delayed or lost.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR (order 0): confirmed lead time = 3 and in-transit 436 units exceeds ~4-period demand (~400), so we have sufficient coverage and should avoid extra holding cost.",
