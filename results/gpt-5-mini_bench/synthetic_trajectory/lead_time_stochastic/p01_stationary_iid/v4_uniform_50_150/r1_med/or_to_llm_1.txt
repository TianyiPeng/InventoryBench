Recent realized demand has been high (Period1 demand=134, Period2 demand=129); historical sample mean (~93.8) implies a (L+1)=3 period expected demand ~281 units. OR recommends 54 because it counts the large pipeline_inventory (309) toward the base-stock and caps the order. Risk assessment: if the in-transit 309 arrives as promised, ordering little is appropriate; however if shipments are lost or lead time is longer, we will stock out given recent demand levels. Given zero on-hand and two consecutive periods with no visible arrivals, I will partially hedge by increasing OR's recommendation to provide some immediate coverage while avoiding extreme overstock if shipments do arrive. Action calculation: target coverage for (L+1)=3 periods \u2248281.
