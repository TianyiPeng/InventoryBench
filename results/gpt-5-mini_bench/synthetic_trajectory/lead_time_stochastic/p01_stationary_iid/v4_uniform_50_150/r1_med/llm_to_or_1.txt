Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No arrivals/lead-time observations yet. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [130,88,64,58,129] (mean=93.8, std\u224831.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current+lead demand. Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded lead-time evidence. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock target given profit/holding tradeoff and limited information.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2. On-hand=0, in-transit=151 (order placed P1). No concluded arrivals yet beyond Period_1, so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised 2. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimators based on all historical samples (Period_1-5). This yields (1+L)-scaled mean to set base-stock and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std for safety; conservative given outstanding in-transit but no confirmed delays. Defaults balance service vs holding cost without overreacting to an unconfirmed late shipment.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=309 (orders from P1+P2). No concluded arrivals yet beyond periods 1-2, so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised L=2. Historical demand samples: [130,88,64,58,129] \u2192 mean=93.8, std\u224830.82. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand aggregation to let OR backend compute base_stock from full-sample mean/variance; this keeps safety stock aligned with long-run demand while recognizing current pipeline (309) will likely cover upcoming demand if shipments arrive. No strong/chronic delays proven yet, so avoid explicit escalation.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_4. On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Last three concluded demands: 134, 129, 79 (Periods 1-3). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded/arrived despite promised lead time=2 -> strong evidence of extended lead time or lost shipments. To protect service, I set lead time explicitly longer and base demand forecast on the most recent regime (last 3 periods) which captures the recent dip in demand. This raises the pipeline coverage (1+L) on a lower recent mean, while sigma is computed from recent variability to avoid overstock from older higher-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (total in-transit 363) have not arrived by Period_3 conclude, suggesting actual lead time >2 or lost shipments (evidence: arrived=0 for P1-P3 orders).

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 context: recent demand samples = [130,88,64,58,129]; on-hand=100, in-transit=303. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (P1\u2192P4 implies LT=3; P3\u2192P4 implies LT=1). To capture this variability I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed arrivals (method: calculate). Demand forecast uses default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) letting backend scale by the chosen L; sigma_hat uses default scaling sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service vs holding given current pipeline (303 units) and on-hand 100: defaults will produce base_stock that accounts for the averaged lead time and observed demand variance without overfitting to short spikes or recent noise.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=0, in-transit=359. Historical demand samples (Periods1-5) mean=93.8. Concluded arrivals show heterogeneous lead times: an order placed P1 arrived after 3 periods and an order placed P3 arrived after 1 period, so actual lead time is variable; use observed lead times to let backend average them. I select L='calculate' so the OR engine uses the average observed lead time. For demand I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this uses the full history to stabilize forecasts given noisy/variable arrivals and balances service level versus holding cost under uncertain lead time.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5: 130,88,64,58,129) show mean demand moderate but variable. On-hand=0, in-transit=475 (multiple overdue arrivals historically). Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4); average observed lead time used to capture realized delays. Chosen L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to base forecast on all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead time) against holding cost given current high in-transit volume.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=11, in-transit=330. Historical demand samples (Periods1-5) mean=93.8. Concluded arrivals show varied lead times: observed lead_times = 3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P4->P7) -> average \u22482.33, indicating actual lead time is longer than promised 2 and shipments have been delayed. To account for longer/mixed lead times I set L via recent_N on the last 3 observed lead times so the backend uses the empirical average (~2.33). For demand and volatility I use default methods so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean_all and sqrt(1+L)*std_all respectively; this scales the forecast to cover the review+lead period while the larger L raises target base-stock to protect service given delayed arrivals. This balances higher service level (profit $4 vs hold $1) against holding cost while acknowledging delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times: 3 periods (P1->P4), 1 period (P3->P4), 3 periods (P4->P7); average lead time \u22482.33 \u2014 actual lead time is longer than promised (2) with repeated 3-period delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $268.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: on-hand=0, in-transit=411. Recent concluded lead-times show multiple 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) and one 1-period\u2014average lead time > promised 2. Demand in most recent 5 concluded periods (P4\u2013P8) is elevated and fairly consistent (105,139,96,134,125) so I use a recent-window forecast. Set L by calculating average of observed lead times to let the backend learn realized delays. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the latest demand regime (balances higher service needs vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1). This choice also accounts for overdue/in-transit inventory by increasing the forecast horizon consistent with observed lead-time length.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=374. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = [3,1,3,3,1] (avg \u22482.2) with repeated 3-period delays and some 1-period arrivals; pipeline contains recent shipments that may still arrive. To account for the longer-than-promised lead time I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate). Demand shows no clear recent regime shift across available samples, so use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine set mu_hat and sigma_hat robustly. This balances higher required pipeline cover due to extended lead time against holding cost.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: recent concluded history shows variable but systematically longer-than-promised lead times (observed lead times: 3,1,3,3,1 \u2192 average >2). On-hand=0, in-transit=475 (large pipeline with intermittent arrivals), demand history samples mean=~(130+88+64+58+129)/5=93.8. To let the OR engine internal formula reflect observed lead-time drift while using all demand history, I set L to 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times) and use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) so orders are sized to cover review+lead demand given the inferred lead time. This balances higher service level from longer lead estimates against holding cost given high pipeline and intermittent arrivals.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=475. History shows multiple concluded lead times (3,1,3,3,1) implying actual lead time > promised; several orders previously missing then arrived (delays rather than losses). I set L="calculate" so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures the empirically longer lead time). Demand has shifted upward in recent periods (Periods 7-11 average \u2248120 vs earlier samples \u224894); to reflect recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This increases target base-stock to improve service given longer/variable lead time while keeping volatility estimated from the same recent window to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=54, in-transit=280, profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical concluded arrivals show varying lead times (observed W = 3,1,3,3,1,3,2 \u2192 avg \u22482.29), implying actual lead time > promised 2. Pipeline (280) plus on-hand (54) provides cover but lead-time variability and past delays risk stockouts. I select L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times average; mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' to let OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service level against holding costs given uncertain lead time.

Carry-over insight: Actual lead time confirmed longer than promised: observed lead times = {3,1,3,3,1,3,2}, average \u22482.29 (sustained multi-period 3-period delays evident).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=403. Historical concluded lead times show repeated 3-period delays with observed set {3,1,3,3,1,3,2} (avg \u22482.29) \u2014 actual lead time is longer than promised. To reflect sustained longer lead time I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed average. Recent demand (Periods 9\u201313 = 147,92,101,147,106; mean=118.6) captures current regime better than the older five-sample seed, so I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Demand volatility likely varies with recent periods too, so set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) for consistency. These choices increase the base stock to cover the longer effective pipeline and recent realized demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock tradeoff given profit/holding cost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=478; recent history shows repeated 3-period delays (observed lead times: 3,1,3,3,1,3,2; avg\u22482.29) and intermittent stockouts. I therefore let the backend compute an empirical lead time average from concluded arrivals (method=calculate) so L reflects observed delays. Demand/variance show no clear recent regime shift beyond historical samples, so use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility ((sqrt(1+L))\xd7std) to let the OR engine set base-stock while accounting for the longer inferred lead time. This balances service (avoid stockouts given long/variable lead times) against holding cost.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=472. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period delays (multiple P->P+3 arrivals), so actual lead time is longer than promised and I conservatively set L=3. Demand samples (provided: 130,88,64,58,129) have recent mean ~93.8; using recent_N=5 for mu_hat focuses the forecast on these samples (backend will scale by 1+L). I keep sigma_hat as default to reflect full-sample volatility. These choices aim to raise pipeline cover for the longer lead time while avoiding excessive extra safety stock by using recent demand for the base stock forecast.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=28, in-transit=378. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period arrivals and an average observed lead time > promised (sustained across periods), so infer lead time from observed data rather than trusting promised. Demand recently (Periods 12-16) averaged \u2248112 units; I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime and limit responsiveness to older samples. Chosen methods: L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to set (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u2248 (1+L)\xd7112; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service (accounting for longer empirical lead time) vs holding cost (using recent mean avoids overreacting to older spikes).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=6, in-transit=329. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals and an average observed lead time >2 (sustained). I set L using 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times average (captures the repeated 3-period delays). Demand has risen modestly in recent periods (Periods 13-17 mean \u2248107.8 vs historical sample mean \u224893.8), so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on the latest regime. Volatility also appears higher recently; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices increase the base-stock to cover the longer effective lead time and recent higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples and accounting for delayed arrivals.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Recent demand has averaged ~106 units (last 7 periods) with high variability and repeated multi-period delivery delays. On-hand=0, in-transit=433 (large pipeline but many past promised arrivals were delayed), so treat actual lead time as longer than promised. Set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures sustained 3-period delays). For demand, use recent_N (N=7) to base mu_hat on latest regime (periods 12\u201318) which reflects current demand level ~106; use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service under longer effective lead time while using recent data to avoid overweighting early low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed longer than promised: observed lead_times = {3,1,3,3,1,3,2} (avg \u22482.29) \u2014 sustained multi-period 3-period delays evident

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=446. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = {130,88,64,58,129} (mean=93.8). Concluded arrivals show sustained actual lead-times clustering at 3 periods (observed sequence yields average \u22482.29), so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To balance service level vs holding cost given longer observed lead time and substantial in-transit, use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies the calibrated base-stock while respecting pipeline inventory and caps. This keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample demand while letting L reflect observed lead-time reality.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=453, recent demand has been variable with five most recent demands = {95,126,54,142,53} (mean=94). Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained pattern of many 3-period lead times (average \u22482.3). To protect service given observed multi-period 3-period delays while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set lead-time to the recent average of observed lead times (captures the repeated 3s). For demand forecast I use the most recent 5 periods (captures current regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; this balances higher pipeline needed for longer actual lead times against holding cost.

Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period delays (observed lead times include 3,1,3,3,1,3,2,3,3,3,1,3 -> avg \u22482.29) so actual lead time is persistently > promised. Several past orders arrived late but now there is substantial pipeline (458) that will cover upcoming demand once it concludes. I select L by 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the sustained ~2.3 periods). For demand, I use 'default' for mu_hat and 'default' for sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std using all samples \u2014 this balances service level against holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time and the large in-transit volume. This approach avoids over-ordering now while accounting for the longer realized lead time.

Period 26. On-hand=0, in-transit=458. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period delays (observed lead_times = {3,1,3,3,1,3,2} across concluded orders) \u2014 average \u22482.29, indicating actual lead time > promised 2 and sustained multi-period 3-period delays. I select L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the ~2.29 estimate). For demand forecast and volatility I choose the defaults (mu_hat='default', sigma_hat='default') so the (1+L) scaling automatically inflates order targets to cover the longer effective pipeline and balances service level vs. holding cost given profit/holding economics. This approach raises the base-stock to compensate for delayed arrivals while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using the statistical history.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=458. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (multiple orders with lead_time=3) producing an average actual lead time > promised 2. To reflect sustained longer-than-promised lead times, set L by 'calculate' (use observed lead times). Demand samples (130,88,64,58,129) show mean ~93.8; given longer lead time we keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L. This balances higher safety stock due to extended lead times against holding cost while the backend's capped policy limits order size.

To reflect realized lead-time risk I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate).

I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the sustained longer-than-promised lead time). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes demand forecast and volatility from all samples scaled by (1+L); this balances higher safety-stock from longer L against holding cost given low on-hand and large in-transit volume.

I let the backend compute an empiric lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate) so L reflects the measured average. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so demand scaling uses all samples with the chosen L; this balances service (accounting for longer measured lead time) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals and an average observed lead time \u22482.29 (sustained multi-period 3-period delays vs promised L=2) and multiple delayed/missing arrivals earlier. To account for longer realized lead times while letting the OR engine compute demand aggregation consistently, I ask the backend to calculate L from observed lead times (method=calculate). For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so replenishment scales automatically with the inferred lead time and the historical sample set. This balances raising target pipeline to cover extended delivery delays while avoiding manual overstatement of demand variability given mixed recent history.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: demand history shows intermittent high weekly demand (samples: 130,88,64,58,129) and many concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time has repeatedly exceeded the promised 2 periods (multiple 3-period delays). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=459 (large pipeline but many past delays). Several past orders arrived 3 periods after ordering; average observed lead time >2. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures sustained longer-than-promised LT). For demand sizing I choose mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively \u2014 this leverages full sample evidence while the calculated L corrects for longer pipeline exposure. This balances service (higher L\u2192higher mu_hat for pipeline coverage) against holding cost given current high in-transit volume.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent history shows sustained multi-period delays with observed lead times averaging \u22482.29 (multiple 3-period delays); on-hand=0, in-transit=459 which is a large pipeline cushion. I choose L="calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the confirmed longer-than-promised lead time). For demand I choose mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full sample history\u2014this leverages all available demand data while the calculated L adjusts the review+lead horizon for the observed longer lead time. Given the large in-transit volume, this conservative approach avoids over-ordering while respecting the higher effective lead time; it balances service level (through higher L and base stock) against holding cost (backend caps orders). No new evidence of a fresh, sustained regime or different lead-time than already identified.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Recent history shows repeated 3-period arrivals and an observed average lead time > promised (sustained multi-period 3-period delays through Period 19). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=461 (pipeline present but past behavior shows arrivals often delayed by \u22483). I set L using calculate so backend will use the empirically observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures the sustained longer-than-promised lead time). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes demand over the review+lead period using all samples, which is appropriate given no clear sustained change in demand mean/variance in the last several periods. This balances service level (by acknowledging longer lead times) against holding cost (avoiding explicit inflation of forecasts without strong demand regime evidence).

LLM Rationale:
Period 35: recent demand mostly ~75\u2013147 with long history of intermittent stockouts; on-hand=0, in-transit=461 (many delayed arrivals historically). Multiple concluded periods show actual lead times frequently 3 periods (average \u22482.3) and several lost/delayed shipments. To be conservative against understocking I set lead time explicit=3 to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this increases target pipeline and safety stock to offset delayed arrivals while balancing holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

To protect service given frequent 3-period delays, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand sizing so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures baseline demand) and default volatility so backend scales std by sqrt(1+L). This raises pipeline coverage (covers 4 periods) to reduce stockouts while letting OR cap control order size against holding cost.

To protect against continued 3-period deliveries I set L explicit=3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base_stock on the most recent demand regime (covers (1+L) periods) \u2014 this raises safety stock given longer lead time while limiting excess holding cost relative to older, irrelevant samples.

I set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate).

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) show volatile daily-like demand with historical samples [130,88,64,58,129]. On-hand=0, in-transit=461 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but many past orders experienced 3-period delays, so promised L=2 has frequently been exceeded. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures sustained >2 shifts). For demand sizing I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this ties safety stock to the inferred lead time while keeping demand estimate robust to noise. This balances service (raise target if lead time is longer) versus holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical concluded lead times show repeated 3-period delays (sustained evidence across many periods); treat actual L as 3. Recent demand (Periods 36-40 = 133,27 sold then 99,129,145,139 \u2014 recent five-period mean \u2248129) is higher than earlier samples, so use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) scaled by (1+L) to capture current regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. With L=3, (L+1)=4 so pipeline/in-transit should cover 4 periods; current in-transit (461) \u2248115 per period which is below recent mean (~129), so parameters will prompt replenishment to raise service while balancing holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=547. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period delays and prior carry-over average lead time \u22482.29. To account for sustained longer-than-promised lead times I let the backend compute average observed lead time (method=calculate). Demand samples are limited; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, which balances service level uplift from longer L against holding cost given high in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. On-hand=0, in-transit=547 \u2014 large pipeline but many past delays (multiple observed 3-period arrivals) indicating actual lead time > promised. I choose L=calculate so backend uses observed lead-time history (captures longer-than-promised avg ~2.3). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so forecasts use all demand samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L); this is conservative given lead-time uncertainty and large in-transit volume, letting OR backend size orders to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for longer effective lead time.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=547. Demand history shows persistent multi-period delays (multiple concluded lead_times mostly 3, average >2), and large outstanding pipeline. To reflect observed actual lead time I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses average of observed lead times. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' (use all samples) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the provided demand samples; this balances higher safety stock from longer inferred lead time against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: recent demand has been consistently ~100\u2013145 per period; current on-hand=30, in-transit=461 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (repeated P1->P4, P4->P7, P41->P44 patterns) indicating actual lead time > promised 2. To ensure pipeline covers the longer travel time and avoid stockouts, I set L explicit=3. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime and scale by (1+L) in the backend; sigma_hat uses default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the backend account for increased variability over the longer lead+review period. This combination raises the base-stock to protect service level given delayed shipments while the default sigma keeps safety stock calibrated to observed variability.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. History shows repeated 3-period arrivals and an average actual lead time > promised (sustained). Use L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples; this balances service level against holding cost given longer realized lead times and large pipeline. This approach acknowledges delayed shipments while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy demand swings.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times consistently often 3 periods (carry-over average \u22482.29 > promised 2) and multiple delayed/missing arrivals earlier. To account for the longer realized lead time I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time from concluded history. Demand sample set is limited; use default forecasting (mu_hat='default', sigma_hat='default') so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to full-sample demand while letting the lead-time estimate reflect sustained longer deliveries and thus increases pipeline coverage to reduce stockouts given large in-transit volume and past 3-period delays.
