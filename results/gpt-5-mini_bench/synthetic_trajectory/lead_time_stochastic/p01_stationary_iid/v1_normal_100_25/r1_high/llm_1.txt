No evidence yet of lost orders or lead-time deviations (need concluded arrivals to confirm). Inventory balance & decision: on-hand is 0 but in-transit 270 likely covers ~2+ periods of expected demand (~110\u2013120), avoiding stockouts while minimizing holding costs. Given high profit per unit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), ordering more could be profitable if demand rises, but with a large in-transit shipment already and uncertainty about lead-time reliability, I avoid adding risk of lost/overstock.
