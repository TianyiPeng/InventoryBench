OR recommends 34 units (based on promised lead time and historical samples) which would push pipeline above the 3-period expected demand. I choose not to add more inventory this period (order 0) to avoid exacerbating potential overstock if delayed shipments suddenly arrive or if in-transit is correct. Plan: wait one more period to see if any conclude message reports arrivals; if no arrivals appear next conclude, escalate (place a replacement order) because current on-hand is zero and actual pipeline may be lost.
