Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Historical samples: [82,89,65,106,136], overall mean=95.6. Promised lead time is 2 and no evidence to change it. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_all and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_all. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5) and limited information.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=140 (order from P1) and no concluded arrivals observed yet, so actual lead time cannot be inferred\u2014cannot assume lost shipment. Use default promised lead time to let OR backend apply its historical-demand-based forecast. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default (use all samples) so base-stock reflects long-run mean and variance; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1) implying q=0.5.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (orders placed P1=140, P2=135). Promised lead time=2; both prior orders have not yet concluded but could arrive this period (arrivals visible in Period_3 conclude at Period_4). No confirmed lead-time change or lost shipment yet. Historical demand samples available (Period_1-5: 82,89,65,106,136). I choose default lead time to trust the promise, and default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given no confirmed regime change.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=297 (orders from P1-P3). Period_1 concluded: P1 order (140) did not arrive by its expected conclude \u2014 possible delay/lost but not yet a sustained pattern (only one missed conclude). Use promised lead time (default) because we lack 3+ periods confirming a lead-time shift. Demand history samples: [82,89,65,106,136]. Select default demand aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost without overreacting to a single missed arrival.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period_5. On-hand=54, in-transit=147. History shows arrivals with mixed lead times (order from P1 arrived in P4 => lead_time=3; order from P3 arrived in P4 => lead_time=1). I set L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures this mix). Demand samples show a recent uptick (Period_5=136 vs earlier mean ~96), but evidence is not yet a sustained regime shift, so I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' to use all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) allowing the OR engine to balance service level vs holding cost given inferred lead time. This also keeps policy conservative given sizable in-transit stock and potential lost/delayed shipments in history.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_6. On-hand=0, in-transit=292. Historical demand samples: [82,89,65,106,136] showing a recent upward shift (Periods 3-5: 65,106,136). Lead-time evidence from concluded messages: Period4 shows arrivals for orders placed P1 (lead_time=3) and P3 (lead_time=1); Period5 order (placed P5) has not concluded. Choice: set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (accounts for variability between 1 and 3). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent higher-demand regime (Periods 3-5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (capture upward demand trend) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and uncertain arrivals.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 start. Recent demands: [82,89,65,106,136] show an upward drift in last two periods. Pipeline 436 = outstanding orders from Periods 2,4,5,6 (no concludes) \u2014 some shipments are delayed/lost vs promised. Observed lead times from concluded arrivals: order P1\u2192P4 had lead_time=3 (one sample); P3\u2192P4 lead_time=1. Because of at least one confirmed late arrival and multiple outstanding in-transit orders, I set L explicitly to 3 to be conservative. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (last 3 demands 65,106,136) to capture the recent uplift; mu_hat thus targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean. I keep sigma_hat as default (uses all samples) to avoid overfitting volatility from few recent points. These settings raise target base-stock to protect service given delayed arrivals while keeping variance estimate stable to limit excess holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=438. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) mean = 95.4, std \u2248 26.6. Observed concluded lead times: P1\u2192P4 = 3, P3\u2192P4 = 1, P4\u2192P7 = 3 \u2192 average observed lead time \u2248 2.33. Several past orders did not arrive within promised LT (see carry-over). To balance service vs holding cost I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times so the OR engine plans for somewhat longer delivery. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively, letting the engine compute base-stock while accounting for the inferred longer lead time.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed P2=135, P5=145, P6=144 units have not arrived within promised lead time (no conclude for these orders as of Period_8).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 start: on-hand=25, in-transit=279. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {P1->P4:3, P3->P4:1, P4->P7:3, P5->P8:3, P7->P8:1} indicating a mixture but average lead time > promised. Several 3-period arrivals recently (P1,P4,P5) so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer the current empirical L. Demand samples: [82,89,65,106,136]; recent demand (last 3) mean=102.33, higher than early periods, so use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the upward regime. Match sigma_hat to same recent window (recent_N N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base stock to protect service given confirmed multi-period delays while keeping holding exposure controlled by using recent stats rather than full-sample smoothing.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period_3: avg of Period_3-5 = 102.33 vs Period_1-2 = 85.50 (+19.6%); multiple arrivals observed with 3-period lead time (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent demand volatile but elevated vs start of horizon (last 5 demands P5-P9 mean=110.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (covers multiple periods). Several past orders experienced 3-period lead times repeatedly (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) and some single-period anomalies; some orders remain missing beyond promised LT. I set L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures observed 3-period mode while accounting for occasional 1s). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest regime (Periods 5-9) where mean/variance better reflect current demand. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service by sizing base stock to recent demand under the empirically longer lead time while keeping variability estimates current to limit excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period_3 with multiple observed 3-period lead times (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=441 (pipeline large but arrivals lag due to 3-period lead). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest demand regime while smoothing older low samples; with L=3 the OR backend will compute mu_hat across the 4-period review+lead using the last 5 demand samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so variability reflects the recent window. These choices prioritize service (using confirmed longer lead time) while limiting excess safety stock by using a short recent window rather than all historical samples.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=441. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) plus some 1-period arrivals; average observed lead time > promised. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the empirical average of observed lead times. Demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning Period 3; to capture recent demand levels I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 demand observations (balances responsiveness to the regime shift while smoothing noise). This increases the (1+L)*mean forecast and the volatility estimate so the OR backend raises base-stock to protect service given delayed arrivals and elevated demand, while the capped order limit still restrains excessive single-period orders to control holding cost.

Demand recent volatility and mean have shifted vs initial samples; use last 5 periods to capture current regime. Set L explicit=3 to match observed arrivals so OR orders cover correct pipeline. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make (1+L)-period forecast responsive to the recent lower/higher swings (balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding).

Historical concludes show consistent 3-period actual lead time (orders P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12) and several missing/delayed arrivals earlier; demand recent history (Periods1-13) mean \u2248102.15. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR backend accounts for the longer pipeline. For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples) to capture the full-sample demand level and variance; this balances service (higher target inventory given longer L) vs holding cost given profit=holding. This also avoids overreacting to short fluctuations while acknowledging sustained lead-time shift and substantial pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Several earlier orders were delayed/lost but current pipeline is large. I choose L="calculate" so backend uses observed lead-time average; mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so demand forecast uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher effective lead time (reducing stockouts given in-transit/late arrivals) while keeping demand estimate anchored to full history to avoid overreacting to short spikes.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 3 (Periods 3-5 noticeably higher) and multiple observed arrivals with 3-period lead time. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=404 (covers future demand but some earlier orders were delayed). I set L="calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mix of 1,2,3 observations but reflects prevailing 3-period pattern). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to focus the forecast on the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 3-5) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of last 3 samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in that recent regime. These choices prioritize service during the higher-demand regime while avoiding overstock from older low-demand data.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=404. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12) with some 1\u20132 period cases; average observed lead time \u22482.29. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show recent higher mean starting P3; current pipeline (404) is large vs recent demands, so use calculated average lead time so backend accounts for realized delays while letting it compute base-stock from full sample mean/variance. Methods chosen: L by calculate to capture observed lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat default so backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, balancing service vs holding given large in-transit.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:

Given sustained evidence of L=3 and promised=2, set L explicitly to 3 so OR backend plans for longer pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history) to keep demand smoothing across available data while the confirmed lead-time change handles overdue shipments and maintains service vs holding balance.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=30, in-transit=307. Historical concludes show a consistent actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P14->P17). Several earlier shipments were delayed/lost but recent pattern supports L=3. Demand showed a sustained upward regime starting around Period_3 (P3-5 avg=102.33 vs P1-2=85.5); to capture recent variability I use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and volatility so the OR base-stock reflects the most recent demand pace while limiting overreaction. Explicit L=3 forces the OR engine to plan for the longer realized lead time, reducing stockouts from late arrivals; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service level versus holding cost by anchoring to the latest demand regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical concludes show consistent 3-period actual lead time (multiple P->P+3 arrivals) and several lost/delayed earlier shipments. Recent demand (Periods 15-19 = 84,28,43,40,57) is lower than the earlier regime; to adapt quickly I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead demand forecast and variability on the most recent regime. This balances service (using true longer lead time) against holding cost by shrinking forecast to recent lower demand.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_21: recent demand history shows elevated, then variable demand (20 samples, mean\u224886.7). Multiple arrivals confirm actual lead time > promised (several 3-period arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=307 \u2014 pipeline sizable but includes delayed arrivals; no new sustained demand regime beyond earlier Period_3+ shift. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures persistent 3-period pattern). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (accounts for longer inferred lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_22. On-hand=0, in-transit=354. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 3-period actual lead time (multiple P->P+3 observations) and several lost/delayed earlier shipments; therefore I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect realized transit. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) with L=3 \u2014 this leverages full historical demand while the explicit L captures the persistent longer lead time, helping the OR engine size orders to cover the longer pipeline and avoid stockouts despite in-transit uncertainty.

To capture the confirmed longer lead time I set L explicit=3 so mu/sigma cover review+lead demand correctly. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime of higher demand and recent volatility; this keeps base-stock responsive while preventing over-ordering given large in-transit volume.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=11, in-transit=307. History shows multiple orders arriving with 3-period lead time (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P14->P17, P21->P23) \u2014 actual lead time confirmed as 3. Demand recently moderate: last 5 demands (Periods 19-23) = [57,43,33,49,36], mean\u224843.6. To cover review+lead horizon and reflect recent regime, set L explicit=3 and forecast using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7recent mean; keep sigma_hat default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (accounting for confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost given moderate recent demand.

Demand samples (Period_1-5) and extended history show moderate variability but no new sustained demand regime since prior insight. To hedge delayed arrivals while letting OR backend use observed lead-time average, set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period_26 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=327. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 3-period arrivals plus some 2- and 1-periods; average observed lead time ~2.33. Demand shows sustained higher regime beginning Period_3 (higher mean across many subsequent periods). To capture the actual lead-time behavior I request the backend compute the observed-average lead time ('calculate'). For demand I use a recent window to reflect the sustained post-Period_3 regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the last 20 periods to balance higher mean demand and recent volatility). These choices aim to raise the base-stock to meet service under longer effective lead times while the recent-N demand estimate avoids overreacting to short spikes and controls holding cost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27 start. Recent history shows realized lead times frequently =3 (several P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P14->P17) but some 1-2 observations exist; pipeline=327, on-hand=0 so substantial stock in-transit. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures the upward shift vs promised 2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this balances higher effective demand during the review+lead period while keeping volatility estimate broad given mixed recent regimes. This approach accounts for delayed arrivals by increasing review+lead coverage via averaged L while avoiding overfitting short recent swings.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 periods repeatedly (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). Recent demand (Periods 23-27 = 36,54,56,77,75) is lower than early spikes; I therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the most recent regime (captures current average demand and variability over the last 5 periods). This balances service (accounting for 3-period arrivals) against holding cost by anchoring target stock to recent demand rather than older high spikes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical conclues show frequent 3-period actual lead times (multiple P->P+3 arrivals) and several lost/delayed early orders; use explicit L=3 to reflect observed reality. Recent demand (Periods_24-28 = 54,56,77,75,47) appears lower than earlier spike\u2014use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock responsive to current lower demand while accounting for the longer observed lead time and the substantial pipeline (327) to avoid overstocking given holding cost=profit.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=30. On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times \u22483 periods repeatedly (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) so use calculated average lead time from observations. Recent realized demand (last 5 concluded demands: Period_25-29 = 56,77,75,47,75) suggests a moderate demand level; to reflect current regime I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices balance service (accounting for observed longer lead time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=327. History shows multiple concluded arrivals with frequent 3-period actual lead times (several P->P+3 observations) and some variability; several earlier orders were delayed/lost before conclusions. To capture the observed lead-time behavior I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded messages. For demand I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect all available samples scaled by the inferred L. This balances service (by increasing L if arrivals are slower) against holding cost without overfitting to short recent spikes. No new sustained regime change beyond previously recorded insights.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show 3-period actual lead times (multiple P->P+3 confirms). Recent demand (Periods_28-31: 47,75,92,55; include P27=75) average ~68 \u2014 demand moderate and variable. Set L by calculate to let backend use observed lead times average. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime, reducing exposure to older higher early-period values and matching current variability. This balances service (capture recent demand) vs holding cost (avoid overstock given holding cost equals profit).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: recent history shows sustained higher demand vs early samples and multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (orders P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P14->P17). Current inventory: on-hand 0, in-transit 327 units (covers \u22483.4 periods at historical mean). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time. mu_hat set explicit to (1+L)\xd7mean(samples) = 4\xd795.6 = 382.4 to size the base-stock over review+lead period. sigma_hat set explicit to sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(samples) = 2\xd724.103 \u2248 48.206 to represent observed variability. These choices align the OR backend with confirmed 3-period arrivals and provide coverage for ~4 periods of demand while limiting excess holding cost given holding=profit.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical conclude messages show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P14->P17, P21->P23) so I let backend compute average observed lead time. Demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning around Period_3 (earlier carry-over noted), so I bias mu_hat to recent demand behavior using the last 5 samples. sigma_hat left as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices aim to ensure pipeline covers the longer observed lead time while keeping safety stock responsive to recent higher demand.

Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (several P->P+3 arrivals) with occasional 2- and 1-periods; pipeline is large so avoid inflating forecasts. Use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to capture actual behavior; use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)*mean, sqrt(1+L)*std) so OR backend applies consistent base-stock scaling given the chosen L.

LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical conclues show actual lead time=3 periods (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8), so use explicit L=3 to capture observed delays and avoid under-ordering. Demand recent behavior stable with higher regime since Period_3; I base forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 31-35) to reflect current mean/volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) gives the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled forecast and recent volatility for safety while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess inventory. This balances service (covering ~4 periods of current demand) against holding cost given profit=holding so modest safety via recent volatility is appropriate.

Period 37.

On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (large pipeline). I select L = calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the repeated 3-period pattern). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014conservative given limited recent on-hand and large in-transit volume.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. Recent history shows repeated 3-period arrivals (many orders arriving 3 periods after ordering) and current on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Several earlier shipments were delayed beyond the promised 2-period lead time, and pipeline is large but arrivals will occur with 3-period lag. To protect service while avoiding excess holding, I set lead time explicitly to 3 (matches observed arrivals). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples with L=3, balancing increased replenishment needs from longer lead time against holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P14->P17, P21->P23).

LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical concludes strongly indicate actual lead time = 3 (multiple P->P+3 arrivals, Period_38 confirmed). Given confirmed 3-period lead time, I set L explicitly to 3 so the OR backend forecasts over the correct replenishment horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all provided demand samples (leveraging full sample history). This balances service level (accounting for longer lead time) against holding cost while respecting existing demand data and the sizeable in-transit pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (consistent across multiple observations). To protect service given in-transit but zero on-hand and confirmed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine forecasts over the correct lead horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (robust given mixed demand history). This balances service (captures longer LT) while avoiding overfitting to recent volatility; existing large in-transit position will moderate orders.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P14->P17, P21->P23), so I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect realized arrival timing and avoid under-ordering. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this leverages full historical demand while accounting for the longer lead time. This balances service level (capturing 3-period coverage) versus holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical concludes consistently show a 3-period lead time (multiple P->P+3 arrivals); several earlier shipments were delayed/lost but recent pattern confirms L=3. Use explicit L=3 to align OR with observed arrivals. Demand samples show no new sustained regime change since prior insights, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the backend compute replenishment targets while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. On-hand=0, in-transit=383; history shows consistent 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P14->P17, P21->P23) and multiple missing/delayed shipments earlier, so I set lead time to 3 to reflect actual behavior. With profit=holding ($1/$1) service target 50% (z\u22480), using default demand aggregation lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples; this balances fill rate vs holding given equal cost/profit. Defaults also let the backend apply its cap.

Period_44: observed sustained actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed repeatedly in conclude messages). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=383 \u2014 substantial pipeline present. Use explicit L=3 to match observed reality so backend forecasts over the correct lead horizon. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (leveraging full history); this balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and sizable pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P14->P17, P21->P23, etc.). Several earlier periods show a modest upward demand regime but the long-run samples are still informative. I set L=3 (explicit) to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time so the OR engine sizes pipeline for (1+L) periods. I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5) and avoids overfitting to short-term spikes. No other overdue-shipment evidence requires escalation beyond using L=3.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. On-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals), and many earlier shipments were delayed/lost; therefore set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality. Recent demand (Periods 41-45 = 69,42,76,137,94) averages \u224883.6; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current regime including the recent spike. Volatility also taken from the same recent 5 periods (recent_N N=5) so sigma_hat reflects current short-term variability. These choices align pipeline coverage to (1+L) periods of recent demand while limiting excess holding given high holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: demand recent five periods (P42-46) shows variability with mean ~77.6 and recent spike P44=137. On-hand=0, in-transit=383 (covers pipeline). Historical concludes show a consistent 3-period lead time. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I choose mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime so the OR backend adapts to the current demand level while avoiding overweighting older data; this balances service level versus holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical conclues show a sustained 3-period lead time (multiple P->P+3 arrivals). To align OR backend with observed reality I set L explicitly to 3. Demand recently has been stable ~70\u201390 with occasional spikes; to capture the current regime I use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the last 20 periods of demand and avoid overreacting to single spikes. This increases service coverage for the 1+L review+lead window while keeping safety stock driven by recent variability; with profit=holding, target service quantile is moderate, so using recent data balances fill rate vs holding cost. Also note large pipeline (383) will be included by the backend when computing final order.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Several earlier promised arrivals were delayed; pipeline is large now (383) so avoid inflating demand forecast. I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over samples) so the OR engine balances service vs. holding cost using the confirmed 3-period lead time and historical demand stats.

To respect observed delivery behavior and avoid over-ordering while covering (1+L) demand, set L explicit=3 so the OR backend forecasts across the correct lead horizon; use default demand estimators (all-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L)) since no new, sustained demand regime change after prior insights. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5) and large current pipeline.
