I increase above OR to cover the extra period implied by L=3 and to buffer variability. I order 80 units (slightly above the 49-unit shortfall) to provide ~1 extra period of safety given lead-time uncertainty and the equal profit/holding costs tradeoff.\nFinal strategy: place order of 80 units to raise pipeline to ~327 units (covers ~4.4 periods at recent demand ~74), balancing stockout risk from longer-than-promised lead times against holding cost.",
