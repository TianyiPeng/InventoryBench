Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals observed; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples show mean ~95.6/unit per period with moderate volatility. Promised lead time = 2 and no evidence to alter it. Use default lead-time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (covering 3 periods demand) against holding cost given current lack of arrivals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=140 (ordered P1, not yet concluded). Promised lead time=2 and there is only one conclude showing arrived=0 \u2014 insufficient evidence of a sustained lead-time change or demand regime shift. Use defaults so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service level using historical demand while avoiding overreacting to a single delayed arrival. In-transit 140 partially covers upcoming demand but may not be sufficient vs. default target; letting backend compute base_stock from historical stats is appropriate now.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=279 (orders from P1+P2); no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time not confirmed. Historical demand mean ~95.6 (samples Period_1-5). Promised lead time used (default) because conclude messages do not show any arrivals to infer a lead-time change; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline forecast that covers review+lead demand while avoiding premature adjustments given absent arrival confirmations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=355 (sum of orders P1=140,P2=139,P3=76) but no arrivals observed in concludes P1-P3 \u2014 shipments outstanding beyond promised L=2. Recent realized demands (P1-P3) are elevated: 108,144,142. I treat lead time as longer than promised and set L explicit=3 to hedge against delayed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (focus on the most recent high-demand regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last3). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices increase target pipeline to reduce stockouts given overdue shipments while keeping variability grounded in recent data.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed P1(140), P2(139), P3(76) remain in-transit (355) with no arrivals in concludes P1-P3 \u2014 suggests realized lead time >2 or lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: on-hand=132, in-transit=304, recent demand samples = [82,89,65,106,136] (mean=95.6). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (P1 order arrived in P4 -> lead_time=3; P3 arrived in P4 -> lead_time=1) and P2 remains outstanding, indicating lead-time variability and possible delays. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times to estimate average actual lead time. I choose mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain lead time and existing large in-transit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $143.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6: recent concluded history shows mixed lead times (observed arrivals indicate lead_time samples 3 and 1). On-hand = 77, in-transit = 342 (several earlier orders long in-transit). I choose L.method = calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed variability). Demand history mean = 95.6 units/period; using mu_hat.method = default yields (1+L)*mean demand so the base-stock covers review+lead demand. sigma_hat.method = default lets backend scale observed demand volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service vs holding given high pipeline and uncertain arrivals: using calculated L reflects realized lead-time evidence while default demand/volatility use full-sample stats to avoid overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=381. History shows observed lead times in concludes: order from P1 arrived in P4 (lead_time=3) and order from P3 arrived in P4 (lead_time=1) \u2014 variability around the promised L=2. Demand samples (Periods 1-5): [82,89,65,106,136]. I set L via calculate (average of observed lead times) to let the backend reconcile variable realized lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the base-stock policy adapts to the inferred lead time while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $405.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start: on-hand=51, in-transit=288. Historical concludes show actual lead times observed = 3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P4->P7). There are delayed arrivals earlier but recent pattern shows multiple 3-period lead times. Demand recent trajectory (periods 5-7 concluded demands = 55, 94, 114) is higher than earlier samples, so I use a recent-N forecast to capture the current higher regime. Choose L by calculating average observed lead time to reflect realized delays; choose mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to target the (1+L)-period demand with recent demand mean/volatility. This raises target base-stock to protect service given longer effective lead time while keeping variance estimated from recent demand to avoid overstock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order on P1 arrived P4; order on P4 arrived P7)

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent conclude messages show consistent 3-period arrivals (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). On-hand=111, in-transit=241; several past orders that were delayed now consistently arrive after 3 periods. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I choose mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all demand samples, letting the model incorporate full historical variability with the corrected lead time. This balances service level (longer lead time needs higher base stock) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8).

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality so the OR backend sizes the review+lead demand window as 1+L=4 periods. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples so orders balance service level vs holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11. Recent conclude history shows multiple 3-period lead-time observations (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) and delayed/no arrivals thereafter; on-hand=0, in-transit=385 (pipeline present but deliveries lag). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Demand has shifted recently; I use recent_N (N=5, Periods 6\u201310) to capture the current regime: mean(94,114,50,113,71)=88.4 \u2192 (1+L)*mean used by backend; same recent window for volatility to reflect current demand variability. These settings increase target pipeline to cover 4 periods of demand given longer lead time, improving service while accepting holding cost tradeoff.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 context: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) mean=95.6, std\u224824.10. On-hand=0, in-transit=401 (multiple past delayed shipments). Historical concluded arrivals show sustained actual lead time \u22483 (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8 observations). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time (protects against repeated delays/losses). Using mu_hat default and sigma_hat default applies (1+L) scaling to overall sample mean and std to produce a demand-across-review+lead forecast and volatility consistent with available data; this yields a higher base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline while sigma scaling controls safety stock. These choices balance service (avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) versus holding cost by relying on observed demand stats rather than overreacting to single-period noise.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: multiple concluded arrivals confirm realized lead time = 3 (see P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12). Current inventory: on-hand=97, in-transit=233 \u2192 pipeline_total=330. Historical sample mean (periods provided) =95.6. With L=3, (1+L)=4 so target cover \u2248382.4; pipeline+on-hand (330) < target \u2192 need replenishment. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and used default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (using confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost while allowing backend cap to limit order size given uncertainty and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: orders P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=344. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12). To avoid stockouts caused by multi-period delays, I set L explicitly to 3. Demand has risen in recent periods (e.g., demands up to 149) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated mean and volatility across the review+lead horizon. These choices align ordering with observed 3-period arrivals and raise the forecast and safety buffer to balance service level vs. holding cost given delayed shipments.

Several earlier orders were delayed/lost under promised L=2, so I explicitly set L=3 to match observed reality.

Given confirmed LT=3, set L explicit=3 so OR backend sizes pipeline for the true delay. Demand history is limited; use backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to avoid overfitting to recent volatile periods. This preserves service (higher base-stock for longer LT) while letting the cap limit excess ordering to control holding cost.

Many earlier delayed shipments observed; treat lead time as 3 to ensure pipeline covers true transit. I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service (higher base stock due to longer lead time) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect realized lead time so the OR backend orders against the correct pipeline horizon. Using mu_hat default lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) which captures the baseline demand across the 4-period review+lead horizon. sigma_hat default lets backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) for demand variability. These choices align order targets with observed longer lead times and balance service level (profit-driven) vs holding cost by feeding correct L into the base-stock calculation.

To ensure the OR engine plans for the longer delivery lag, I set L explicitly to 3. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the engine uses all demand samples scaled for (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and current healthy pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_20: recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 shown) have mean ~? but full history exhibits volatile but not structurally different regimes. On-hand=144, in-transit=250 (no new conclude yet). Multiple concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, etc.), so set L explicitly to 3 to reflect realized supplier behavior and avoid under-ordering. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages full historical demand while the explicit L protects against observed delayed arrivals. This balances service (higher pipeline for L=3) versus holding cost by letting backend set safety stock via standard profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21. Recent demand samples (P1-P5: 82,89,65,106,136) show moderate variability; current on-hand=83, in-transit=271 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods across many orders (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations). I set L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures realized LT\u22483). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, ensuring the base-stock and caps scale with the inferred longer lead time and balance service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1. This addresses overdue/delayed shipments by increasing coverage for the longer effective lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

Current inventory: on-hand=69, in-transit=301. With confirmed LT=3, use L explicit=3 so the OR backend stocks for the correct pipeline length. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full sample history while accounting for the longer review+lead period. These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the extra period of demand caused by LT=3, improving service while the holding cost ($1) is moderate relative to profit ($4). No evidence of lost shipments beyond confirmed LT=3.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical demand samples; this yields a larger review+lead demand forecast and safety stock appropriate for the longer confirmed lead time, reducing stockouts while the holding cost ($1) tempers excessive inventory.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples\u2014this keeps the demand forecast anchored to full-sample history while the explicit L corrects for delayed arrivals, balancing service level (by matching true lead time) against holding cost.

Pipeline (336) is large relative to current on-hand so do not inflate demand forecast further; let OR backend compute base_stock using full-sample mean scaled by (1+L). Chosen methods (calculate/default/default) instruct backend to use observed lead-time average and default demand/volatility scaling so orders will cover (L+1) periods of demand while keeping holding cost in the optimization.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=51, in-transit=282. Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple observed P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). To ensure pipeline coverage and align OR backend forecasting with realized delays, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving robustness given no clear recent demand regime shift. This balances service level (accounting for longer LT) against holding cost given current moderate on-hand and substantial in-transit.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27. On-hand=0, in-transit=329.

Several early orders were delayed/late, so promised L=2 is unreliable. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality. I use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which yields a base-stock covering the review+lead window (L+1 periods) and balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: confirmed sustained actual lead time = 3 periods from multiple concluded arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). On-hand=0, in-transit=384 \u2192 significant pipeline exists but arrivals will occur with 3-period lag. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed realized lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples with L=3; this balances service level given profit/holding tradeoff while letting backend apply its capped order cap. This choice addresses delayed arrivals and avoids under-ordering due to underestimated lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=337. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. To ensure orders cover the review+lead horizon I set L explicit=3. Demand has been around ~40\u2013110 recently; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest regime (last 5 periods) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent window. This balances service (higher L requires larger pipeline) against holding cost by tying targets to recent demand rather than long-ago samples.

To ensure pipeline covers (1+L) periods and account for delayed arrivals, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand history, keeping estimates conservative given variable demand and confirmed longer lead time; this balances service level against holding cost while relying on backend's statistical calc.

No new sustained demand regime detected. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect realized lead time so the OR engine plans for the correct pipeline coverage (orders must cover current + 3 future periods). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this maintains stable aggregate forecasts and lets the OR cap/order logic balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to short-term noise.

Recent demand (last 5 observed periods) appears representative of the current regime, so I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent demand level while accounting for the 1+L review+lead horizon. This balances service (recognizing LT=3) against holding cost by avoiding over-commitment to older high-demand spikes.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. On-hand=0, in-transit=376. History shows repeated confirmed 3-period actual lead times (multiple conclude messages P\u2192P+3). I set L explicit=3 to reflect realized lead time and avoid under-ordering. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (keeps forecast anchored to full historical demand while the backend balances service vs holding cost). This choice ensures orders cover the review+lead horizon given confirmed longer lead time and the visible pipeline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_41: recent history shows repeated confirmations that actual lead time = 3 (multiple concluded orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=376 so pipeline is substantial but arrivals are delayed by the 3-period lead time. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed realized lead time so the OR engine sizes orders for the correct pipeline horizon. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. Recent demand (Periods 37-41 = 56,71,94,79,93) averages ~78.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=376 \u2014 substantial pipeline but actual arrivals are delayed historically (lead time repeatedly observed = 3). I set L explicit=3 to match confirmed 3-period lead time. I set mu_hat recent_N N=5 to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent demand regime (captures current ~78.6 mean); sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock calculation with the observed 3-period lead time and recent demand, helping the backend size orders to cover four periods of demand while avoiding excess safety stock given the large in-transit volume.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=376. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17), so I set L explicit=3. With L=3 the review+lead horizon is 4 periods; I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (many recent nonzero demand observations but intermittent stockouts), so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 20 samples. This balances service (longer confirmed lead time) against holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff. Pipeline (376) currently covers several lead periods but visibility is delayed; using recent demand stats prevents over-ordering from stale early-sample spikes.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect realized lead time so the OR backend sizes orders over the correct horizon. Demand estimates use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the backend compute base_stock and cap given the adjusted lead time and preserve standard service/holding tradeoff.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=376. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Many earlier orders experienced delays/losses; pipeline is large but on-hand is zero so service risk remains. I set L explicit=3 to match observed reality so the OR engine sizes orders for the longer pipeline. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures full-sample demand and the longer lead-time scaling). This balances higher required pipeline coverage to avoid stockouts against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Given repeated confirmations and large in-transit balance, set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect reality. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the OR engine size base-stock against profit/holding tradeoff while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and existing pipeline.

To ensure pipeline covers demand during review+lead, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use dataset-wide estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures full-sample mean 95.6 and volatility). Methods chosen: L explicit to reflect confirmed LT=3; mu_hat and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)-scaled mean and std given L=3, balancing service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_48. Recent demand (Periods 43-47) averages ~74.4 units; on-hand=0, in-transit=376. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods. To ensure pipeline covers review+lead (1+L=4) future periods and to protect service given long lead times, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-to-moderate regime (mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands). I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to cover 4 periods of demand while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=376. Historical concludes show sustained evidence that actual lead time = 3 (multiple confirmed P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, etc.). Several late arrivals/lost shipments early justify explicitly using L=3. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) shows a higher mean and variability than the long-run seed samples, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime. These settings increase pipeline cover (1+L periods) to avoid stockouts while the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.
