Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "History shows high variability in actual lead time (observed 1\u20133) and prior lost shipments totaling ~262 units, but current state: on-hand=0 and in-transit=722. Using the OR base-stock math with sample mean demand \u2248114.4/day, (1+L)=3 gives \u03bc\u0302\u2248343.2; \u03c3\u0302\u224827 \u2192 base_stock\u2248388. Pipeline (in-transit+on-hand)=722 > base_stock, so no order required to meet target cover for (L+1)=3 periods. Given the sizable in-transit inventory and OR's capped recommendation of 0, I will not order now. I monitor for continued non-convergence of arrivals (lost shipments or lead-time > promised); if future concluded messages show missing portions of the 722, I will revise upward. Final action: order 0 units.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR (0 units): in-transit 722 exceeds base-stock need (~388 for 3 periods of demand), so no additional order now despite past inconsistent lead times/lost shipments.",
