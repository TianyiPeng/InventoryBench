Use carry-over confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods16\u201324 avg \u2248220 units/period) as demand anchor. With promised L=2 we target coverage for L+1=3 periods: 3\xd7220=660 units expected demand. Pipeline 647 is ~13 units short of a 3-period cover; given arrival uncertainty and profit>holding (q=0.8), place a small replenishment to provide a modest safety buffer without incurring large holding cost. Order 20 units. This minimally increases risk coverage (~+7% over the shortfall) while avoiding excess inventory if some in-transit units are lost or delayed. Follow-up: monitor next conclude messages to confirm arrivals and adjust if pipeline receipts deviate.",
