Because only a single multi-period pattern is confirmed, I will NOT record a sustained lead-time change but will treat some in-transit units as potentially unreliable. \n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate: Historical demands (P1\u2013P6) = [89,41,91,95,97,96], sample mean \u224884.8 units/period and sample std \u224821.7.

Recent realized demand (when not constrained) centers near ~100 units/period; OR recommends 0 because it uses promised LT and past samples but cannot see lost/delayed shipments.\nLead-time inference & pipeline reliability: Actual lead times have varied between 1 and 3 periods.

Strategy vs OR: OR's 0 is too conservative given supplier unreliability; I increase to 80 to ensure coverage despite delayed/lost shipments.\nRisk & monitoring: If P2 later concludes as arrived, we will adjust downwards; if more late/lost shipments appear, consider increasing safety stock in future periods.

{

Recent demand long-run average \u2248100 units/period (historical samples and recent periods). OR recommends 0 using promised L=2 and full history; it cannot see lost shipments. Risk analysis: With unreliable pipeline I will NOT count in-transit as reliable stock. I must cover demand for (L+1) \u2248 3 periods (current period demand occurs after decision and promised lead time is 2, actual lead time up to 3 observed). Estimated demand over 3 periods \u2248 3\xd7100 = 300 units. On-hand 169 covers ~1.7 periods; shortfall \u2248 131 units. Tradeoff: profit per unit ($19) >> holding cost per period ($1), so it's better to add safety stock rather than risk stockouts. Action: order 130 units to raise immediate available coverage toward the 3-period target while limiting exposure to additional holding cost given uncertain pipeline.
