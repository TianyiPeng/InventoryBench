  Mean: 99.8, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time (default) L=2. Demand history (118,130,72,58,121) shows no sustained regime change; use default population-based estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost given high unit profit ($19) relative to holding ($1).

Demand history available (samples: 118,130,72,58,121); no sustained regime change detected. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, balancing service level given high profit vs low holding cost.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=301, recent concluded messages show orders from P1 and P2 still not arrived (arrived=0). Evidence insufficient to confirm a sustained lead-time change (only two missed arrivals). Use promised lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples to avoid overfitting to short-term noise while the pipeline clears.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. Recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived=0 (no confirmed arrivals), on-hand=0 and in-transit=368. Given three consecutive non-arrivals beyond the promised lead time, I treat lead time as longer than promised to hedge against lost/delayed shipments. I set L explicitly to 3. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default formulas so the OR engine computes demand over the review+lead period using all samples (mean\u224899.8) and the appropriate multiplier for L=3. This balances service level (longer coverage) vs holding cost while letting the backend use its statistical estimates.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (ordered=154,147,67) all concluded with arrived=0 \u2014 suggests actual lead time >2 or lost shipments (observed over 3 consecutive periods).

Daily Profit: $1805.00, Daily Holding Cost: $126.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1679.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: recent sample mean demand = 99.8 (samples: 118,130,72,58,121). History shows mixed lead-time evidence (P1\u2192P4 lead_time=3, P3\u2192P4 lead_time=1) and several earlier periods with arrived=0 suggesting instability. On-hand(126)+in-transit(244)=370 units \u2014 comfortably covers (1+L)\xd7mean for L\u22482. Choice rationale: set L via recent_N (N=2) to reflect observed short-term average lead time (captures the 3 and 1 observations). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7overall mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on full sample set; this is conservative given demand history and current large pipeline. This balances service (avoid stockouts given uncertain lead time) against holding cost by relying on full-sample statistics rather than overfitting to noisy recent variability. No new sustained pattern (3+ periods) warrants a carry-over insight update.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1814.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6. Recent concluded lead times show variability (observed: P1\u2192P4 = 3, P3\u2192P4 = 1) so actual lead time appears average ~2. Demand history (Periods 1-5) mean \u224899.8 with no sustained regime change. Current on-hand=29 and in-transit=335 (large pipeline) \u2014 some prior delayed shipments have arrived and pipeline remains sizable. I select L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized delivery behavior; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine set a base-stock that balances the $19 profit against $1 holding cost given the inferred lead time and unchanged demand stats.

Daily Reward (R_t): $551.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=429. History shows mixed lead times: an order placed Period_1 arrived in Period_4 (lead_time=3) and an order placed Period_3 arrived in Period_4 (lead_time=1); several recent orders (Periods 2,5,6) have not yet concluded. Because observed lead times vary, I use 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times. For demand I use defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), letting the OR engine scale for the chosen L. This balances service (capturing longer observed lead time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and intermittent late arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1843.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=358. Historical demand samples mean=99.8 (Periods 1-5). Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4) and 3 (P4->P7) \u2192 average lead-time \u22482.33. I select L='calculate' so backend uses the observed-average lead time. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, scaling safety stock for the longer inferred lead time and balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding parameters. This addresses prior missing shipments by explicitly using observed lead-time data rather than the promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: Period1 order arrived in Period4; Period4 order arrived in Period7).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1683.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=27, in-transit=343. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 3-period arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) with occasional 1-period anomalies; recent pattern favors longer lead times. I set L using recent_N (N=3) to bias the lead-time estimate toward the most recent concluded arrivals (P4->P7=3, P5->P8=3, P7->P8=1). Demand history (samples 118,130,72,58,121) shows no sustained regime shift, so use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service (accounting for recent longer lead times) against holding cost given slim holding cost relative to profit.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. On-hand=0, in-transit=326. Historical concluded lead-times observed: {3,1,3,3,1,1} (avg=2.0) \u2014 evidence of variable lead-time with several 3-period arrivals but recent 1-period arrivals too. Demand samples (Periods 1-5): [118,130,72,58,121]. I select L='calculate' so the backend computes the average observed lead time (captures mixed signal objectively). I use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend applies (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), keeping forecasts tied to full historical demand given no sustained new demand regime. This balances service level vs holding cost while letting the backend account for the inferred lead time.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical conclude messages show multiple orders arriving with lead_time=3 (Period1\u2192P4, Period4\u2192P7, Period5\u2192P8) and some 1-period noise; multiple missing arrivals earlier indicate actual lead time longer than promised. I set L explicitly=3 to reflect observed lead time. I use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all provided demand samples, giving a conservative demand-across-review+lead forecast while leveraging observed lead time to cover the longer pipeline and reduce stockouts given delayed arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 decision. Recent demand has averaged ~95\u2013112 with occasional spikes to 140; on-hand=0, in-transit=474. Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (evidence: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7). Use explicit L=3 so the backend sizes orders for the longer realized lead time and avoids understocking. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving statistical grounding while accounting for L=3. This balances higher service level (profit>>holding cost) against holding cost given substantial pipeline.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: on-hand=64, in-transit=257. Historical concludes show multiple lead-time observations with frequent 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) but some 1\u20132 period samples; average observed lead time >2. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (captures recent mix while reflecting the frequent 3-period reality). Demand history provided is limited to the five sample points; no strong sustained demand regime change detected, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). This balances service (by acknowledging longer empirical lead times) against holding cost using the OR engine's base-stock formula.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent history shows actual lead time = 3 (confirmed P1->P4 and P4->P7). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=392 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals have been delayed historically. To reflect confirmed longer lead time I set L explicit=3 so backend sizes orders over a 4-period replenishment window. I use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it incorporate full sample history while accounting for the longer lead time. This balances higher safety stock (to avoid stockouts with L=3) against holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: recent concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14) with occasional 1\u20132 period observations. On-hand=0, in-transit=483 \u2014 pipeline appears healthy and likely covers upcoming demand. I select L by averaging observed lead times (method=calculate) to let backend infer the empirical mean lead time (~2.22). For demand parameters I use default formulas so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service level implied by profit vs holding cost while letting the OR engine apply capped ordering given the uncertain/variable lead time and existing large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=483. Historical concluded lead times = {3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3} (avg\u22482.22). Demand samples (Periods1-5) mean=99.8. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the observed >2 tendency while averaging variability). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, keeping forecasts grounded in full history given no clear, sustained demand regime shift. This balances service level (accounts for longer effective lead time) vs holding cost by increasing the review+lead forecast automatically via calculated L while using full-sample demand stats.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17 snapshot: on-hand=92, in-transit=348. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 3-period arrivals (several P\u2192P+3) but some 1\u20132 period events; average observed lead time ~2.3. Given the mixed but persistently frequent 3-period delays, use calculated average lead time so backend uses observed history. Demand history is volatile; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies full-sample estimates while accounting for inferred lead time. This balances service (captures longer observed delays) vs holding cost by letting OR compute target base-stock using observed lead-time-adjusted demand stats.

LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent history shows frequent 3-period arrivals (many P\u2192P+3) with some 1\u20132 period cases and earlier missing arrivals; on-hand=160, in-transit=252, profit=$19, holding=$1. I set L=calculate to let backend use the empirical average lead time (captures confirmed multi-period lead-time behavior including many 3s). For demand forecast I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (uses full historical demand 118,130,72,58,121).

Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the engine incorporate the longer inferred lead time while preserving demand sample information.

Concluded arrivals show variable lead times with multiple 3-period observations; average observed lead time \u22482.36. To account for realized lead-time drift and unknown lost shipments, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses empirical average (captures >2 behavior). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping forecast anchored to full-sample demand while the adjusted L increases pipeline coverage and reduces stockouts given delayed arrivals.

Use default demand/volatility calculation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all, leveraging all historical samples (Period_1..Period_5) to stabilize estimates given no clear recent demand regime shift. This increases pipeline coverage (reducing stockouts given observed LT=3) while letting backend cap orders to limit excess holding costs.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24. On-hand=0, in-transit=383. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent lead-time of 3 periods (many orders placed arrived after 3 periods), and several earlier multi-period delays/lost shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=3). Demand samples are limited; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the OR engine produce the base-stock while accounting for the inferred longer lead time and current sizeable pipeline.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25: on-hand=0, in-transit=426. Historical concluded messages show consistent 3-period arrivals across many orders (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P13->P16, P20->P23), indicating actual lead time = 3. Several earlier shipments were delayed or lost but recent pattern is sustained 3-period lead time. I set L explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to plan for the longer realized lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the available demand samples, allowing the base-stock calculation to balance the high profit vs. holding cost given the confirmed longer lead time and current in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=430. History shows multiple confirmed lead_time=3 observations (sustained). Use explicit L=3 to reflect observed reality and ensure pipeline coverage. Demand forecast: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to react to latest demand regime (more robust to recent spikes/declines than full-history defaults). This balances service (using observed L=3 and recent demand mean) against holding costs by avoiding over-reliance on older data.

LLM Rationale:
Current period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=430. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, etc.). To account for observed 3-period transit and avoid under-ordering, set L explicit=3. Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine incorporate the longer review+lead horizon while balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=448. Historical concluded arrivals strongly show actual lead time \u22483 most recently (many P1->P4, P4->P7, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23), though some shorter arrivals exist. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures mixed evidence but reflects confirmed 3-period pattern influence). Use default demand/volatility methods so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples respectively, letting the OR engine compute base-stock with the inferred L while preserving service/holding tradeoff given high in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=448. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=3 for many orders (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23 and others). Promised L=2 but evidence supports actual \u22483. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses empirical average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this leverages full history while the calculated L captures the longer lead time and keeps safety stock high enough to cover the extra period and avoid stockouts given high profit/low holding cost (q\u22480.95).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: recent history shows frequent arrivals delayed to 3 periods (multiple concluded messages confirm actual lead time=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=430 \u2014 pipeline is large but arriving with 3-period delay. To protect against stockouts given confirmed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3 so backend computes forecast over correct review+lead horizon. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L); this balances service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). No change to volatility estimate now since demand regime not convincingly shifted.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 confirmations). On-hand=0, in-transit=458 (pipeline present). To avoid repeated stockouts due to longer realized lead time, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend increases target coverage for the longer review+lead horizon while capping orders per its cap rule.

Given sustained evidence of LT=3, request backend to compute L from observed lead times (calculate). Use default demand aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this leverages full-sample stats while letting the backend incorporate the inferred lead time. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given LT=3 and large in-transit) versus holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=458. History shows multiple confirmed lead_time=3 observations (orders repeatedly arriving after 3 periods). Demand has trended to ~100+ in recent periods (Period28-32 demands: 107,116,117,148,98; recent mean \u2248117.2). To protect service given confirmed L=3 and recent higher demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (captures current ~100+ demand level and variability) so the OR backend raises target inventory and limits stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=531. Concluded history shows multiple consistent observations of lead_time=3 (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16, P14->P17, P20->P23), so I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering. Using default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) lets the OR backend compute base_stock and the capped order while leveraging the confirmed longer lead time; this balances service (profit=$19) against holding cost=$1 per unit by increasing pipeline coverage for the extra lead time without manually inflating safety stock.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=531. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, etc.), and several earlier missing arrivals confirm shipments are not arriving at promised L=2. Demand recent window (Periods 30-34 = 117,148,98,114,122) shows a higher near-term mean than the full-sample mean. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent regime, which captures the elevated recent demand while keeping parameters responsive to any short-lived shifts. This balances service level (avoid stockouts with longer true lead time) versus holding cost by focusing on recent demand evidence rather than the full historical series.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time.

Period 38: on-hand=0, in-transit=531. History shows multiple confirmed lead_time=3 observations (sustained across many concluded messages) and intermittent shorter arrivals\u2014overall signal supports using observed lead-time average. To preserve service given large in-transit pipeline and historical demand (mean ~100), I use calculated L to let backend infer average realized lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff and the large current pipeline. This approach is robust to occasional lost/delayed shipments because L is inferred from concluded arrivals and the backend caps orders conservatively.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Demand has been volatile but historical conclude messages show consistent lead_time=3 (multiple confirmations through Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=531 \u2014 significant pipeline exists but arrivals will be observed with the 1-period conclude delay. To account for the confirmed longer lead time I set L explicitly to 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, letting the engine adjust safety stock using profit/holding tradeoff while respecting the confirmed lead time.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=531. Historical concluded messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 3 (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P9->P12, etc.). Several earlier periods showed missing/delayed shipments consistent with LT=3. To ensure pipeline covers review+lead demand, I set L explicit=3 so the OR engine forecasts (1+L) periods appropriately. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) so the backend computes demand and uncertainty using full history; this balances service level given long confirmed lead time while avoiding excessive holding costs given current large in-transit volume.

I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, letting the model scale safety stock automatically given the longer lead time and the profit/holding tradeoff.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, keeping forecasts grounded in full-sample demand while the longer lead time increases coverage for variability and service level given high profit vs low holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=531. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 confirmations). Several earlier shipments were delayed/lost but recent pattern stabilizes at L=3. Given profit=19 and holding=1, I choose explicit L=3 so the backend forecasts over the correct pipeline horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively, leveraging full sample history while the correct lead time is enforced here to avoid underordering against the observed 3-period delay.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. On-hand=0, in-transit=531. Historical concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period lead times (multiple P->P+3 observations dominate), so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer current effective L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine scales demand and variability consistently with the chosen L; this balances service level (captures longer lead-time risk) versus holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations); on-hand=0, in-transit=531 (large pipeline). Demand samples (provided) have mean ~99.8. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend will infer the confirmed LT\u22483. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, which scales demand forecast and uncertainty for the longer lead time while the large in-transit pipeline provides coverage for near-term demand. This balances service level (capture LT=3) against holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. Recent concluded history shows a stable actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations). On-hand=0, in-transit=531 \u2014 significant pipeline exists but arrivals will be observed with the 1-period reporting delay. Demand history is ~100 units/period on average; no strong sustained regime change in last 3+ periods. To match observed lead time and avoid future stockouts, set lead time explicit=3 so OR orders cover (1+L) review+lead horizon. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples (conservative aggregation of historical demand), balancing service vs holding cost given high profit margin ($19 vs $1).

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=531. Historical concluded messages repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, etc.). To ensure the OR engine plans for the observed delays I set L explicit=3 so mu_hat/sigma_hat are computed over a review+lead horizon of 4 periods. Use default demand estimators (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L and sqrt(1+L)) so the backend leverages full historical demand while accounting for the confirmed longer lead time. No evidence of a new sustained demand regime; in-transit stock is sufficient to cover upcoming demand but longer lead time must be respected to avoid stockouts.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50. History shows repeated concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 (multiple confirmations across periods), and on-hand=0 with in-transit=531. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level given the longer confirmed lead time while keeping volatility estimation standard.
