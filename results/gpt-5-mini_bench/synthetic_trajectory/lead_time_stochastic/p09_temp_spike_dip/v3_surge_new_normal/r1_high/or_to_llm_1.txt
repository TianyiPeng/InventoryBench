  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Past concluded messages (Period 4 arrival from P1, Period 7 arrival from P4, etc.) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (already recorded in carry-over). Demand assessment: recent periods (P46\u2013P49: 142,117,113,133) average \u2248125 units/period. Required coverage = (L+1)=4 periods \xd7125 \u2248500 units. Inventory reconciliation: on-hand=0, in-transit=882 units, so pipeline already exceeds the 4-period demand cover (882 > 500). Ordering decision: place 0 units to avoid additional holding cost since existing in-transit inventory is sufficient and lead time is long (3), preventing rapid correction. Follow-up: monitor actual arrival timing in conclude messages to detect lost shipments or a new sustained demand shift.",
