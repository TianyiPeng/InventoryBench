Historical demand (Periods 1-5) avg=115.4 units/period; recent sample shows volatility but no sustained shift. Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals available, so assume actual lead time >=2. With lead_time=2, an order placed now will arrive in Period_3 and can only serve Period_3 demand and onward. To cover the (L+1)=3-period coverage guideline conservatively, forecast 3\xd7115\u2248346 units; round to 345 to avoid fractional rounding. Holding cost equals profit, so extra inventory beyond expected sales across periods yields little marginal benefit, but ordering to meet upcoming demand is needed to generate sales once arrivals occur.

No concluded evidence of lost orders. Inventory decision logic: given the large in-transit quantity (345) likely to arrive during this period and high holding cost ($1/unit/period) equal to profit/unit ($1), avoid adding more inventory now.
