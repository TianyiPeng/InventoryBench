Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Observed data: on-hand=0, in-transit=1998. Concluded history shows supplier lead time = 3 periods (confirmed previously). With L=3 the decision must cover demand for L+1=4 upcoming periods. Recent realized single-period demand (Periods 29\u201349) averages \u2248120 units; 4-period demand \u2248480 units. Pipeline (1998) materially exceeds that (1998 >> 480), so placing additional order only increases holding cost with no benefit. OR recommended 0; I agree and place 0 to avoid unnecessary holding cost while the large in-transit pipeline is expected to satisfy upcoming demand. No new sustained lead-time or demand-shift signals to record.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Follow OR: order 0 units \u2014 existing in-transit 1998 units far exceeds ~4-period demand (~480 units given L=3 and recent avg ~120), so ordering would only add holding cost.",
