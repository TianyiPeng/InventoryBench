There is currently no concluded evidence of a lead-time deviation or lost shipment, so assume promised lead time until proven otherwise.\n\nInventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=126 (ordered P1).

Rationale: pipeline (126) plus this order (143) brings future supply closer to the OR's target for the 3-period demand horizon without overreacting to an unconfirmed delay; we avoid over-ordering in case the P1 shipment is on-time and will cover a large portion of upcoming demand.
