Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=2. Use promised lead time (no concluded arrivals to infer otherwise). Historical demand mean = 97.2 units/period (samples P1-P5); set mu_hat and sigma_hat to defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This ensures orders target coverage of (L+1) periods of demand (3 periods) while backend's service-level sizing will reflect profit/holding tradeoff (q=0.8).

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=126 (order from P1), P1 conclude shows ordered=126 arrived=0 \u2014 single missed arrival but not yet sufficient to confirm lead-time change. Use promised lead time. Demand samples (110,116,74,101,85) mean=97.2 \u2192 (1+L)=3 implies target demand coverage \u2248291.6. Pipeline (126) + on-hand (0) is well below that target, so choose default demand/volatility settings so backend increases replenishment to cover 3 periods of expected demand while letting OR engine trade off profit vs holding cost.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=269 (orders from P1+P2). Promised lead time=2. No concluded arrivals yet (expected arrivals will be visible later), so do not infer lead-time change or lost shipments. Historical demand samples available (110,116,74,101,85); no sustained recent regime shift detected. Use default lead time to match promised L and let OR backend compute base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. All past three orders (ordered P1=126, P2=143, P3=79; total in-transit=348) have not concluded as arrived by their expected arrival windows, so actual lead time appears longer than the promised 2. To be conservative and cover demand while shipments are delayed, set explicit L=3 (expect arrivals one period later than promised). Use default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (samples mean=97.2). This raises the review+lead demand forecast and variability to protect service level while acknowledging holding cost tradeoffs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained shipment delays: orders placed P1,P2,P3 (126,143,79) remained unarrived by Period_3 conclude\u2014suggests actual lead time >=3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $355.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision at Period_5. Recent demand samples (110,116,74,101,85) have mean 97.2. Current inventory: on-hand 93, in-transit 258 \u2192 pipeline total 351, which already covers multiple periods of expected demand; however recent conclude shows at least one 3-period lead time (order P1 arrived in P4 with lead_time=3) alongside a 1-period arrival, so lead times are variable. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-time history (captures variability without overcommitting to promised L=2). For demand I use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to rely on full-sample average given no confirmed sustained demand regime shift. Sigma_hat uses default to reflect full-sample volatility. This balances service (accounting for longer observed lead time) against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $372.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6: on-hand=0, in-transit=370. Historical concludes show at least one order experienced a 3-period lead time (P1 arrived in P4), and other shipments have been delayed or inconsistent (P2 still unarrived). To be conservative given missed/late arrivals, set lead time to explicit 3 to ensure pipeline covers longer delays. Use default demand aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect full review+lead demand based on available samples; use default sigma_hat to scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This raises target base-stock to protect service level against late arrivals while accepting higher holding cost tradeoff.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 7. On-hand=0, in-transit=459. Historical concluded lead times observed: P1\u2192arrived at P4 (LT=3), P3\u2192arrived at P4 (LT=1) \u2192 average observed LT=2, which matches promised LT but shows variability and past sustained delays. Demand samples (periods 1\u20135): [110,116,74,101,85] (period 6 demand 102 also observed). To remain robust to lead-time variability while using confirmed data, I set L using calculate (average of observed lead times = 2). Given limited evidence of a persistent demand regime shift, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (by reflecting observed lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging large in-transit volume and past delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $185.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=55, in-transit=344. History shows observed lead times from concluded arrivals = [3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P4->P7)] indicating intermittent 3-period delays; pipeline is large but some orders previously delayed/lost. I set L=recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent observed lead-time average (~2.33) so the OR engine orders anticipating occasional 3-period arrivals. Demand estimates use default (no clear sustained demand regime change): mu_hat=default (uses all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and sigma_hat=default (uses all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances higher effective lead time risk versus holding cost given current large in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $63.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent demand has fallen vs earlier periods (demands last 8 periods: 139,114,117,112,102,102,60,46). On-hand=121 + in-transit=280 provides coverage but several past shipments experienced multi-period delays. Observed lead times from concluded arrivals: P1->P4=3, P3->P4=1, P4->P7=3, P5->P8=3; recent pattern is dominated by 3-period deliveries. I set L via recent_N to bias toward the most recent lead-time regime. For demand I use a recent_N window (N=5, periods 4\u20138) to capture the recent lower mean (112,102,102,60,46) so mu_hat reflects current lower demand. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices reduce over-ordering given confirmed longer lead times and lower recent demand while keeping safety for variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8)

Daily Reward (R_t): $456.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135): [110,116,74,101,85] with recent realized demands showing variability and several shipments taking 3 periods to arrive. Current on-hand=44, in-transit=232. Multiple concluded arrivals (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) confirm frequent 3-period deliveries though a few 1-period arrivals occurred; use observed average lead time to let backend balance these. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) to keep demand forecast anchored to full history while accounting for chosen L. This keeps ordering conservative given large in-transit inventory and confirmed longer lead times, reducing risk of stockouts while avoiding excessive additional orders.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11: recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (observed P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=375 which implies substantial pipeline inventory likely covering multiple future periods. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time so the OR backend forecasts over the correct review+lead horizon. I choose mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given long LT) against holding cost since we already have large in-transit stock and don't want aggressive extra ordering.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=352. Historical demand samples (110,116,74,101,85) mean=97.2. Observed concluded lead times: 3,1,3,3,1,2 \u2192 avg \u22482.17. Several multi-period delays observed (confirmed lead time=3 in prior carry-over). To account for the longer/variable lead time, set L via 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are computed consistently with chosen L; this balances service level (cover extra transit demand) versus holding cost given large in-transit pipeline and variable lead times.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_15. On-hand=11, in-transit=322. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P11->P14) so treat actual lead time as 3 to avoid stockouts. Use L explicit=3. For demand, no sustained recent regime shift in demand samples (base samples: 110,116,74,101,85), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These settings bias toward higher pipeline to cover the longer observed lead time and protect service level given high in-transit but remaining uncertain arrivals.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: recent demand average \u224897.13 units/period (15 samples). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple observations). On-hand=0, in-transit=418 which roughly covers a 4-period demand window (~389 units). To reflect confirmed longer lead time and use full-sample demand estimate I set L explicitly=3, mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to target service over the review+lead horizon, and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to capture observed volatility. This balances maintaining service (given long lead times and sufficient pipeline) while controlling holding cost by using the full-sample demand estimate rather than overweighting recent lower-demand noise.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=0, in-transit=382. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=3 periods (evidence in history). With profit=4 and holding=1, target service level q=4/(4+1)=0.8 so backend will compute z accordingly. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and ensure pipeline coverage for the (1+L)=4-period demand window. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all available demand samples\u2014this leverages full sample set while the explicit L corrects for persistent longer lead time and prevents under-ordering given large in-transit stock. Current pipeline (382) already likely covers near-term demand; using default demand estimates with corrected L balances service level vs holding cost without overreacting to recent single-period spikes.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=394. Recent concludes show multiple 3-period arrivals (P4, P7, P8, P14, P16, P17) indicating actual lead time \u22483 and several 1\u20132 period anomalies. Demand has risen sharply in the last 3 periods (P15\u2013P17: 103,163,167). To protect service while avoiding excess holding, I set L explicitly to 3 (match observed lead time). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of most recent 3 demands) and set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend builds a base stock for the 1+L review horizon using the recent elevated demand and its variability, while acknowledging delayed shipments in transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: avg demand before P15 (Periods 1\u201314) = 96.7; recent avg (P15\u2013P17) = 144.3 (+49%), sustained for 3 periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19: recent demand has shifted up (Periods 15\u201317 sustained higher demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=598. Historical concluded lead times show shipments often take 3 periods; to avoid stockouts I set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand I use a recent_N (N=3) forecast to capture the new higher regime (apply to (1+L) period forecast). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts given confirmed higher demand and 3-period shipments) while keeping holding risk controlled by using only the recent regime samples for mean/volatility.

Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=709, recent demand has shifted up (Periods 15\u201319 avg \u2248160). Multiple concluded arrivals show lead time = 3 consistently. To protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding, set L to be calculated from observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand periods to capture the new higher mean/volatility (1+L covers review+lead). This uses recent evidence (P15\u2013P19) so the OR engine will size base stock for the elevated demand and observed lead time.

To match the new high-demand regime while accounting for long lead time and large pipeline, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=6, Periods 15\u201320) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the confirmed higher-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22. On-hand=0, in-transit=709 (large pipeline of undelivered units). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained demand regime shift upward since Period 15 (mean \u2248144 vs prior \u224897). Given confirmed LT=3 and recent high demand, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-shift high-demand regime (last 5 demands reflect the new regime) so the OR backend builds a base-stock sized to meet elevated demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate order need.

On-hand=0 but large in-transit=719; many past orders confirmed with 3-period lead time. Set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. Use recent_N (N=8, P15\u2013P22) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (regime length 8), so the OR engine builds base stock for the elevated demand while accounting for current pipeline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: sustained higher demand since Period 15 (P15\u2013P23 mean \u2248163.4 vs earlier \u224896.7). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, etc.) and many delayed arrivals earlier; on-hand=0, in-transit=709. I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed lead time so pipeline coverage is computed correctly. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 15\u201323) to capture the new higher-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, letting the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the recent regime. This balances higher service level for increased demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand data.

To protect service given long in-transit and higher recent demand, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast and volatility use recent data from the elevated-demand regime (Periods 15\u201324, 10 samples) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most-relevant recent N=10 samples. This balances higher service needs versus holding cost given large existing pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=709. History shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 (multiple concluded P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 15 (recent mean ~144+, recent high-volume periods P15\u2013P25). Several earlier promised-2 shipments arrived with 3-period lag or later, so I use L=3 to reflect observed reality. Given the sustained high-demand regime, I use recent_N demand estimates using the 11 most recent post-changepoint samples (P15\u2013P25) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility. This ensures the base-stock and cap calculations are driven by current high demand while acknowledging longer lead time and large in-transit pipeline to avoid underordering or assuming lost shipments prematurely.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Recent concluded history shows multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (e.g., P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 15. On-hand=0, in-transit=709 (large pipeline outstanding). I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time and avoid underordering given overdue/lost-shipment risk. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (this leverages full historical demand while the explicit L corrects for lead-time mis-specification), balancing service level against holding cost given high pipeline volume.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 15 (higher mean ~144) and multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 (orders P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). On-hand is 0 and in-transit = 709 (large pipeline). Because actual lead time is 3, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new, sustained higher-demand regime; include the last 13 periods (Periods 15\u201327) where the regime persisted to compute (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std for the backend. This balances service (capture the higher mean demand) against holding cost given the already-large pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 15 (sustained). On-hand=0, in-transit=711 (large pipeline from prior orders). Historical concluded lead times show a mix but average > promised; use calculated average lead time to reflect realized behavior. For demand forecast use recent regime (Periods 15\u201328) to capture higher mean/volatility: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 to align base-stock to current demand while accounting for the long pipeline. These choices let the OR engine size orders for the elevated demand regime and reflect actual lead-time behavior, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Demand regime shift beginning Period 15 is sustained (higher mean). Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time so OR orders align with arrivals. Use recent_N (N=15, Periods 15\u201329) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given heavy recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

On-hand=0, in-transit=716 (large pipeline). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples so the base-stock and cap reflect the longer lead time and observed demand variability. This balances higher service level need under the elevated demand/longer lead time while relying on the engine's historical demand stats to temper ordering given the large current pipeline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 15 (sustained: avg P15\u2013P17 = 144.3; recent periods continue elevated demand ~150\u2013200). On-hand=0, in-transit=716 (large pipeline from past orders; several long delays observed historically). Lead-time history shows multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals earlier and some 2-periods more recently; to let backend reconcile systemic variability I request it compute the average observed lead time. For demand I use a recent_N approach over the post-shift regime to capture the sustained higher mean and volatility: set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 17 periods (Periods 15\u201331) so the base-stock covers (1+L) periods of the current high-demand regime and sigma reflects recent variance. This balances higher service level needed for large current demand versus holding cost by relying on recent data rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent demand has been on a higher regime since Period 15 (sustained ~144 avg). On-hand=0, in-transit=716 (large pipeline, some earlier shipments were delayed but many have arrived; risk of lost orders exists but pipeline is sizable). Lead time: historical concludes confirm actual LT=3 periods repeatedly, so I set L=3 to reflect observed reality and avoid underordering. Demand forecast: use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean; regime length from P15\u2013P32 = 18, so N=18. Volatility: use recent_N N=18 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices raise target base-stock to reduce stockouts under the higher-demand regime while L=3 prevents underestimation of pipeline needs; the large in-transit reduces immediate order quantity but we rely on recent-demand estimates to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. On-hand=0, in-transit=716 units. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 observations) and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning around Period 15 and persisting through Period 33 (many demands in 170\u2013200 range). Given confirmed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans across the correct pipeline. Use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 18\u201333 inclusive are 16 periods), so the base stock and safety stock reflect the elevated mean and volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts with large in-transit and high demand) against holding cost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Recent demand has stayed at the higher regime identified at Period 15 (sustained ~144 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=716 (large pipeline). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods; use explicit L=3 to reflect realized arrivals and avoid under-ordering. For demand forecast use recent regime data: set mu_hat to recent_N over the post-changepoint regime so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7mean of the current high-demand regime (N=20 covers Periods 15\u201334). Volatility has also shifted with the regime, so set sigma_hat recent_N with the same N=20. These parameters prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given high profit ($4) and large recent demand, while sigma_hat recent_N keeps safety stock tuned to current variability; explicit L prevents underestimation due to earlier lost/delayed shipments.

Period_36: recent demand has been elevated since the confirmed regime shift at Period_15 (sustained higher demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=716 (large pipeline). Multiple concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (orders observed P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8 and later confirmations). To ensure the OR engine accounts for the longer realized lead time I set L explicit=3. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-shift high-demand regime (use most recent 20 periods to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent variability. These choices balance service (covering the longer lead time and higher recent demand) against holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

Promised LT=2 but observed LT=3 repeatedly; therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent high-demand regime since Period_15; rule caps at 20) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 20 samples. Similarly set sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices protect service level under the higher sustained demand and account for longer realized lead times while keeping holding costs in mind given large in-transit volume.

Historical conclude messages confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods. To reflect confirmed LT and avoid stockouts given elevated demand, set L explicit=3. For demand forecast use recent_N on the most recent regime to capture the higher mean/volatility; regime length since P15 is 24, so N capped at 20. This gives mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 20 demand samples (more responsive to the sustained higher demand), balancing service level (reduce stockouts) against holding cost by using recent regime stats rather than stale earlier low-demand samples.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: on-hand=0, in-transit=716, profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical concludes show variable but average observed lead time > promised (many 3-period observations). Demand regime shifted up at Period 15 and has persisted; recent periods (P15\u2013P39) show substantially higher demand. I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures realized > promised). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base mu_hat on the confirmed higher-demand regime (uses most recent 20 samples to reflect new mean over review+lead). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to capture volatility in the recent high-demand regime. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using the inferred lead time and recent demand stats; the large in-transit (716) will be offset by pipeline when backend computes final order.

To respect observed lead time and the elevated demand regime, set L explicit=3. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 21\u201340 and back to P15 where regime persists), balancing service level against holding cost given large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_42. On-hand=0, in-transit=716. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P1->P4/P4->P7/P5->P8 observations and prior carry-over). Demand shifted up starting Period_15 and has remained elevated; to capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N over the most recent regime (capped at 20 samples) for both demand mean and volatility. These settings (L=3, recent 20 for mu and sigma) ensure the OR backend sizes the base-stock to cover the (1+L)=4-period demand under the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the backend's cap limit avoid excessive single-period receipts, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=716. Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times with many 3-period arrivals earlier and intermittent 1\u20132 period arrivals; average observed lead time >2. Demand underwent a sustained upward regime starting Period_15 (carry-over) and subsequent periods remain high. Reconcile: large in-transit suggests outstanding pipeline coverage but arrivals have been irregular. I set L to calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the post-Period_15 high-demand regime while respecting the N selection rule). For volatility I use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent higher variance. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet the persistent higher demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit holding cost given a large pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. Demand has been in the higher regime confirmed at Period_18 (P15\u2013P17 avg ~144). On-hand=0, in-transit=716 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show actual LT=3; I set lead time accordingly. To reflect sustained higher demand I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (regime since P15; available regime length >20 so cap N=20). This keeps the base-stock tuned to the elevated demand while using pipeline-aware L=3 so orders aren't understating required cover.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=716; historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period_15. Many earlier orders were delayed/lost but recent history (P15 onward) shows consistently higher demand. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. For demand I focus on the recent high-demand regime (use recent_N with N=20 to cover the most recent 20 periods of the sustained regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=20; this raises the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility to improve service while the large in-transit pipeline will be consumed, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=716. Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times but enough observations to compute an empirical average lead time; demand has been in the higher regime since Period_15. I choose L via 'calculate' (use average of observed lead times) so the OR engine treats lead time based on actual arrivals rather than the promised 2. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this leverages the full historical demand (including the sustained higher-demand regime) and keeps the policy consistent while the controller resolves the large in-transit balance. This balances service (by acknowledging longer actual lead time) against holding cost given currently large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=716. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 (multiple P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8). Demand regime shifted up at Period_15 and has persisted; recent periods (P15\u2013P46) show higher mean. To cover actual arrival delays I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I focus on the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to capture the sustained post-P15 mean over the last 20 samples. Use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend builds base-stock for the longer observed lead time and recent higher demand, reducing stockouts from delayed arrivals while balancing holding cost by using recent (not all-time) demand stats.

On-hand=0, in-transit=716 \u2014 with L=3 we must cover (1+L)=4 periods of demand; pipeline (716) already provides substantial cover but may be degraded by variability. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed observed lead time. For demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the post-change high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise). These choices align mu_hat/sigma_hat to the elevated demand regime and ensure the OR backend computes base-stock and a cap that balance higher service level needs against holding cost given the long lead time and existing large pipeline.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR engine orders for the correct pipeline duration. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use most recent 20 periods to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). Sigma uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align base-stock with the higher recent demand while accounting for longer lead time and avoiding understock from assuming promised lead time.
