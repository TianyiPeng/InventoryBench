No concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is still unconfirmed (could be \u22651 or lost). Do not assume arrival until a conclude message shows it.  \n2) Demand & OR comparison: Historical mean demand = (110+116+74+101+85)/5 = 97.2 units/period. With promised L=2, (L+1)\xd7mean = 3\xd797.2 = 291.6 units needed to cover current+L periods. OR's recommendation (143) reflects the capped base-stock adjustment (it capped the raw order to limit volatility). OR likely computed order_raw \u2248 291.6 \u2212 pipeline(126) \u2248 165.6 and then capped to 143.  \n3) Recent demand signal: Period 1 demand=139, substantially above historical mean but is only one period \u2014 not yet a sustained regime shift. However, it increases downside risk of stockouts if we under-order.  \n4) Inventory posture: On-hand=0, in-transit=126. To target approx. 291.6 pipeline+on-hand after our new order should be \u2248291.6. Therefore desired new order \u2248 291.6 \u2212 126 = 165.6 \u2248 166. This aligns with the uncapped base-stock gap and hedges the high observed demand while accepting modest extra holding cost.  \n5) Final decision: order 166 units (rounding 165.6 up to 166) to bring total committed inventory toward the (L+1)-period demand coverage. Monitor forthcoming conclude messages to confirm actual lead time or lost shipment; revise if arrivals confirm a different lead time or if high demand persists.",

Demand signal: recent uncovered demands are large (Period16 demand=163 observed with stockouts before/after; Period17=167, Period18=186 \u2014 censored by stockouts but indicate demand \u2248160\u2013185). Risk assessment: If actual lead time = 3 (seen repeatedly), we need pipeline + order to cover (L+1)=3\u20134 periods of demand until new order arrives and is observed. Using conservative recent demand \u2248160 units/period, target coverage for next 3 periods \u2248480 units. Current pipeline 473 almost meets that but may be ill-timed (arrivals distributed and some earlier orders were delayed); given lead-time variability and recent stockouts, a small replenishment now reduces risk of future lost sales if some in-transit shipments are further delayed or lost. Decision: place a replenishment order of 170 units. This provides a buffer (~+170 units) to cover an additional ~1 period of high demand and hedges against delayed/lost in-transit shipments. I diverge from OR's 0 because OR underestimates current demand and cannot see lead-time variability or delayed shipments.
