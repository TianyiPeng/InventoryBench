{
  "rationale": "Observed lead time: confirmed as 3 periods from concluded history (e.g., P1\u2192P4). With L=3 we must cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand after ordering. Recent demand regime (Periods 19\u201329 and onward) is ~146 units/period; using that, expected demand over 4 periods \u2248 584 units. Current pipeline (in-transit) = 607 units and on-hand = 0, so pipeline already exceeds the 4-period demand estimate (607 > 584). Profit and holding cost are equal (q=0.5 \u2192 no safety-stock uplift). OR recommended 0; given confirmed L=3 and sufficient pipeline to cover the next 4 periods, I follow OR and place 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding cost.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Follow OR (order 0): confirmed lead time = 3 and in-transit 607 units already covers ~4 periods demand (~584), so no new order to avoid holding cost.",
