Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Use promised lead time and population demand stats (no detected changepoint). Choose L default to use promised L=2; mu_hat default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples); sigma_hat default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service vs holding cost given symmetric profit=holding and no evidence of shifts.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (order placed P1) but no arrivals concluded yet \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time. Historical demand samples show moderate variability (samples provided). Promised lead time remains the best prior. To let the OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample demand stats while avoiding premature adjustments for a possibly delayed shipment, I use default lead time and default demand moments so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3. Recent concluded history shows two prior orders (149, 143) still not arrived; on-hand=0, in-transit=292. Historical demand samples mean=101.8/unit period. Because shipments appear delayed beyond the promised 2 periods (no arrivals in two conclude messages), I conservatively set lead time explicit=3 to force the OR engine to plan for a longer pipeline. Using default for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples so the base-stock reflects the longer review+lead horizon while letting the OR cap logic limit order size given uncertainty. This balances service-level (avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. History: Periods 1-3 concl: orders placed (149,143,126) totaled 418 in-transit but arrived=0 each conclude. On-hand=0, in-transit=418. No concluded arrivals observed yet, so actual lead time cannot be confirmed. Use promised lead time (default L=2). Demand history (all samples) mean=101.8; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat yields (1+L)-scaled estimates which reflect multi-period demand and keep policy aligned with OR engine assumptions. This also lets the backend recognize the large existing pipeline (418) and avoid over-ordering while we wait for arrival confirmations.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments from Period1-3: total ordered 418 units (149+143+126) with no arrivals observed by Period_3 conclude; suggests lost shipments or longer-than-promised lead time.

Daily Profit: $118.00, Daily Holding Cost: $157.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-39.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 start: on-hand=157, in-transit=143. History shows arrivals in Period_4: 149 (ordered P1, lead_time=3) and 126 (ordered P3, lead_time=1); the P2 order (143) has not concluded and remains outstanding. Observed lead times = {3,1} \u2192 use calculate (backend will average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(samples) respectively, letting OR engine incorporate the inferred L into demand-across-review+lead calculations. This balances service level vs holding cost by increasing coverage when calculated L> promised and otherwise relying on pooled historical demand variance. The decision acknowledges a potentially lost/delayed P2 shipment and relies on calculated L to raise required pipeline coverage.

Carry-over insight: Period_2 order (143 units) still missing by Period_4 conclude; possible lost or severely delayed shipment (no arrival observed for P2 order).

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start: on-hand=51, in-transit=271. Historical demand samples mean = (141+118+67+94+89)/5 = 101.8; recent demands show no sustained regime shift. Arrival history shows two observed lead times: P1\u2192arrived at P4 (lead_time=3) and P3\u2192arrived at P4 (lead_time=1); P2 order still missing as of Period_5 conclude. To account for observed variability in lead time, set L via calculate (average of observed lead times = (3+1)/2 = 2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages all data while letting the backend inflate safety stock for the longer inferred lead time. This choice balances service (protects against the occasional 3-period delay) vs holding cost given current moderate on-hand + large pipeline.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 7. History shows mixed actual lead times: observed arrivals indicate lead_time=3 (P1\u2192P4) and lead_time=1 (P3\u2192P4); promised=2. On-hand=5, in-transit=377 (large pipeline, some past orders heavily delayed). Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the 1 and 3 observations). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes demand over (1+L) periods from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline and uncertain lead time. This approach avoids overreacting to incomplete/lost shipments while increasing protection for longer realized lead times.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean 101.8 units; on-hand=0, in-transit=401 (many outstanding orders, some delayed). Concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed 3 and 1), so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all available samples scaled by (1+L) which balances service level vs holding cost given current pipeline depth and moderate demand variability. This keeps ordering conservative while the backend caps order size using its cap formula and the inferred L.

Daily Profit: $103.00, Daily Holding Cost: $49.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: observed concluded lead times: P1->3, P3->1, P5->3, P7->1 (avg=2.0). One earlier order (P2) remains missing beyond expected arrival \u2014 treat as isolated lost/delayed shipment but not yet a sustained lead-time regime change. On-hand=49, in-transit=249 so pipeline is substantial. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent mix of 1 and 3 period arrivals -> avg 2). For demand I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) which smooths over historical variability and ensures cover for (L+1) periods. For sigma_hat use 'default' to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (covering L+1 periods of demand given uncertain arrivals) against holding cost, while remaining conservative about the single missing shipment rather than overreacting to it.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=352. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 3 (P1,P5) and 1 (P3,P7) \u2014 average around 2, so use 'calculate' to let backend infer average observed lead time. Demand samples (141,118,67,94,89) show mean ~101.8; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) keeps forecasts aligned with historical demand while letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost. This approach accounts for variable realized lead times and avoids overreacting to intermittent missing shipments.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand sample series available (Periods 1-5). No sustained change in demand regime or lead time beyond the alternating 1/3 pattern; average lead time aligns with promised 2. I select L by calculation to reflect observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=411. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed: P1->P4 LT=3, P3->P4 LT=1, P5->P8 LT=3, P7->P8 LT=1) indicating variable actual lead times with mean ~2. Several earlier shipments were delayed beyond the promised 2-periods but later arrived, so use an empirically-derived lead time. I choose L=calculate to let backend use average of observed lead times (captures the 1 and 3-period realizations). For demand forecasting use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples; this leverages all historical demand (Periods 1-5 samples) while letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding. The large in-transit volume (411) will be considered by the backend when computing final order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead times from concluded arrivals: Period1->Period4 = 3, Period3->Period4 = 1, Period5->Period8 = 3, Period7->Period8 = 1; average observed lead time = 2 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: on-hand=65, in-transit=259. Historical concluded lead times show variability but average ~2.17 (multiple observed arrivals at 1,2,3); several earlier shipments were delayed but recent pattern averages to ~2. Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand history (samples: 141,118,67,94,89) used by backend; to avoid overfitting to short-term noise and to let OR engine apply its base-stock formula with promised lead-time knowledge, select mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding so q=0.5 and caps are applied by OR engine.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_14 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Concluded arrivals yield observed lead times = {3,1,3,1,3,2} (avg \u22482.17) so actual lead time centers near 2. To let the OR engine incorporate observed lead-time evidence while using full historical demand samples, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (captures slightly >2 actual lead time) while avoiding overfitting short recent spikes given limited data.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical concluded lead times (P1->P4=3, P3->P4=1, P5->P8=3, P7->P8=1) give average observed L\u22482, matching promised L=2. Recent history shows earlier missing arrivals but arrivals since Period4/8/12 confirm lead-time variability averaging 2. Use default lead time (promised) to keep OR engine assumptions aligned with observed average. Demand samples (provided) have mean=101.8; with L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost given a large in-transit position (397 units) \u2014 defaults avoid overstating immediate extra orders while allowing backend cap to limit order size.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=397. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed sequence: 3,1,3,1,3,2,3) with average \u22482.28 but centered near 2; promised lead time=2. Pipeline (397) is large relative to recent demand samples; to reflect observed variable lead times I let backend calculate L from observed lead times. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus forecast on most recent demand regime and reduce influence of early outliers, and default sigma_hat so backend computes volatility over all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (capture longer observed lead times) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=368. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: P13-17 = 118,111,77,273,170) so I use a recent-demand estimate to capture the current regime. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 3) with average ~2 \u2014 use calculate so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std reflect the most recent demand regime and respond to the recent spike while avoiding overreacting to a single period. This balances service level (cover higher recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and lead-time variability.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=600. Historical concluded lead times show a mix (many 3-period observations, some 1-2) with average ~2 \u2014 use calculated average lead time to let backend reflect observed variability. Large in-transit balance suggests shipments en route; I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the OR engine compute base-stock and cap given the inferred L. This balances service level (using observed longer L) against holding cost given current large pipeline and volatile demand history.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=600. Recent concluded arrivals show many 3-period lead times (P1->P4, P5->P8, P9->P12, P11->P14, P13->P16, P14->P17) indicating actual lead time longer than promised. To protect service while in-transit is large, set L explicitly to 3 to make mu_hat/sigma_hat cover a 4-period demand window. Use default demand estimates (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies its standard safety-stock formula with the longer lead time. This balances higher stocking need from confirmed longer lead time against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods: observed arrivals P1->P4 (3), P5->P8 (3), P9->P12 (3), P11->P14 (3), P13->P16 (3), P14->P17 (3); consistent 3-period arrivals across multiple orders.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: recent demand has been high and variable (Periods17-20 demands = 170,232,116,164; mean=170.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=600 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 3-period lead time. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 (the four most recent demand periods) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and scales volatility from the same recent window; this targets service during the 4-period review+lead horizon while using the most relevant recent demand signal and acknowledging substantial in-transit inventory to avoid over-ordering.

Use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively, letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost with the updated L.

LLM Rationale:
Period_23. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals); on-hand=0, in-transit=682 (covers upcoming demand but arrivals arrive with 1-period observation lag). Demand has shifted higher in recent periods (notably P16=273, P18=232, P21=180, P22=189). To reflect the confirmed longer lead time use explicit L=3. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (last 7 demand samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent regime and balances service level vs holding cost given current large in-transit position.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=675 \u2014 large pipeline likely from past orders but arrival confirmations lag by one period. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time so the OR backend plans for a 3-period pipeline. I use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs holding cost given uncertain demand and high in-transit volume. This addresses missing/delayed shipments by explicitly modeling the longer lead time.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=0, in-transit=675. History shows consistent 3-period arrivals for many concluded orders (multiple P->P+3 confirmations), so I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Demand has shifted up sharply since Period_18 (sustained high demand through Period_24), so I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new regime. I choose N=7 (Periods 18\u201324) because that is the detected recent high-demand regime length (7 periods) and meets the 3+ periods sustained rule. These parameters increase target base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated volatility; using calculate for L ensures pipeline coverage aligns with observed 3-period lead times despite promised=2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: avg demand increased from ~102 (Periods 1\u20135 sample mean) to ~183 (Periods 18\u201324 mean) (+79%), sustained for 7 periods.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=647. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period lead times across many orders (multiple P->P+3 observations) and demand shifted up at Period 18 and has remained elevated. To reflect confirmed longer lead time I let L be calculated from observed lead times. For demand I target the recent high-demand regime (Periods 18\u201325) using recent_N with N=8 (regime length=8) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher mean and volatility; this helps the backend set a higher base stock to avoid stockouts given long effective lead time and elevated demand while capping orders to control holding costs.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. On-hand=0, in-transit=718. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent 3-period lead-time behavior since Period 20, so use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. Demand regime shifted up at Period 18 and has persisted through Period 26 (regime length = 9 periods); therefore forecast demand using the most recent 9 samples to capture the higher mean and volatility. These choices (calculate L, recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9) bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to meet elevated demand while reflecting current observed lead time and recent volatility, reducing stockouts despite holding costs.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 18 (~183 avg). On-hand=0, in-transit=718 (large pipeline) and historical concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period lead times (multiple P->P+3 confirmations). Some earlier orders were delayed but the pattern is now stable. I therefore set lead time explicitly to 3 to match observed behavior. For demand I use a recent_N forecast using the last 10 periods (Period 18\u201327) which captures the sustained higher-demand regime; same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. This ensures the OR backend sizes base stock to cover the review+lead horizon under the confirmed higher-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline reduces urgency to over-order.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=647. Historical concluded arrivals show lead times clustered at 3 periods in recent history and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period_18 (higher mean ~183). In-transit inventory (647) covers multiple periods of elevated demand; we should tell the OR engine to use observed lead-time behavior and focus demand forecast on the post-change regime. Set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times so the backend uses empirical average. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (Periods 18\u201328 inclusive) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (capture higher demand) while the large in-transit stock will limit new ordering by the capped policy.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: recent demand regime is the higher post-Period-18 level (sustained elevated demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=677 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary but average ~2 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=13) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime from Periods 18\u201329. Sigma uses recent_N (N=13) to reflect recent volatility. These choices align base-stock with the new demand level while accounting for observed lead-time behavior and large in-transit inventory.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=687. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period lead times since Period_20 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_18 (higher mean). To reflect the confirmed longer lead time and recent higher-demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=13) covering Periods 18\u201330 to capture the post-shift mean for (1+L)-period demand. Use recent_N (N=13) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings align orders with the observed 3-period arrivals and prioritize service during the higher-demand regime while the large in-transit stock will be managed by the OR cap.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=0, in-transit=718. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times vary and recent long runs of 2\u20133 periods; use calculated average lead time so backend infers realized behavior. Demand has clearly shifted up since Period 18 and recent five periods (P27\u2013P31 demands: 122,147,219,205,227) show a higher regime; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current elevated mean and volatility. These settings bias base-stock toward meeting the new higher demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and large in-transit stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 33. On-hand=0, in-transit=687 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but multiple sustained 3-period arrivals earlier and a sustained demand regime shift upward at Period 18. Use lead-time estimate derived from observed history (let backend compute average observed lead time). For demand, use recent samples within the high-demand regime (Periods 18\u201332, length 15) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean; match sigma_hat to the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher sustained demand while the OR backend caps order size and balances holding cost.

Demand shifted up around Period_18 and has remained elevated; use recent_N with N=16 (Periods 18\u201333) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher mean and volatility so the OR backend will size base stock to meet (1+L) periods of the higher demand while accounting for current pipeline.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=0, in-transit=700. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time has settled to ~3 periods (multiple P->P+3 arrivals confirmed) and demand underwent a sustained upward shift starting Period 18 (higher mean since then). Reconcile: large pipeline (700) likely covers multiple periods of the higher demand, but on-hand is zero so we must forecast using the post-shift demand regime. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead times (avoids underordering if backend assumes promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean from the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 18\u201334) so mu_hat reflects current higher demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=17 so variability is estimated from the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service (reduce stockouts) while letting the OR engine cap orders with its cap to mitigate excess holding given the large in-transit volume.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 18 (sustained elevated demand). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=733 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show persistent 3-period lead times across many orders; recent patterns and carry-over evidence indicate actual lead time is best modeled as 3. I set L explicitly to 3 to ensure orders cover the longer arrival delay and to avoid stockouts. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=18) to capture the post-change high-demand regime (Periods 18\u201335) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean over the sustained regime. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=18) to capture recent demand volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to maintain service given confirmed longer lead time and higher sustained demand while the large in-transit volume will be accounted for by the backend pipeline term.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37: on-hand=0, in-transit=742. Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained actual lead time of 3 periods (multiple P->P+3 observations). Demand regime elevated since Period 18 (sustained high demand). I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering given missing/delayed shipments. For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 18\u201336) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility I use recent_N N=19 to reflect recent demand variability. This combination directs the OR backend to target a larger base-stock (covering (1+L) periods of the higher demand) and increases safety stock to balance service with holding cost given high in-transit and confirmed longer lead times.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=705. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times but multiple confirmed 2\u20133 period arrivals and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 18 (higher demand since). To ensure pipeline covers review+lead demand under observed variability, set L to 'calculate' (average of all observed lead times). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecasts on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 18\u201337 length \u224820), so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show average observed lead time \u22482 (multiple confirmed 2\u20133 period arrivals); demand regime shifted up around Period_18 and has been sustained (~183 avg). To reflect sustained higher demand, set mu_hat using recent data from the post-changepoint regime (last 20 periods) and match sigma_hat to the same recent window. Use 'calculate' for L so backend uses observed lead times average. This ensures the base-stock targets the higher recent demand while volatility is estimated from the same regime; large pipeline is noted but may include delayed shipments so we keep forecasting based on recent realized demand.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=705. Historical concluded arrivals show lead times varying but recent multi-period evidence supports a longer-than-promised lead time and occasional 3-period arrivals. Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period_18 (avg ~183); recent periods show continued high demand (~180\u2013230). To capture the confirmed longer lead-time signal I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded data (method=calculate). For demand I use recent_N=20 to capture the post-Period_18 high-demand regime (N=20 covers the sustained high-demand window while smoothing short-term noise). I set sigma_hat recent_N=20 to reflect recent volatility under the new regime. These choices keep pipeline targets aligned with observed lead-time behavior and prioritize service during the higher demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from observed lead-time and demand statistics.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=709. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained longer lead times (multiple orders with 3-period arrivals) and a sustained demand regime shift upward since ~Period 18. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period actual lead time (avoids under-ordering and accounts for delayed arrivals in transit). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (uses the most recent 20 demand observations to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent high variance. These choices increase target pipeline to cover (L+1) periods of the higher demand while using recent data to balance service level against holding cost given high in-transit stock.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=769. Historical concluded lead times show many 3-period arrivals but overall average close to 2\u20133; demand regime shifted up around Period_18 and has remained high (~180s). To capture the true lead-time behavior I let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use a recent-window estimate to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 20 periods to capture post-changepoint mean and volatility). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR engine sizes base stock for the higher demand while L calculated from observed lead times helps account for delayed arrivals; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding so q=0.5.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=769. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent multi-period lead times (many 2\u20133 period arrivals, earlier analysis confirmed sustained 3-period pattern) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period_18 (higher mean \u2248183). Pipeline (769) is large relative to recent demand; some earlier orders were delayed but recent history shows consistent arrivals. I choose L by 'calculate' so the backend uses observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (reflects actual 2\u20133 period behavior rather than the promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to base mu_hat on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (captures the post-Period_18 higher mean). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=20) to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service given the higher recent demand while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering given delayed arrivals; using recent samples keeps safety stock responsive to the sustained regime shift while the large in-transit volume limits aggressive additional orders.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=765. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent 3-period lead times (multiple P->P+3 confirmations); carry-over evidence already records LT=3. Demand elevated since Period 18 (carry-over: avg ~183 vs ~102 earlier); recent periods consistently high. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time (prevents under-ordering vs promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (uses most recent 20 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean). Sigma uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods, insulate against delayed arrivals, and let the OR backend compute a higher base-stock to trade off service vs holding cost given the confirmed higher demand and longer lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period_18 (higher mean ~180+). On-hand=0, in-transit=729 \u2014 sizable pipeline but past behavior shows actual lead time=3 (many concluded 3-period arrivals) and occasional lost/delayed shipments. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time so the OR engine forecasts over the correct horizon. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 18\u201344 provide a long, stable high-demand sample; N capped at 20). This balances service (capturing elevated demand) against holding cost while accounting for the longer lead time and in-transit pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: recent concluded history shows persistent actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmations) and a sustained demand regime shift since Period 18 (higher mean ~183+). On-hand=0, in-transit=782 (large pipeline). I set L explicit=3 to align the OR backend with observed lead time (promised=2 but arrivals consistently at 3). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (most recent demands: P41\u2013P45) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand, longer-lead-time regime while the large in-transit volume limits additional over-ordering.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=842. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times cluster at 3 periods recently (multiple confirmed P->P+3 arrivals), so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_18 (sustained elevated demand); to capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N with N=20 (covers most recent sustained samples). Using recent_N for sigma ensures volatility reflects the recent regime. These settings steer the OR engine to a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given large in-transit volume and confirmed longer lead times while controlling holding costs by relying on recent demand statistics.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=842. Historical concluded lead times show many 3-period arrivals with average >2 (calculated below); demand has been in the higher regime since Period 18. To reflect observed longer-than-promised deliveries while letting the OR engine compute demand across review+lead, I ask the backend to compute L from observed lead times (calculate) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so mu/sigma scale with the chosen L and full sample mean/std. This balances higher service-level needs from long lead times and sustained higher demand against holding cost; large in-transit stock already partially covers upcoming demand.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=842. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent 3-period lead times in many recent orders (multiple P->P+3 confirmations), so I avoid trusting the promised L=2 exclusively. Demand has stayed in the higher regime since Period_18 (~180+ per period); recent periods (P29\u2013P48) continue to show high demand (~200s). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history to reflect the frequent 3-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while focusing on the most recent data to reflect current volatility and mean. This balances service level (protect against stockouts given high recent demand and long observed lead times) versus holding cost by relying on recent data rather than all historical low-demand periods.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50. Recent demand is high: last 5 demands (Periods 45\u201349) average \u2248220 units/period; long-run regime shift to higher demand confirmed earlier. On-hand=0 but in-transit=842 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show lead time ~3 periods repeatedly, so I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility; this keeps the base_stock responsive to elevated demand while the OR backend applies caps. These choices address missing/delayed shipments by assuming longer lead time and using recent demand to prevent underordering.
