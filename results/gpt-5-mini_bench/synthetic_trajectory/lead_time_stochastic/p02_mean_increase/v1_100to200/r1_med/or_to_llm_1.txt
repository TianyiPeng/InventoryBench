Inventory & demand analysis: single-period demand mean from provided samples \u2248 101.8 units.

Rationale: current combined inventory already covers (L+1)=3 periods of demand under promised L=2 and also covers expected demand if actual lead time drifts to 3 periods; placing the small OR order would increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) without materially reducing stockout risk. Also avoid adding inventory while lead-time uncertainty persists and pipeline is adequate.

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded arrivals show a consistent 3-period lead time (evidence: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12 and carry-over insight). Therefore treat actual L=3 (so decision must cover current + next 3 periods = 4 periods of demand). Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=0, in-transit=845. Recent realized demands (Periods 29\u201349) are high (many values ~200\u2013237); using a conservative single-period demand \u2248210 implies 4-period demand \u2248840. Pipeline (845) roughly equals expected 4-period demand, so pipeline already covers the (L+1) coverage target. Cost tradeoff: profit/unit=$4, holding=$1 \u2014 high service target, but additional ordering now would create holding cost on arriving units and risks overstock if pipeline arrives. OR recommended 0; I override only if pipeline coverage is insufficient or lead time shorter. It is sufficient given L=3. Final strategy: place 0 units this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while awaiting in-transit arrivals and re-evaluate next period when actual arrive-concludes are visible.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Follow OR (0 units): actual lead time is 3 and in-transit 845 \u2248 4\xd7~210 demand covers the required (L+1)=4 periods, so no order to avoid extra holding cost.",
