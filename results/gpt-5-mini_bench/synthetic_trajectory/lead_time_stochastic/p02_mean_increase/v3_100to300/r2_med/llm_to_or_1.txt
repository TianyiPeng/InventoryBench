Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start, no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) available but no evidence of regime change or lead-time shifts. Promised lead time will be used. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=147, last concluded (P1) shows ordered=147 arrived=0 which is consistent with promised lead time=2 (no evidence of accelerated or lost shipment). Historical demand samples mean ~100.6. With promised L=2, the review+lead horizon is 3 periods; current pipeline (147) is short of 3-period expected demand (~302), so we keep defaults to let OR backend compute base_stock and caps using full-sample stats while monitoring future concludes for lead-time or demand regime shifts.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=300, and two concluded periods show no arrivals for recent orders \u2014 possible delays but insufficient (needs \u22653 periods) to confirm sustained lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid overreacting. Historical demand samples (88,148,80,84,103) will be used by backend; default mu_hat and sigma_hat (which compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std) balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. Keeping defaults avoids assuming lost shipments while pipeline is large (300 units).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=348 (orders placed P1-P3). No concluded arrivals have been observed for orders placed in Periods 1-3, so actual lead time is uncertain but not yet confirmed. Use promised lead time (default) and demand priors from all historical samples (Periods 1-5) to let the OR engine compute base_stock and caps. This balances service (keep replenish given large in-transit) while avoiding manual overrides until arrivals/lead-time are confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (total in-transit=348) have not concluded by Period_3 conclude; possible prolonged/delayed shipments\u2014monitor for confirmation.

Daily Profit: $548.00, Daily Holding Cost: $58.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $490.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision: observed recent concluded arrivals show mixed actual lead times (order from P1 arrived in P4 -> LT=3; order from P3 arrived in P4 -> LT=1). Demand history (periods 1-5: 88,148,80,84,103) shows no clear regime shift. On-hand=58 + in-transit=160; some earlier orders were delayed but now partial arrivals confirmed. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the recent mix of 3 and 1). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of a sustained demand change. This approach cautiously accounts for variable lead times while avoiding overreaction to limited signals of demand change or shipment loss.

Daily Reward (R_t): $232.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=314. Recent demand (Periods 1-5) shows no clear sustained shift (demands observed: 134,79,124,137,87). Arrival history shows mixed lead times (one order with lead_time=3, one with lead_time=1); average observed lead time = 2, which matches the promised lead time. To balance service level given in-transit uncertainty, set L to the calculated average of observed lead times so the OR engine accounts for realized delays. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all recent samples (no strong changepoint detected).

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7. Recent sample demands (Periods 1-5): [88,148,80,84,103]; recent actual arrivals show variability in lead time (observed: P1\u2192arrived P4 => LT=3; P3\u2192arrived P4 => LT=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=465 \u2014 multiple past orders remain undelivered or delayed. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the longer-than-promised shipment seen). For demand forecast and volatility I use default methods so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), keeping forecasting conservative given demand history and arrival uncertainty. This balances service (higher base stock when L increases) against holding cost amid uncertain deliveries.

Daily Profit: $28.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $28.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=460. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: P1->P4 (3), P3->P4 (1), P4->P7 (3) => observed lead times = [3,1,3], average \u22482.33. Demand history (periods 1\u20137) shows variability but no sustained (>3 periods) mean shift. Several earlier orders were delayed/overdue but some later orders did arrive (including two 3-period arrivals), so I use the empirical average lead time. Choices: set L using 'calculate' (average of observed lead times) to reflect realized delays; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the base-stock formula and cap handle service/holding tradeoff given the longer inferred lead time. This also keeps forecasts robust to noisy demand without overfitting short-term fluctuations. I note pipeline is large (460) so orders should be sized down by the backend's pipeline offset.

Daily Reward (R_t): $274.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=70, in-transit=304. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) plus occasional 1-period arrivals; average observed lead time ~2.2. Several earlier orders were delayed but now pipeline=304 provides cover. I choose L by calculate to let backend use observed lead times average. For demand I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to remain robust to limited sample size while letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost. This approach hedges against prolonged shipments by increasing effective lead time used in forecasting without overfitting short 1-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed arrivals: Period1\u2192Period4, Period4\u2192Period7, Period5\u2192Period8).

Daily Reward (R_t): $160.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 10, on-hand=24, in-transit=378. Observed concluded lead times show repeated 3-period deliveries (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) though some 1-period arrivals occurred; average observed lead time is >2 so use calculated average. Demand has dropped in the last 3 periods (Periods 7-9 demands = 48, 86, 46), indicating a recent lower-demand regime; use recent_N=3 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stock for the new regime while accounting for the longer observed lead time and existing large pipeline.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=378. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple lead_time=3 observations (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8) despite some 1-period arrivals; recent pattern and prior confirmation indicate effective lead time is 3. Use L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so backend orders cover (1+L) review+lead periods. Demand samples provided are the five-sample series; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) under the confirmed longer lead time and current large in-transit volume.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=428; recent conclude messages (Periods 4,7,8) confirm actual lead time = 3. Demand history shows no sustained regime shift. To ensure the OR backend plans for the confirmed longer transit and covers current+lead periods, set L explicit=3 so base-stock uses (1+3) periods. Use default demand estimates (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) to leverage full-sample mean/std while accounting for the explicit L. This addresses past missing/delayed shipments by adopting the observed lead time rather than the promised 2.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=6, in-transit=358.

Many earlier orders were delayed but have since arrived; pipeline is large enough to cover multiple periods. I choose L=calculate to have the backend infer the average observed lead time (captures confirmed 3-period pattern). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=419 \u2014 some shipments are overdue historically but recent concludes confirm L=3. Use explicit L=3 to reflect realized lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history (captures overall demand and variance while the explicit L handles delayed arrivals). This balances service (longer lead coverage) vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=0, in-transit=380. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple lead_time=3 observations (Period1\u21924, 4\u21927, 5\u21928, 9\u219212, 11\u219214) \u2014 lead time effectively 3. Several earlier short (1) leads exist but the sustained pattern is 3. To ensure pipeline covers demand over review+lead, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) using full history; this balances service level given confirmed longer lead time while letting backend apply statistical safety stock based on profit/holding tradeoff. This choice also accounts for large in-transit volume and avoids double-counting by relying on backend's pipeline handling.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=0, in-transit=426. Historical concluded arrivals show predominantly 3-period lead times (multiple P\u2192P+3 confirmations) with occasional 1-periods; recent observations (last 5) average ~2.6 so I use recent_N=5 to capture the current slower regime. Demand recent 5 periods (P11\u2013P15) average \u2248105.8; I set mu_hat recent_N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service needs from confirmed longer lead times against holding cost by anchoring forecasts to the most recent demand regime.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=401. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 confirmations). No sustained demand regime change (recent spike at P16 is single-period). To ensure pipeline covers demand over review+lead, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (capture observed LT=3) against holding cost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=503. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 3-period actual lead time (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P12\u2192P15, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). Given sustained LB=3, set L explicitly to 3 so the OR engine plans for the longer arrival delay. Use default demand estimators (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the sample set\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost conservatively without overreacting to recent single-period spikes.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: on-hand=0, in-transit=600. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently = 3 periods (multiple confirmed observations). Recent demand (Periods 16-18 = 368, 297, 251) shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 16. To capture the new regime I set L by calculation from observed lead times and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility of the three most recent, high-demand periods. This balances higher service needs from the new demand regime while leveraging the large pipeline to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand before Period 16 (Periods 1-15) = 95.4, avg demand Periods 16-18 = 305.3 (+220%); Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (multiple observed: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, etc.)

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (high demand: P16=368, P17=297, P18=251, P19=177). Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u22483 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1003 (large pipeline expected to cover upcoming demand but arrivals are observed with multi-period delay). Choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (evidence supports L\u22483). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (Period16-19) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Use sigma recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These settings prioritize service (higher base stock) in the new high-demand regime while the OR engine's cap limits extreme orders to control holding costs.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period_16 (Periods 16-20 mean demand\u2248289.8). Multiple conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1229 (large pipeline covering multiple future periods). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (captures current mean ~289.8 and variability), which balances service (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 16 with much higher demand (Periods 16-21 avg \u2248 286.7 vs earlier \u224895). Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit large (1292) so pipeline is strong but lead time remains 3. I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (Periods 16-21) to capture the new high-demand regime and its volatility so the OR backend will target higher base stock and appropriate safety stock while avoiding over-weighting older low-demand data.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: on-hand=0, in-transit=1306. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (Periods 16-22 mean \u2248 292.9 vs earlier mean \u224895.4). To capture confirmed longer lead time I let backend calculate L from observed lead times. For demand I use a recent_N forecast focused on the post-changepoint regime (N=7, Periods 16-22) so mu_hat reflects the higher demand; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=7) to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices increase order coverage for the larger, persistent demand while acknowledging proven lead-time delays and avoiding under-ordering given heavy in-transit volume.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=0, in-transit=1003. History shows sustained higher demand since Period_16 (large spike; recent periods 16-23 consistently high) and multiple confirmed arrivals indicating actual lead time = 3 periods. Reconcile: large pipeline (1003) likely covers several future periods but lead time remains 3; to capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 8 periods (Periods 16-23). Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time and avoid underordering from assuming promised value. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=8 to align the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility with the new high-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given high profit-to-hold ratio.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period_16 (high demand through Period_24). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the 9-period high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201324), so the OR engine's base-stock targets cover the elevated demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand data.

Period 26. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (Periods 16-25 avg demand \u2248 305+, prior avg \u224895), and multiple concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3. On-hand=0, in-transit=1316 (ample pipeline covering several periods of elevated demand). I set L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (reflects confirmed LT=3). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 16-25) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of recent samples. I also use recent_N N=10 for sigma_hat to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices align ordering to the confirmed longer lead time and materially higher demand, reducing stockouts while controlling extra holding since in-transit is already large.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: demand has been in the high regime since Period 16 (avg ~305/unit); current on-hand=0, in-transit=1323 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=3 periods (multiple confirmed observations). To match the sustained higher-demand regime and confirmed LT=3, I set lead time explicitly to 3.0 so the OR engine plans over the correct replenishment horizon. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16-26) so mu_hat reflects the higher mean; similarly use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts under much higher demand) versus holding costs by relying on recent high-demand data and confirmed LT rather than long historical low-demand data.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=1323. Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals). Demand regime shifted up at Period_16 (post-Period_16 avg \u2248305); recent periods (16-27) remain in high regime. To account for actual lead time and recent high demand, set L using observed lead times and set demand estimates from recent high-demand regime (capture last 12 periods since changepoint). These parameters steer the OR engine to hold (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while recognizing long lead time and large pipeline to avoid stockouts but limit excess holding given holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=1316. Historical concluded lead times show a dominant 3-period pattern since early periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations) but with some 1-2 period variability; use calculated average lead time to let backend quantify. Demand permanently shifted up at Period 16 (higher regime from Periods 16\u201328); therefore forecast using recent sample window covering this regime (Periods 16\u201328, 13 samples) for both mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated, current demand. This balances higher service-level need (to capture strong demand) against holding cost by letting OR compute z* and cap with the supplied recent-demand statistics. No new sustained lead-time or demand insights to record.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=1325. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained demand regime shift since Period 16 (much higher demand). Large pipeline suggests shipments are en route under the 3-period lead time. I select L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (will confirm 3). I select mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures the sustained higher-demand regime and scales safety stock for the chosen lead time). This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high demand and large in-transit) against holding cost by relying on statistical base-stock computation rather than manually overshooting orders.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: demand has been in a higher regime since Period_16 (avg Periods16-18 \u2248305.3; sustained high demand through Period_30). Lead time historically confirmed as 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1325 (large pipeline). I set L explicit=3 to match observed lead-time confirmations. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods16-30) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 15 samples; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 15 samples via recent_N N=15. This keeps the base-stock anchored to the new higher demand while accounting for the confirmed longer lead time and large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=1325. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (much higher demand since then) and multiple observed lead times clustering at 3 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times to capture the confirmed longer lead-time (vs promised 2). For demand I use a recent_N estimate using the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201331) so mu_hat reflects the higher mean over the last 16 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N over the same 16 samples to capture current volatility. This combination raises the base-stock to cover the higher demand and the longer inferred lead time while sigma from recent data sets safety stock appropriate to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=1325. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=3 (multiple P->P+3 arrivals) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (periods 16-32 demand ~300s). Pipeline (1325) covers ~4+ periods of high demand (~300 each) so risk of short-term overstock is low but service is priority given high profit. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 16\u201332) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Use sigma recent_N N=17 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices align the OR base-stock calculation with the confirmed longer lead time and the sustained higher mean/variance, improving service while controlling holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34. Demand has been in the high regime since Period_16 (Periods 16-33 show sustained elevated demand; prior analysis: avg before P16=95.4, avg P16-18=305.3). On-hand=0, in-transit=1325 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers multiple future periods but arrivals have historically shown actual lead_time=3 repeatedly. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let backend confirm the frequent 3-period realization. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=18 (the post-changepoint regime length from Period_16 through Period_33) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime and avoid understocking. Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures current volatility; these choices prioritize service (higher base stock) given high profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1).

Current on-hand=0 but in-transit=1325 (large pipeline) \u2014 some orders placed earlier concluded with 3-period delays. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period LT). For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 16\u201334) to base mu_hat on the sustained high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 19 samples). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=19 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align safety stock to the new higher-demand level while leveraging observed lead time to avoid underordering given long pipeline.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: on-hand=0, in-transit=1325. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (avg before P16=95.4 vs avg P16-18=305.3). Given confirmed LT=3, I let the backend compute an empirical average (method=calculate) for L so it uses observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (covers the post-changepoint regime from Period 16 to now) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 20 demands, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 20 demands via recent_N N=20. This raises targets to serve the higher-demand regime while the large in-transit position (1325) reduces immediate ordering; these choices prioritize service under confirmed higher demand while the backend cap will limit order sizes to control holding cost.

Treat actual lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering given delayed arrivals. Set L explicit=3. For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent high-demand regime to capture current elevated mean/volatility (N=20, capped). This increases mu_hat and sigma_hat to cover (1+L) periods of demand and improves service while acknowledging holding cost tradeoff.

I set L='calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-time data (letting the empirical average reflect intermittent 1s but many 3s). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 16+; regime length >=20 so N=20 per rules). I apply recent_N also to sigma_hat (N=20) so volatility reflects the recent high-demand period. These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while allowing the backend lead-time average to recognize occasional shorter arrivals.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: demand has been in the high regime (\u2248300s) since Period 16; multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 in prior history. On-hand=0, in-transit=1325 (large pipeline). I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)-period demand on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Period 16+), which captures current elevated mean while limiting older low-demand influence. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices align base-stock to the confirmed longer lead time and current high demand while using recent variability to balance service level vs holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: on-hand=0, large in-transit=1325. Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 with much higher demand. To respect observed lead time and recent high-demand regime I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-shift regime (most recent 20 demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from that recent high-demand window. This increases target base-stock to improve service during the sustained high-demand period while sigma from the same window captures current volatility.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: demand has been in the high regime since Period_16 (~300s). On-hand=0, in-transit=1325 (large pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods repeatedly. I choose L="calculate" so backend uses observed lead-time average (captures confirmed LT=3). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to anchor mu_hat to the most recent high-demand regime (cap N at 20 per rules). Same recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings prioritize service (higher base stock for the sustained high-demand regime and observed longer lead time) while letting the OR cap limit extreme orders and control holding costs given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=1325. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 3 periods (multiple observations P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, etc.), and a sustained demand regime shift occurred at Period_16 (higher mean thereafter). Because the current demand regime is the post-shift high-demand regime, I set L using all observed lead times (calculate) to let the backend confirm the empirical average (which is 3). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-change high-demand behavior (use the most recent 20 concluded demand samples to forecast (1+L)-period demand). For volatility I also use recent_N N=20 to estimate variability from the same recent high-demand regime. This ensures base_stock reflects elevated demand while L reflects observed longer lead-time, and uses recent data to avoid diluting the forecast with low pre-shift demands. I note pipeline (1325) is large relative to recent-period demand \u2014 the OR cap will limit ordering if pipeline already covers (1+L) demand, helping avoid excess holdings.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: demand has been in the higher regime since Period_16 (sustained high demands ~250-370). On-hand=0, in-transit=1325 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers multiple future periods but some past shipments were delayed; observed concluded lead times show predominantly 3 periods. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 3-period behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (use the most recent 20 demand samples from the post-changepoint high-demand regime to forecast (1+L) demand across review+lead period). For volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent regime variance. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the backend cap limits order size to control holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=1325. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple observed: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, etc.). Demand permanently shifted up at Period_16 (pre avg ~95, post much higher) \u2014 recent demand has been in the high regime. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time and avoid underordering. For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime (20 most recent periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and variation, improving service while controlling holding costs given large pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: demand has been in the high regime since Period_16 (periods 16-44 showing ~250-370 demand regularly). On-hand=0, in-transit=1325 (large pipeline likely covering upcoming demand but many past shipments were delayed). Historical concluded lead-times consistently show 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations), so use calculated lead time. To capture the sustained post-Period_16 high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (uses most recent 20 observed demand samples to reflect current mean/volatility over the review+lead period). This balances service (avoid stockouts given confirmed longer lead time and high demand) against holding cost by relying on recent regime stats rather than diluted full-history averages.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to focus on the most recent elevated regime (last 20 periods, Periods26-45) so mu_hat reflects current demand level and (1+L) review+lead coverage. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices align inventory targets with the sustained higher demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost= $1 and profit=$4.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=1325. Historical concludes show consistent 3-period arrivals (multiple P\u2192P+3), and demand has been in the higher regime since Period_16 (~300 units). To reflect confirmed longer lead times use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures the repeated 3-period pattern). For demand forecast use recent data from the post-changepoint high-demand regime: set mu_hat to recent_N with N=20 (use the most recent 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean), and set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices bias stock toward higher service for the sustained high-demand regime while the calculated L accounts for slower/3-period arrivals and reduces risk of stockouts given large in-transit but delayed shipments.

Historical concludes show consistent 3-period actual lead time since early periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals) and a sustained demand regime shift at Period_16 to much higher demand (~305 avg). To reflect confirmed longer lead time, set L via calculate (backend will average observed lead times). For demand, use recent_N with N=20 to capture the high-demand regime (cap at 20 recent periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock covers (1+L) periods of the current high demand while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=1325. Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period arrivals (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, many later confirms) so actual lead time is persistently 3\u2014not the promised 2. Given large in-transit pipeline and confirmed LT=3, I let the backend compute average observed LT (method=calculate) so OR uses empirical LT. For demand forecasting I use backend defaults (mu_hat default and sigma_hat default) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this leverages all historical demand (including the confirmed higher-demand regime from Period 16 onward) while letting the OR engine compute safety stock tradeoff using profit/holding costs. This balances service (respecting the longer LT) against holding cost given the large existing pipeline.

Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=3 for many orders (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, etc.), and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period_16 with much higher demand thereafter. I set L via calculate to let the backend use observed lead times (evidence favors ~3). For demand I use recent_N with N=34 (Periods 16\u201349) to capture the post-shift high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=34 to reflect post-shift volatility. These choices align orders with the confirmed higher-demand regime and the longer observed lead time while avoiding dilution by the low-demand early periods.
