Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show mean ~100.6 with moderate variability. No sustained changepoint or missing-shipment evidence. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes base stock from all historical data and promised L=2.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=147; Period_1 order (147) has not concluded yet (arrived=0) \u2014 single delayed arrival is insufficient to confirm lead-time change. Historical demand samples mean \u2248100.6 units; promised L=2 remains best prior. Use default calculations so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level given profit/holding ratio while avoiding overreaction to one missed arrival.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=289 (orders from P1+P2). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 this is expected (orders placed in P1/P2 would conclude at P3/P4). No evidence of a sustained lead-time shift or demand regime change. Use default lead time to align with promised lead time and let the OR engine compute base_stock from full-sample statistics. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, which balances service vs holding cost given current limited evidence.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical demand samples mean=100.6 (periods 1-5). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have arrived=0 at their conclude messages, indicating probable lead-time > promised 2. To be conservative I set lead time explicitly longer so the OR engine orders for a longer pipeline. Chosen L explicit=3 to reflect delayed arrivals; mu_hat explicit=402.4 ((1+3)*mean(100.6)) to cover review+lead demand under L=3; sigma_hat default so backend computes volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level given suspected delays while avoiding an overly large sigma estimate that would inflate safety stock further.

Carry-over insight: Possible lead-time increase: orders placed in Periods 1-3 show arrived=0 at conclude (3 consecutive periods), suggesting actual lead time >2 or lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1856.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: on-hand=120, in-transit=248, recent demand samples mean=100.6 (Periods 1-5). Period_4 conclude shows arrivals from Period_1 (147 units, lead_time=3) and Period_3 (77 units, lead_time=1) indicating variable lead times and at least one arrival with lead_time>promised(2). Several early orders had arrived=0 at prior concludes, so I use observed lead-time data to set L via calculation (average observed lead times) to let the OR backend adapt to actual shipment delays. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to rely on full-sample demand estimates given limited regime-change evidence; this balances service level (captures longer lead time) against holding cost using backend's base-stock formula.

Carry-over insight: Lead time observed as 3 periods for order placed in Period 1 (arrived Period 4); evidence of variable/occasionally longer-than-promised lead times

Daily Reward (R_t): $1680.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start: on-hand=30, in-transit=348. Historical concluded lead times: observed 3 (P1\u2192P4) and 1 (P3\u2192P4) \u2014 average = 2. Demand history mean \u2248100.6 units. I set L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures occasional 3-period events while weighting shorter arrivals). I set mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that accounts for the inferred average lead time and the full sample demand variability. This leverages the large in-transit volume while keeping safety stock responsive to observed lead-time variability to trade off service vs holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $570.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: on-hand=0, in-transit=431, recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W=3 for P1\u2192P4 and W=1 for P3\u2192P4). Pipeline is large but arrivals have been irregular; to capture recent variation in lead time I use recent_N for L (last 2 observed lead times). Demand history available; no clear sustained demand regime shift, so use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend adjusts order-up-to appropriately. This balances service (accounting for longer occasional lead time) versus holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: on-hand=35, in-transit=371. Historical concluded lead times: 3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P4->P7) \u2014 variable but skewed to 3. Demand samples mean=100.6 (samples: 88,148,80,84,103). I choose L=calculate to let backend use the observed average lead time (captures observed variability > promised 2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative replenishment target given large in-transit and variable lead times.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1959.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show variable but frequently 3-period lead times (observed lead_times sequence: 3,1,3,3,1). To capture this shift away from the promised 2, I set L using recent_N to average the last 5 observed lead times. Demand has been mixed but the last 5 demand samples (Periods 4-8) give a stable short-run mean, so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime. Volatility appears typical \u2014 use default sigma_hat to let backend scale std over (1+L). These choices hedge service level upward to cover occasional 3-period arrivals while avoiding excessive holding cost by using a recent demand mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2082.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand=27, in-transit=333. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed lead_times = 3,1,3,3,1 across concluded orders), with several 3-period arrivals and some 1-periods and prior delayed/no-arrival episodes. To be conservative about delayed shipments I let the backend infer lead time from observed data (calculate). Demand shows no clear sustained upward regime requiring an adjusted forecast, so I use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost given the inferred L and known profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time frequently equals 3 periods: observed concluded arrivals \u2014 ordered P1 arrived P4 (3), ordered P4 arrived P7 (3), ordered P5 arrived P8 (3); other observed lead_times: 1,1. Evidence supports treating lead time as variable with repeated 3-period occurrences.

Daily Reward (R_t): $513.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=425. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) mean=100.6; recent concluded lead-time observations show a mix of 1s and 3s with several 3-period occurrences. Average of the last 3 observed lead times = 2.333, indicating lead time is frequently longer than promised 2. To protect service with limited visible inventory, I set L using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the recent skew to 3-period lead times. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L); this balances higher safety stock from longer L against holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times with frequent 3-period occurrences but overall recent average \u22482; demand has been ~100\u2013131 recent periods. To be cautious about variable lead times while not overreacting to intermittent 3s, I use a recent-N estimate for L (N=5) to capture the latest lead-time pattern. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a balanced forecast and volatility for the base-stock calculation given the chosen L.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 13: on-hand=88, in-transit=225. Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (orders P1->P4, P4->P7, P5->P8, P9->P12) indicating actual lead time frequently =3. To protect service level given delayed arrivals I set L explicit=3. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) so mu_hat reflects current demand patterns. Volatility will use default to let the backend scale std over (1+L). These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts given variable/extended lead times while controlling holding cost via the OR engine's capped policy.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=370. Historical demand samples mean=100.6 (periods 1-5). Concluded arrivals repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirmed P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8). Given frequent 3-period realizations and recent missing/delayed arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3 to ensure pipeline covers (L+1) periods. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, yielding a conservative replenishment target that balances service (captures longer lead time) against holding cost.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Recent history shows variable lead times with multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals (P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12) plus occasional 1\u20132 period arrivals; on-hand=0, in-transit=479. To account for this variability I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). I use default demand/volatility aggregation so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level (captures longer observed lead times) against holding cost while letting the OR engine apply its capped ordering rule given the promised lead time and historical demands.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 16, on-hand=0, in-transit=479. Historical concluded lead-times (observed): [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2] \u2014 frequent 3-periods but mixed with 1s/2s. I choose L as recent_N (N=8) to average all 8 observed lead times to capture the variable but slightly >2 pattern. Demand has shown no abrupt regime shift; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 demand observations (Periods 11-15) to reflect the most recent demand level while scaling for the chosen lead+review period. This balances service (accounting for occasionally longer lead times) against holding cost by modestly increasing pipeline coverage without overinflating volatility estimates.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Recent history shows repeated 3-period arrivals (orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16) indicating actual lead time often = 3. On-hand=0, in-transit=334 (large pipeline). To protect service while acknowledging longer lead times and holding cost, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, giving a multi-period demand cover consistent with observed ~100/unit mean and reducing stockout risk given variable lead times.

Carry-over insight: Lead time frequently equals 3 periods: confirmed by arrivals ordered P9\u2192arrived P12 and P13\u2192arrived P16 (multiple 3-period occurrences after Period 10).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=409. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple consistent 3-period lead times (orders P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17), so treat lead time as 3 to capture frequent longer arrivals and avoid stockouts. No robust multi-period demand regime shift is confirmed (recent spikes at P16\u2013P17 are not yet 3+ periods), so use default demand estimates based on all samples; default volatility likewise. These choices bias orders upward to cover (1+L) periods of demand given variable/occasionally longer lead times, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: recent demand has spiked (Periods 16-18: 280, 289, 280) and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=623. Historical concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead times (many orders placed arrived after 3 periods) though some 1-2 period events exist; average observed lead time \u22482.3. To account for variable/often-longer lead times while letting the OR engine compute demand pooling over the review+lead window, I select L via 'calculate' (average observed lead times). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances using full historical demand data while the calculated L inflates the review+lead horizon to protect service during repeat 3-period delays. This approach recognizes overdue/delayed shipments (large in-transit) and raises the effective coverage without overfitting short-term spikes.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=672. Historical concluded lead times are variable with many 3-period occurrences (recent observed LT samples = [3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,3], avg\u22482.3). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 16 (demands: P16=280, P17=289, P18=280, P19=264). To handle variable/occasionally longer lead times I set L to the recent average of observed lead times. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (the new regime length) so the OR engine targets higher base stock while acknowledging increased variability.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=968. Recent concluded arrivals show lead times frequently equal 3 periods (multiple ordered\u2192arrived pairs with W=3). Demand has shifted sharply since Period 16 (sustained high demands in Periods 16-20). To protect service during this higher-demand regime while accounting for longer/variable lead times, I set lead time using recent observed lead-times, and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand periods to capture the new high mean and volatility. This increases target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand level and increases safety stock to mitigate delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand P1-15 = 106.6 vs avg demand P16-20 = 287 (+169%, sustained 5 periods); Lead time frequently equals 3 periods (multiple observed W=3 in recent concludes: ordered P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=0, in-transit=1154. Recent concludes show frequent lead_time=3 and a sustained demand regime shift since Period 16 (avg demand P16-21 \u2248273). Promised L=2 is frequently violated; set L=3 (explicit) to reflect observed arrivals. Forecast demand per review+lead period: (1+L)*mean_recent = 4*273 = 1092 \u2192 mu_hat explicit=1092. Volatility: recent std \u224839.3 scaled by sqrt(1+L)=2 \u2192 sigma_hat \u224879 (explicit) to capture observed variability. These parameters align pipeline target with higher sustained demand and the longer observed lead time, reducing stockouts while controlling holding cost given high profit margin.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 23. On-hand=0, in-transit=1222. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent lead_time=3 (many orders: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (avg demand P1-15 \u2248106.6 vs P16-20 \u2248287). Given repeated 3-period arrivals and the sustained higher demand, I set lead time L=3 to reflect observed reality. Forecast per-period demand in the high regime \u2248287; with review+lead=(1+L)=4 this yields mu_hat \u22484*287=1148 to target service under higher demand. In-transit (1222) roughly matches this pipeline forecast, reducing risk of immediate stockouts. I set sigma_hat=80 (explicit) to reflect elevated volatility under the new regime (sqrt(1+L)=2 implies an underlying per-period std \u224840). These choices shift the OR backend's base-stock upward to prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while recognizing holding cost is low relative to profit (profit=19, holding=1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand P1-15 = 106.6 vs avg demand P16-20 = 287 (+169%); Lead time frequently equals 3 periods (observed concluded arrivals: P1\u2192P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17).

LLM Rationale:

Demand regime shift at Period 16 to a higher mean is already established in history. To account for variable/occasionally longer-than-promised lead times while letting the OR engine compute forecast scaling consistently with historical samples, I set L to the calculated average lead time and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (captures longer effective lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25: on-hand=0, in-transit=730. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (higher demand) and mixed but frequently 3-period lead times. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (captures variability around promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (periods 16\u201324 constitute a sustained higher-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent mean across the review+lead window. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 to capture recent volatility under the new demand regime. These choices bias orders toward meeting higher recent demand while letting the backend incorporate the inferred lead time variability.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=1022. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift up since Period 16 (higher mean ~280\u2013375 recent) and frequent lead_time=3 observations but with variability (1\u20133). I set L to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent mix of observed lead times (multiple 3s but some 1\u20132s). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (last 5 demands are elevated). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect volatility in the recent high-demand periods. These choices bias the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts under the new higher-demand regime while capturing recent lead-time variability; large in-transit balance will be considered by the OR engine when computing order quantities.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: on-hand=0, in-transit=1258. Historical concludes show lead times frequently = 3 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 16 (recent demands much higher). To respect repeated 3-period arrivals while letting OR engine compute with recent high-demand samples, I set lead time using recent observed lead times (recent_N) and set demand forecast and volatility using recent demand (recent_N) from the high-demand regime (last 5 periods). This keeps the backend\u2019s base-stock tuned to the elevated demand while acknowledging variable/longer lead times reflected in recent concludes.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. On-hand=0, in-transit=1258. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period lead-times mixed with 1\u20132; average of observed lead times is >2, so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer actual central tendency. Demand clearly shifted up at Period 16 (sustained higher demand through Period 27); use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 16\u201327) to capture the new high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the higher demand while using observed lead-time average to accommodate variable/occasionally longer arrivals and avoid stockouts given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16 (sustained elevated demand ~280-330). On-hand=0, in-transit=1022 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show variable lead times with many 3-period occurrences; to be conservative I let the backend infer average lead time from observed concludes. I choose calculate for L so backend uses observed lead-time history; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This leverages the large in-transit stock while letting OR engine balance service level vs holding cost based on estimated average lead time and full-sample demand statistics.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=1022. Historical concludes show a sustained, higher-demand regime since Period 16 (recent avg ~291.6 vs earlier avg 106.6) and multiple confirmed lead_time=3 observations. Because demand regime change is sustained, I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the recent high-demand regime (use recent_N over that regime). For lead time, recent concluded arrivals frequently show 3-period lead times, so I use a recent_N estimate to capture variability toward 3. Choosing larger N for demand (N=14 covering Periods 16\u201329) captures the new regime; choosing N=6 for lead time focuses on the most recent lead-time behavior. These settings steer the OR backend to raise the base-stock (service level) appropriate for the much higher demand while accounting for the observed longer/variable lead time; this balances lost-sales profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) given the large in-transit position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand P1-15 = 106.6 vs avg demand P16-29 = 291.6 (+173%, sustained); Lead time frequently equals 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show W=3 across recent periods).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=1204. Historical concludes show frequent lead_time=3 (many orders with W=3) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (higher mean \u2248291 from P16\u2013P30). To account for repeated 3-period arrivals and avoid stockouts, set L explicitly to 3. To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201330, N=15). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N=15 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the higher, sustained demand and align pipeline coverage with the observed longer lead time, mitigating lost/delayed shipment risk while balancing holding cost.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: demand has been in the higher regime since Period 16 (sustained ~280\u2013330 range). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time frequently = 3 (many orders with W=3). On-hand is 0 and in-transit=1297 (significant pipeline). To reflect observed lead-time behavior I set L explicit=3. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201331, 16 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean/volatility rather than older low-demand data. These parameters let the OR backend size base-stock to meet (1+L) periods of high demand while accounting for observed longer lead time and the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift since Period 16 (post-shift avg \u2248 291.6 units/period) and repeated concluded lead times of 3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1207. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed frequent 3-period arrivals (avoids under-ordering). I set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*post-shift mean = 4 * 291.6 = 1166.4 to cover the review+lead demand under the new regime. I leave sigma_hat as default so the backend computes volatility from samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize service (given high profit vs low holding cost) while relying on backend volatility calc for safety stock sizing.

To ensure pipeline covers the higher sustained demand and the empirically frequent 3-period lead time, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use recent_N over the post-shift regime (Periods 16\u219233, regime_length=18) so mu_hat reflects elevated mean; use the same recent_N window for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock target to the true higher demand and longer lead time, reducing stockouts despite holding cost.

Lead-time history shows many 3-period arrivals (repeated across history) so I use the calculated average lead time from observed concludes to capture variable/occasionally longer LT. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-changepoint window (periods since P16) to reflect the sustained higher demand; same recent window for volatility. These choices push the backend to target a larger (1+L)-period demand estimate while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding given large in-transit inventory.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=1501. Historical concluded arrivals show frequent 3-period lead times (many P\u2192P+3 observations) and a sustained demand regime shift at Period_16 (higher mean ~291). Pipeline (1501) is large versus one-period demand but arrivals' timing is variable; some shipments have arrived with W=1,2,3. I choose L.method='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (uses concluded history) to reflect the variable but frequently-3 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (the sustained high-demand regime runs from Period_16 to Period_35, 20 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 20 demands) capturing the new higher demand level. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the recent high-demand regime. These choices align ordering to recent high demand while letting the backend compute safety stock using the inferred average lead time and recent demand stats; large in-transit stock reduces immediate order needs but variable lead time advises keeping safety buffer.

These choices align the base-stock target to the higher sustained demand and the empirically supported longer lead time, while relying on the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering.

On-hand=0, in-transit=1501 (large pipeline). I set L explicit=3 to reflect the repeatedly observed 3-period lead time (promised=2 is repeatedly violated). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (uses last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices align the OR base-stock calculation to the higher, persistent demand and the empirically longer lead time while the large in-transit volume will moderate immediate ordering.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 39. History shows a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 16 (higher mean ~291+) and multiple confirmed 3-period lead times across concludes. On-hand=0, in-transit=1501 (large pipeline). To reflect persistent longer lead time, set L explicit=3. To capture post-changepoint demand/volatility, use recent_N over the regime (Periods 16\u201338, N=23) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend base-stock and cap reflect the higher mean and observed variability while the large in-transit volume will be reconciled by the OR engine.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 40. On-hand=0, In-transit=1501. History shows multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=3 (e.g., ordered P1\u2192arrived P4, P4\u2192P7, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17), indicating actual lead time frequently equals 3 rather than the promised 2. To account for the sustained longer lead time and avoid stockouts given high recent demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. Use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend applies the full historical demand pool while incorporating the longer lead time into the review+lead period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period lead times (multiple confirmed W=3 events since Period 10) so I set L explicit=3 to reflect actual supply reality. Demand jumped at Period 16 and has remained high through Period 40; to capture the new regime I use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covers Periods 21\u201340 roughly, capped at 20) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility reflecting the sustained higher demand. This balances service (higher base stock for elevated demand and longer lead time) against holding cost by using recent samples rather than all historic low-demand periods. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=1501 will be compared by the OR engine against the computed base stock when placing orders.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=1501. History shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period_16 (avg \u2248291) and frequent actual lead_time=3 in concluded arrivals. I will set L using recent lead-time observations to capture variability above the promised 2. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with a large N to focus the forecast on the post-Period_16 high-demand regime (use max recent window capped at 20). These choices make the OR backend target replenishment sized for the higher recent demand and account for currently-observed longer lead times, reducing stockouts while controlling holdings given holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=1501. History of concluded arrivals shows frequent 3-period lead times since Period 10 with multiple confirmations; demand regime shifted up at Period 16 and has remained elevated. To cover the (L+1) review+lead horizon under the higher-demand regime and account for observed W=3 arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand forecast, use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Period 16 onward) while limiting noise from older low-demand history. Use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but variable arrivals) while letting the backend compute safety stock from empirical recent demand and the declared L=3.

LLM Rationale:
Period_44: On-hand=0, in-transit=1501. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_16 (high demand ~280\u2013388) and frequent actual lead time = 3. To match the higher recent demand and observed longer lead times, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 periods (captures the post-changepoint high-demand regime) so the OR backend increases base stock while reflecting recent variability; this also leverages the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 45: demand has been in the high regime since Period 16 (sustained ~280\u2013388). On-hand=0, in-transit=1501 (covers multiple future periods). Historical concludes show frequent actual lead_time=3 (many P\u2192P+3 observations). I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed frequent 3-period lead time (promised=2 but arrivals consistently show W=3). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Period16+), so mu_hat and sigma_hat are based on the last 20 demand samples (captures recent mean/volatility). This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given longer lead time) vs holding cost by using recent demand evidence rather than entire historical low-demand periods.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=1501. History shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (much higher demand ~~290 vs ~106 earlier) and repeated observed lead times of 3 periods across many concluded arrivals. Many recent arrivals show W=3, so using a 3-period lead time reduces stockouts given long/variable arrivals. I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean demand (choose N=20 to cover the most recent sustained high-demand periods). Similarly use recent_N N=20 for sigma to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher \u03bc\u0302 to meet elevated demand) while sigm\xe2 from recent data informs safety stock; given large in-transit (1501) the backend cap will limit orders if pipeline suffices.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg P1-15 = 106.6 vs avg recent \u2248 291.6 (+~173%), sustained across many periods; Lead time frequently equals 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show W=3 across recent history).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 47. Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime since Period 16 (avg demand ~291 vs ~107 before) and historical concludes repeatedly show lead time = 3 periods. There is 0 on-hand and 1501 in-transit. To protect service given observed 3-period arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand forecast and volatility, use recent data from the sustained high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent 20 periods of the high-demand regime (balances responsiveness and sample size). These parameters increase target base-stock to meet elevated demand while accounting for observed longer lead times and controlling holding cost via recent-sample volatility.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=1501. Historical concluded arrivals show a persistent, frequent 3-period lead time and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (recent avg \u2248291.6). To ensure pipeline covers the longer lead time and elevated demand, I set L explicit=3. I provide an explicit mu_hat equal to (1+L)*recent_avg_demand \u2248 4*291.6 = 1166.4 to size the base stock to current high-demand regime. Because demand variability is elevated, I set sigma_hat explicit=200 to give the OR engine a conservative volatility input and avoid stockouts given observed variability and variable lead times. These settings prioritize service (reduce lost sales) while accepting some holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=1501. Demand shifted up at Period_16 and has remained elevated (recent averages ~290s); lead times show variability with many 3-period occurrences but overall observed-average \u22482.18. To respect the sustained higher-demand regime, forecast demand using the most recent data window while letting the backend compute an empiric average lead time from concluded arrivals. Methods: L set to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to protect service given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while relying on observed lead-time average to reflect occasional 3-period delays.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_50: recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period_16 (~\u2248290 avg) versus ~106 earlier. On-hand=0, in-transit=1501 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers multiple periods. Historical concludes show frequent actual lead_time=3 (multiple confirmed W=3), so I set L=3 to reflect reality rather than promised 2. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (post-changepoint Period_16) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 20 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect volatility in the same window. These choices align purchases with the higher sustained demand and longer observed lead time, while letting the OR backend cap orders to avoid excess holding given the large in-transit stock.
