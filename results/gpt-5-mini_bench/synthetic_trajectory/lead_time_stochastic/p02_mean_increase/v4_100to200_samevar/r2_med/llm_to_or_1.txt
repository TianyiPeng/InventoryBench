  Mean: 91.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 2 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time. Historical samples (105,36,108,110,96) give mean=91 units/period. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This is conservative given no evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change; it balances service (using full-sample forecast) against holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_2. Demand context: recent historical samples mean=91 units/period (samples: 105,36,108,110,96). On-hand=0, in-transit=143 (ordered P1, arrival not yet observed). Cannot confirm actual lead time from concluded history (no arrivals observed), so retain promised lead time. Using default lead time keeps L=promised(2). Default mu_hat and sigma_hat use all samples: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all = 3\xd791 (backend will compute) which highlights current pipeline (143) under-covers the target pipeline (~273), so ordering will top up toward the base-stock. No evidence of sustained demand or lead-time regime change yet.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: on-hand=0, in-transit=279 (orders from P1+P2), no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unconfirmed despite apparent delays. Historical demand samples available (Period_1..5). I retain promised lead time and use default demand estimates so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service vs holding cost while we wait for conclusive arrival evidence. Will revisit if a conclude message confirms prolonged delays or lead-time change.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=327 (orders from P1:143, P2:136, P3:48). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5): [105,36,108,110,96] -> mean=91. Promised lead time=2 but no concluded arrivals for orders placed in P1\u2013P3; however, per rules we may only confirm lead-time changes from conclude messages, and we have no positive arrivals to compute a new average. To be conservative and compatible with the OR engine, I keep L=default (use promised lead time). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full-sample statistics while the OR engine's capped order will limit ordering given pipeline. This balances service level (using full-sample demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and uncertain arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed P1 (143), P2 (136), P3 (48) have not concluded (arrived=0 in Periods 1\u20133 conclude); in-transit shows 327 units \u2014 suggests actual lead time >2 or delayed/lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $344.00, Daily Holding Cost: $105.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $239.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (P1\u2192P4: lead_time=3; P3\u2192P4: lead_time=1). On-hand=105, in-transit=138. Historical demand mean=(105+36+108+110+96)/5=91; recent demand stable but earlier periods had unmet demand due to delayed arrivals. I set L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed 3-period delay vs promised 2). mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' use (1+L)-scaled historical mean and volatility so orders cover review+lead demand without overreacting to single spikes. This balances service level (accounts for longer observed lead time) against holding cost given moderate holding penalty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order placed P1 arrived P4); earlier shipments showed delays/loss risk (orders P1\u2013P3 had delayed arrivals).

Daily Profit: $220.00, Daily Holding Cost: $50.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $170.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6: on-hand=50, in-transit=276. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 3 (order P1->arrived P4) and 1 (order P3->arrived P4); average observed lead time = 2. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times. Demand history mean=91 (samples P1\u2013P5); with L\u22482 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods, so default mu_hat=(1+L)*mean -> targets ~273, and default sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. Current on-hand+in-transit (~326) covers ~3 periods of average demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and hold=1. Note: order from P2 remains unconcluded (possible delay/loss) but evidence not yet strong enough to override calculation method.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=361; recent concluded arrivals show an actual lead time longer than promised (P1\u2192P4 => lead_time=3) and uneven past arrivals. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed 3-period lead time so the OR engine forecasts pipeline appropriately. Demand has increased in the most recent periods (last 3 sample mean > full-sample mean), so I use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat to capture the higher recent demand over the review+lead window. I keep sigma_hat as default (uses all samples) to provide a stable volatility estimate. This combination raises the base stock to cover the longer confirmed lead time and recent uplift in demand while retaining conservative variability for safety.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=385. Historical concludes show mixed lead-times but multiple confirmed 3-period lead times (P1->P4, P4->P7) and earlier delayed/lost arrivals; demand samples available. To capture the apparent longer actual lead time, let backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with the inferred lead time; this balances higher safety stock for longer/more uncertain replenishment while avoiding explicit risky overrides.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=108, in-transit=259. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 3 (order P1 arrived P4) and multiple delayed arrivals earlier, so use explicit L=3. Demand recent 5-periods (P4\u2013P8 = 86,55,115,110,56) captures current regime; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 so (1+L) coverage reflects 4-period demand and recent volatility. This increases pipeline coverage to mitigate lost/delayed shipments while balancing holding cost.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W = 3,1,3,1,1 \u2192 avg \u22481.8). On-hand=42, in-transit=240. To capture the observed lead-time drift while letting the OR engine compute demand across the review+lead period, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and left mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses all demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L). This balances higher effective lead time risk (use avg observed L) with no aggressive manual up/down adjustment to demand or volatility given mixed recent demand signals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: on-hand=0, in-transit=357. Historical concluded lead times observed = {3,1,3,3,1,1} (avg=2). Demand history shows variable demand with recent stockouts; shipments have sometimes been delayed or arrived with L=3 but also L=1. To avoid overreacting to mixed signals, set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level and holding cost given in-transit exposure and demand variability.

LLM Rationale:

To hedge delayed/lost shipments while avoiding excessive holding cost, set lead-time estimate using recent_N (N=3) to weight the most recent evidence of multi-period delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable demand forecast while the L estimate captures recent lead-time shifts and increases pipeline coverage for the current decision.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=18, in-transit=247. Historical concluded lead times show variability (sequence of observed lead times: 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2); recent window averages ~2. Recent demand (Periods 8\u201312): [56,104,60,104,118], mean=88.4. To balance service vs holding cost given mixed but recently lower lead times, I set L using a recent average, and use recent demand statistics (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine adapts to the latest regime while accounting for pipeline inventory and potential delayed arrivals.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=0, in-transit=346; history shows multiple concluded lead times (observed sequence 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2) indicating average lead time > promised 2 and some shipments delayed. I set L=calculate to let the backend use the average observed lead time (captures recent mixed but elevated delays). Demand estimates use default (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default sigma (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to keep forecasts stable given limited data and avoid overreacting to noisy short-term swings. This balances service level (accounting for longer effective lead time) against holding cost by increasing the review+lead forecast only as much as the observed average lead time implies.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=354. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W = 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3; avg \u2248 2.22) with multiple recent 3-period arrivals, indicating actual lead time > promised 2. To reflect observed lead-time drift while letting the OR engine recompute demand over the review+lead horizon, set L by 'calculate' (uses average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service (captures longer lead time) without overfitting short-term noise given moderate demand variability.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 16, on-hand=0, in-transit=385. Historical concluded lead times show frequent 3-period arrivals (several orders) with occasional 1\u20132 period cases; average of observed lead times ~2.22. To account for the empirically longer lead time vs promised and maintain service while limiting holding cost, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses the average. Use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base stock and cap with the adjusted L and historical demand samples.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=289, recent concludes show multiple 3-period arrivals (P4,P7,P8,P12,P14,P16) indicating actual lead time ~=3 and repeated delays/loss risk. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed 3-period lead time so the OR engine plans across a longer pipeline. Demand history mean=91 (samples: 105,36,108,110,96); using mu_hat default applies (1+L)*mean to cover review+lead demand. sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)*std to scale variability appropriately. These choices increase coverage for the observed longer lead time while letting the backend compute the safety-stock tradeoff using profit/holding cost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Recent concluded arrivals show repeated 3-period deliveries (several orders with lead_time=3) though shorter arrivals occurred earlier; use calculated average lead time from observed lead times to reflect that evidence. On-hand=0 and in-transit=416 \u2014 pipeline inventory is large, so keep demand forecast and volatility based on full-sample defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine cap orders and avoid overstock given holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: on-hand=0, in-transit=474. Historical concludes show frequent 3-period actual lead times (many arrivals with lead_time=3) and intermittent 1-2 period arrivals; multiple earlier missing/delayed shipments noted. Recent demand (Periods 16-18 = 229, 243, 187) is substantially above earlier history (Period 1-15 avg \u224896), indicating a sustained upward regime starting Period 16. To handle longer/more-variable lead times, set L via calculate (use observed lead times average). To reflect the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (Periods 16-18) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of recent high demands and volatility from those periods. This increases base stock to protect service level amid longer lead times and higher demand while sigma from recent data prevents underestimating variability. The chosen approach also avoids overreacting to older low-demand periods and accounts for past missing shipments by using observed lead-time average rather than promised default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand Periods 16-18 = 219.7 vs prior avg Periods 1-15 = 96 (+129%); actual lead time repeatedly observed as 3 periods in multiple concludes (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=742. Historical concludes show sustained lead_time=3 in many arrivals since Period 4 (multiple P\u2192P+3 confirms) though some 1\u20132 period arrivals occurred. Demand regime shifted up at Period 16 (recent mean ~195/unit over P15\u2013P19). Therefore: set L via recent_N to bias toward the recent confirmed 3-period behavior while still averaging recent observations; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (uses last 5 periods P15\u2013P19); set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased volatility in the recent high-demand regime. These parameters push the OR engine to raise base stock for higher service during the sustained higher-demand regime while accounting for longer observed lead times and elevated variability to reduce stockouts despite holding cost.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=785. Demand has shifted up since Period 16 (sustained high demands ~229,243,187,205,194). Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (orders P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17). To protect service while avoiding excessive holding cost, set lead time explicitly to 3 to match observed reality. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (last 5 periods: P16\u2013P20) so the OR engine sizes base stock and safety stock to current demand volatility.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=887 and multiple concludes confirm actual lead time=3 (repeated P\u2192P+3 arrivals). Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time and avoid underordering. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=6) covering the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 16-21) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of those 6 periods. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. This balances service (capture elevated demand) versus holding cost by basing targets on the new regime and correct lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period 23: recent demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 16 (many periods with demand ~170\u2013243). On-hand=0, in-transit=887 \u2014 multiple concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 3 in history (delayed arrivals and past missing shipments). I set L to be inferred from observed concludes so backend uses measured lead time (method=calculate). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 16\u201322) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility I also use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent variability. These choices make the OR engine target a higher base stock appropriate for the confirmed higher-demand regime and longer observed lead time while using recent samples to avoid being biased by older low-demand periods; this helps balance service (profit $4) vs holding cost $1 given the delayed shipments history.

Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 observations) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (avg \u2248220). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time (promised=2 is outdated). To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 16\u201323) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts across the review+lead horizon using the current elevated mean and volatility. These parameters prioritize service (reduce stockouts) given long lead time and high demand while the OR backend's capped order prevents extreme orders and balances holding cost.

Use recent_N (N=9, Periods 16\u201324) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecasts on the post-shift high-demand regime so the OR engine sizes base stock for (1+L) periods of the new demand level, improving service while avoiding excess holding from older low-demand data.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical concludes show actual lead time=3 periods repeatedly since early periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (high demand ~220). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time (avoids underordering due to promised L=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (periods 16\u201325) so mu_hat reflects the new high-demand regime over the review+lead horizon (1+L periods). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10 to capture volatility in the high-demand regime. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service level given long lead times and high demand while the capped order will limit excess inventory and holding cost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16 (~220 avg) vs ~96 before. On-hand=0, in-transit=872 (large pipeline) and multiple concluded orders show actual lead_time=3 repeatedly. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 16\u201326 regime length) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 11 samples, capturing the sustained higher demand. For volatility I use recent_N N=11 to reflect recent variability. These choices align pipeline coverage with the observed 3-period lead time and the post-Period-16 demand regime, trading higher service level for holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 28. On-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical concludes repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17, P20\u2192P23), so set L explicit=3 to reflect realized arrivals. Demand shifted up starting Period 16 and high demand persists through Period 27; to capture the new regime use recent data. Choose mu_hat recent_N with N=12 (Periods 16\u201327) to forecast (1+L)-period demand under the elevated regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture current volatility. This balances service level (covering multi-period high demand with L=3) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 29: on-hand=0, in-transit=872. Multiple concluded arrivals establish actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 16. To cover review+lead demand while avoiding excessive holding cost, set L explicitly to 3 (matches observed arrivals). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (most recent 5 demand observations: Periods 24-28) so the base_stock and caps reflect present demand level and volatility rather than older low-demand data.

To avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals, I set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-shift regime (Periods 16\u201329, N=14) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent high-demand samples. I also set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to cover the longer observed lead time and higher recent demand while keeping variability estimates tied to the new regime.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=872; historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 periods repeatedly since early periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (avg Periods 16-30 \u2248 219 vs earlier \u224896). To reflect confirmed LT=3 I set L explicitly to 3. For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 16\u201330, length 15) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect higher mean and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 15 samples). This raises target base-stock to protect service during the longer, confirmed lead time while accounting for higher holding cost by using regime-specific moments.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16 (avg ~220) and multiple concluded shipments confirming actual lead time = 3 (orders consistently arriving after 3 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=872 (coverage exists but arrivals will be observed with one-period delay). To account for confirmed longer lead time and the sustained higher-demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast and volatility use recent data from the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201331) to capture the new mean/variance: use recent_N with N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices align OR base-stock toward serving the higher demand while recognizing delayed arrivals and reducing stockout risk despite holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=872. History shows repeated actual lead times \u22483 (many concluded orders with W=3) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 (already noted). To reflect observed lead-time shifts, set L using calculate (backend will average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, allowing the OR engine to incorporate the full demand history and the inferred L when sizing orders. This balances service (capture higher recent demand via updated L) against holding costs given large in-transit stock.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: demand has been in the high regime since Period_16 (~200+ per period). Multiple concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (e.g., P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17 and later patterns), while promised lead time is 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=872 (large pipeline) so pipeline coverage is substantial but actual arrivals occur with L=3. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering due to systematic 1-period longer transit. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=18 (Periods 16\u201333 regime length = 18) so mu_hat reflects the elevated regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 18 samples). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=18 to capture volatility in the current high-demand regime. These choices prioritize service by matching actual lead time and recent high demand while the OR backend will cap orders using pipeline; this balances service-level needs versus holding cost given sizeable in-transit inventory.

Demand regime shifted up at Period 16 and has persisted (higher demands since P16). To reflect confirmed LT=3 I set L explicit=3. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N with N=19 (covers Periods 16\u201334) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock and caps to the current higher mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts under LT=3) against holding cost by using recent regime statistics rather than the low pre-shift samples.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 16 (sustained ~170\u2013260). On-hand=0, in-transit=879 \u2014 substantial pipeline but many prior delayed arrivals; recent concludes repeatedly show lead_time=3. I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers observed average lead time from concluded history (captures the confirmed 3-period behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the 20-period high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201335) so forecasts reflect the sustained demand increase. I use recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service for the new higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using recent mean/variance and observed lead time; they also account for the large in-transit volume when computing ordering needs.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 37. On-hand=0, in-transit=872 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show mixed lead times but many multi-period delays; average of observed lead times is >2 so I let backend compute the empirical average (calculate). Demand permanently shifted up around Period 16 (higher mean since P16); to capture the new regime I use recent_N=20 for demand forecast (captures the most recent ~20 periods including the high-demand regime). I also use recent_N=20 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand while using the calculated L to account for delivery delays and avoid under-ordering given the large in-transit but uncertain arrivals.

To reflect confirmed longer lead time and the high-demand regime I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent high-demand regime length, capped at 20) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 samples.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: on-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical concludes repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 (multiple P\u2192P+3 confirms) and a sustained demand regime increase from Period 16 onward. To reflect confirmed 3-period lead time I set L explicit=3. To capture the high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility are driven by the most recent 20 demand observations (covers Periods 19\u201338 and recent high demand). This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while keeping variability estimate responsive; using recent data also helps the OR engine avoid under-ordering given past delayed arrivals and large in-transit volume.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (higher baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=872 (pipeline large but arrival confirmations lag due to LT=3). To protect service under confirmed LT=3 and the higher-demand regime, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast/volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (20 is chosen per rule: regime length capped at 20). These parameters prioritize meeting elevated demand while letting the OR backend trade off service vs. holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: On-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical concludes repeatedly show actual lead time \u22483 (multiple orders observed arriving 3 periods after order). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_16 (sustained elevated demand). To protect service given confirmed longer lead time, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N for demand and volatility to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (capture latest 25 periods to balance recency and sample size). These parameters increase the base-stock to cover the longer lead time and higher recent demand, trading higher holding for improved fill rates given frequent stockouts when understating demand/lead time.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical concludes show actual lead time=3 periods repeatedly since early history; demand shifted up sharply at Period_16 and has remained high. To reflect observed lead time delays and the sustained high-demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use recent_N on the most recent regime (use N=20 to capture recent high-demand behavior across Periods 22\u201341). Use same recent_N window for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine plans for the longer real lead time and sizes base stock to cover the sustained high-demand regime while letting the backend cap limit extreme over-ordering.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical concludes repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (avg ~220). To cover review+lead demand under the high-demand regime, set L explicit=3. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (cap N at 20 per rules). This prioritizes service for the higher mean demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock tradeoffs given profit/holding costs.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

To account for the confirmed longer lead time and avoid stockouts while letting the OR engine use full historical demand stats, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (with L=3) against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical concludes show a sustained regime shift to high demand starting Period 16 (~220 avg) and multiple confirms of actual lead time \u22483. To account for the observed longer lead time I use calculated lead time (lets backend infer from concluded history). Demand forecast uses the most recent high-demand regime (recent_N with N=20) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and captures current elevated demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This combination increases target base-stock to meet high demand under longer realized lead time while keeping variance estimate tied to recent data to avoid excessive safety stock. Carry-over insights note already captured sustained shifts; no new significant pattern this period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical concludes repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods and sustained higher-demand regime since Period_16 (~+129% vs earlier). Many recent periods (P41\u2013P45) show demand around ~190\u2013221. To reflect confirmed LT=3 I set L explicit=3. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the most recent 5 demand observations to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service under longer LT and high demand while keeping volatility based on the latest regime.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical concludes show a sustained lead-time of 3 periods (multiple orders observed with lead_time=3) and a persistent demand regime shift starting at Period_16 (much higher mean since then). To ensure pipeline covers actual arrivals and to avoid under-ordering given delayed/lost shipments, I set lead time explicitly to 3. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 (the most recent 20 demand samples) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime and its volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand while balancing holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48: on-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time consistently observed as 3 periods (multiple P\u2192P+3 arrivals). Pipeline is large but shipments historically shift to LT=3, so set L explicitly to 3 to align ordering horizon with realized arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. This handles missing/delayed shipments by stretching the review+lead forecast to the confirmed 3-period lead time.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_49: demand has been in the elevated regime since Period_16 (~200+ units). On-hand=0, in-transit=872 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show frequent actual lead_time=3 periods\u2014majority of observed arrivals are 3. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (reflecting confirmed ~3). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent stable high-demand regime while capping N per rules. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat to cover elevated demand and 3-period deliveries) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=872. Historical concludes repeatedly show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P4, P5\u2192P8, P9\u2192P12, P11\u2192P14, P13\u2192P16, P14\u2192P17 and many others), so use observed lead-time average. Demand regime shifted up around Period_16 (sustained higher demands thereafter); to capture the current high-demand regime I use a recent-window estimate with N=20 (recent 20 periods) for demand mean and std. These choices (L via calculate, mu_hat/sigma_hat via recent_N N=20) bias the OR engine toward larger base stock to avoid stockouts under confirmed longer lead time and higher demand while letting the backend cap limit moderate order sizes to control holding cost.
