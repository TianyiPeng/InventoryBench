Planning horizon & safety: promised lead time L=2 means we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand between order decision and when stock can be used. Given unreliable pipeline, do not rely on in-transit; treat current order as primary supply. Order quantity: target = 3 \xd7 recent-period mean demand \u2248 3\xd7205 = 615 units. This covers expected demand over the next 3 periods, with minimal extra safety stock because holding cost is low ($1) vs profit ($19) and stockouts are very costly (lost sales). I therefore place an order of 615 units. I reject OR's 0-unit recommendation because OR assumes promised lead time and uses all historical samples; current reality shows sustained high demand and an unreliable pipeline so OR would under-order. Monitoring: if this new order concludes quickly, future orders can be adjusted using observed actual lead time; if it fails to conclude, we must escalate supplier/loss mitigation and continue ordering to secure stock.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows supplier can and does deliver with variable lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods) and recent concluded arrivals (P39,P40,P43) imply shipments are flowing again, but earlier long gaps indicate in-transit may be unreliable. Inventory & demand: On-hand=0, in-transit=880 (may be unreliable). Recent realized demands when stock was available are high and sustained (~160\u2013260; recent observed demands: P41\u2013P47 = 185,202,221,189,183,148,179). OR recommends 0 because it uses promised L and full history; that recommendation underestimates current high demand. Strategy & final qty: With promised L=2 we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand because orders placed now arrive after current period's demand. Using recent realized average demand \u2248190 units/period \u2192 3-period demand \u2248570. Given high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) we prefer to fill expected demand rather than risk stockouts. We therefore order 570 units to replenish supply for the next three periods (covers expected demand even if some in-transit is lost).

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: recent conclude history shows arrivals are intermittent and delayed (many orders since Period 18 had no conclude; P38\u2192P39 and P39\u2192P40 arrived but P48 order (570) did not conclude). Supplier remains unreliable\u2014some shipments arrive with lead_time=1\u20133, others appear lost/delayed. Inventory/demand: on-hand=0, in-transit=1450 but history warns in-transit often unavailable (lost/delayed). Recent realized demand when stock was available ranged ~160\u2013221 per period (Periods 39\u201346), so expected single-period demand is high. OR recommends 0 using promised L and historical averages; however given supplier unreliability and the heavy chance that new orders will not conclude before demand occurs (promised L=2 but actual varies and recent orders haven't concluded), placing a large order risks high holding cost if some portion unexpectedly arrives and also risks tying capital into lost shipments. Decision: follow OR and order 0 this period to avoid adding more at-risk pipeline given unclear ETA and prior lost shipments. This minimizes holding cost and avoids increasing exposure to supplier uncertainty while we wait for clear concluded arrivals to re-establish reliable lead time.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows highly unreliable supplier deliveries (many orders not concluding for long stretches and deliveries arriving with variable lead times). Recent periods show large in-transit (1450) but many past in-transit units were effectively unavailable or lost; therefore I treat in-transit as unreliable and do not fully trust it for meeting imminent demand. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 0. Recent demand (Periods 31\u201349) averages roughly ~190\u2013200 per period with frequent values 160\u2013260; use a conservative single-period demand \u2248200. With promised L=2, I must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after decision), so nominal coverage = 200\xd73 = 600 units. Given high profit vs low holding cost (profit=$19, holding=$1 \u2192 critical fractile \u22480.95 \u2192 strong bias toward stocking), add safety implicit in using 3-period coverage. OR recommended 0 but it ignores lost/delayed shipments; I override OR and order 600 units to ensure immediate coverage if recent in-transit fails to arrive. Strategy: Order 600 now to provide enough on-hand when/if arrivals fail; monitor concluded arrivals next periods to update lead-time belief and adjust future orders. ",
