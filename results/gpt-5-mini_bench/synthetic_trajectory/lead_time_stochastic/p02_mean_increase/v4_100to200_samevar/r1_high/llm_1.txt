Demand regime: historical samples show strong demand with recent periods mostly high (P1=105, P3=108, P4=110, P5=96) and one low outlier (P2=36). A conservative short-term forecast uses the modal/high baseline ~105 units/period rather than the lower outlier. Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time = 2 periods; currently on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals to infer deviations or losses. Decision logic: with promised L=2 we should cover L+1=3 periods of demand (current period's demand occurs after decision). Using 105 units/period -> target coverage = 105*3 = 315 units. This balances high service (avoid lost sales at $19 profit/unit) against modest holding cost ($1/unit/period). Order 315 units to fill the pipeline.",

Ordering now will not affect availability until at least Period_4 (order placed in Period_2 arrives in Period_4 if L=2), so placing additional units now only increases holding cost risk if in-transit arrives as promised.
