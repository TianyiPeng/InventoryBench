Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals yet (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show mean \u2248 91 (samples: 105,36,108,110,96). Promised lead time used (no observed lead-time evidence). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given lack of regime change or delayed shipments.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=143 (order placed P1 has not concluded/arrived). Only one conclude available showing P1 order arrived=0; insufficient evidence to change promised lead time. Use promised lead time and demand history (five-sample series) for forecasts. Choose default L (promised), default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine uses full-sample demand statistics while accounting for the 2-period promised lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=280 (orders placed earlier have not concluded). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence actual lead time differs. Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. Demand history (105,36,108,110,96) shows no sustained regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost while awaiting confirmed arrivals.

Daily Profit: $0.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_4. On-hand=0, in-transit=349 (orders placed P1=143, P2=137, P3=69) but no arrivals have concluded for those orders. Promised lead time=2 but three consecutive periods show arrived=0 for prior orders, indicating actual lead time is longer than promised or shipments delayed/lost. To protect service level I set L explicitly to 3 (conservative extension). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the OR engine compute base-stock and cap given the longer lead time and the full historical demand sample set.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >2: orders from Periods 1-3 (total 349 units) have not arrived by Period_3 conclude, indicating sustained delay or lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $240.00, Daily Holding Cost: $152.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent concluded arrivals reveal variable actual lead times (P1->P4 W=3; P3->P4 W=1) and P2's order remains missing. On-hand=152, in-transit=228 -> pipeline+on-hand=380 which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at the historical mean if L\u22482. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability and missing arrivals). For demand forecast and volatility I use 'default' so the backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, providing a stable baseline given limited data and mixed lead-time signals. This balances service (higher L raises mu_hat) against holding cost while acknowledging overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed variable with observed lead_times: 3 (P1->P4) and 1 (P3->P4); average \u22482. Order from Period_2 (137 units) still not arrived by Period_4 conclude -> delayed or possibly lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: on-hand=88, in-transit=272. Historical demand samples mean=91 (Periods 1-5). Observed concluded lead_times: 3 (P1->P4) and 1 (P3->P4) => average \u22482. Several earlier orders remain unconfirmed (possible lost/delayed shipments). To let the OR backend infer actual lead time from observations, use L=calculate (avg observed). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set\u2014this keeps forecast anchored to historical demand while allowing the backend to adjust safety stock given the inferred lead time and thus hedge against the observed shipment variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $352.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W=3 for P1->P4 and W=1 for P3->P4) while P2's shipment remains missing\u2014indicating variability and some lost/delayed shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=324 so pipeline partly covers upcoming demand but uncertainty in arrivals remains. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 3 and 1 observations). For demand I select 'default' for mu_hat and 'default' for sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging full-sample stability while accounting for the inferred lead time. This balances service (by increasing coverage for the longer observed lead time) against holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=26, in-transit=327. Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = {3 (P1->P4), 1 (P3->P4), 3 (P4->P7)} \u2192 recent average \u22482.33. Several early orders remain unconfirmed (possible losses/delays). I set L via recent_N (N=3) to have the backend use the most recent observed lead-time behavior. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default to rely on the full-sample demand statistics (stable demand history) while the adjusted L captures the increased/variable transit times; this balances service level (larger pipeline due to longer lead) versus holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Profit: $492.00, Daily Holding Cost: $41.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $451.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent actual demand has increased and become more volatile (last 5 period demands: P4=60, P5=64, P6=111, P7=65, P8=123; mean=84.6). On-hand=41, in-transit=245; several early orders remain unconfirmed (notably Period_2 order=137). Observed lead times vary (1 and 3), so use empirical average lead time. Set L by calculating average of all observed lead times to capture variability. For demand forecast and uncertainty use recent_N=5 (last 5 periods) to adapt to the newer higher-variance regime and keep safety stock aligned with recent demand. These choices balance service (capture recent demand spike) against holding cost given existing large in-transit volume and possible lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variable, observed lead_times = {3,1,3,3,1}, average \u22482.2 (Periods 1->4,3->4,4->7,5->8,7->8); Order from Period_2 (137 units) still not arrived by Period_8 conclude -> likely delayed or lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $388.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = {3,1,3,3,1,1} (avg = 2.0). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 292. Given variable but overall average lead time \u22482, I set L via calculate (use observed average). Demand samples mean = (105+36+108+110+96)/5 = 91; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) lets the OR backend compute base-stock and cap with the inferred lead time while using all historical demand to avoid overreacting to recent volatility. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: on-hand=0, in-transit=405. Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = {3,1,3,3,1,1} \u2192 average = 2.0, so I trust the empirical average. Use L='calculate' to let backend set lead time = observed average. Demand history (samples 105,36,108,110,96) is short and shows mean ~91; no clear sustained demand regime shift. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L informed by observed lead times. This balances service level (using confirmed lead time) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock and past delayed shipments.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12: on-hand=0, in-transit=405. Historical concluded lead_times are variable (observed W={3,1,3,3,1,1} across prior concludes) suggesting actual average lead_time > promised 2; several early orders remain missing/delayed. I choose L.method='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures variable/longer lead_time). For demand, I select mu_hat.method='default' and sigma_hat.method='default' so the backend uses all samples ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to set base-stock and cap \u2014 conservative pooling of all history given volatility and missing shipments. This balances higher safety stock for service (accounting for longer effective lead time) against holding cost using the OR engine's q tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $224.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent concluded history shows variable lead times and intermittent long delays. On-hand=128, in-transit=189; pipeline + on-hand provides coverage but there is at least one likely-lost shipment (Period_2 order still never arrived). Observed concluded lead times span 1\u20133 periods; I select L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed variability). For demand, use 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (conservative pooling across history). This balances service (using empirically averaged L) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand+pipeline while acknowledging past lost/delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed variable with average \u22482.12 (observed lead_times from concludes = {3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2}); Order from Period_2 (137 units) still not arrived by Period_12 conclude \u2192 likely lost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: on-hand=22, in-transit=252. Historical concluded lead_times are variable (observed set avg \u22482.12) and some early shipments (Period_2: 137u) likely lost/delayed but already recorded. To reflect realized variable lead time I set L=calculate so backend will use the average of observed lead times. Demand has no clearly new sustained regime since prior records; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine balance service level (profit/holding tradeoff) automatically given the revised L. This keeps orders responsive to the confirmed longer/variable lead time while avoiding overreacting to recent noise given limited sustained demand shift evidence.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Recent concludes show variable actual lead times (observed values include 3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2) with evidence of delayed/lost shipments (notably Period_2 order still never concluded). On-hand=0, in-transit=359 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrival timing is uncertain. Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability > promised 2). Use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand across (1+L) using full sample history; this balances service level against holding cost given lead-time uncertainty and substantial in-transit volume.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 16. On-hand=0, in-transit=391. Historical concludes show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133 periods) and some lost/delayed shipments (notably Period_2 order never concluded). To capture true delivery experience I let the backend compute average observed lead time (method=calculate). For demand I use default aggregators so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples respectively, letting the OR engine combine the inferred L with the full sample history. This balances service (using observed lead-time average) vs holding cost without overfitting short-term noise from delayed/lost shipments.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 17, on-hand=0, in-transit=328. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20133, average slightly >2) and at least one likely lost shipment (Period 2 order). To capture the observed variability in lead time I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded history (method=calculate). Demand historical samples are limited; use backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are computed consistently with chosen L. This balances service (accounting for longer/variable lead times) against holding cost; using backend-calculated L keeps our policy responsive to observed lead-time variation while default mu/sigma avoid overfitting to short noisy sample set. Note: in-transit=328 already provides pipeline cover\u2014OR engine will cap orders accordingly.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=325. Historical concludes show variable lead times with multiple 3s and 1s; recent overall average lead time \u22482.1, so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has shifted higher in recent periods (Periods 13-17 demands = 106,140,99,227,186); to capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the most recent demand pattern. This raises target base-stock to favor service (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies high service level) while sigma recent_N controls safety stock sizing against recent variability.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Recent demand samples (periods 1-5) mean=91 units; profit/holding costs favor moderate service. On-hand=0, in-transit=567 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers upcoming demand but historical concludes show variable lead times (some 1\u20133, average \u22482.1) and a likely lost order (Period_2). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed average lead time from concluded messages (captures variability > promised 2). For demand forecast I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level versus holding cost given large in-transit inventory and uncertain lead times.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand has risen substantially vs early samples (last 8 demand samples: 88,106,140,99,227,186,210,171) \u2014 clear regime uplift. I choose L='calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures variable/longer-than-promised behavior). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the elevated recent regime, so the OR backend raises base-stock to protect service during higher demand while balancing holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W={3,1,3,3,1,3,2,3,3} across concludes) averaging \u22482.1 and multiple delayed/lost shipments (notably early Period_2 order never concluded). Demand samples (provided) have mean=91. I choose L by 'calculate' to let the backend use the empirical average lead time from concluded messages (captures observed variability/delays). For demand sizing I use 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this is conservative given high in-transit stock and uncertain arrivals, balancing service (larger L expands coverage) against holding cost.

To reflect observed variability I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), leveraging all historical demand samples while letting L adjust the review+lead multiplier; this balances service level (accounts for longer observed lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23. Recent demand has shifted up and sustained: Periods 16-22 demands = {227,186,210,171,209,187,173} (7 periods) \u2014 a higher regime vs earlier ~100s. On-hand=0, in-transit=649 units (large pipeline; some past shipments likely lost/delayed). Lead times historically variable (mix of 1\u20133+) with average >2; we cannot assume promised L=2. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. For demand, use recent_N with N=7 to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the new higher-demand regime (captures (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility over the sustained 7-period regime). This balances service level for the higher demand while recognizing substantial pipeline inventory (which the OR engine will account for when capping orders) and the history of delayed/lost shipments.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27: recent demand samples are high and volatile (history shows bursts up to ~227); on-hand=0, in-transit=567. Historical conclude messages show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133 periods) with some likely lost shipments. I select L=calculate to let the backend average observed lead times (captures variability documented in concludes). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I choose default so the backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) to produce a stable base-stock that balances service level vs holding cost given lead-time uncertainty.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=567. Historical concludes show variable lead times (observed set yields average \u22482.12) and earlier long-missing orders (e.g., Period_2) likely lost; demand has shifted up sharply since Period_16. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures variable/>2 behavior rather than promised=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 16\u201327) because a sustained regime shift began at Period_16 with mean demand \u2248194 units vs prior sample mean \u224891 \u2014 this reflects current high-demand regime and ensures base_stock covers (1+L) periods of elevated demand. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=12 to reflect increased volatility in the same recent regime. This combination prioritizes service in the new high-demand regime while the calculated L helps account for observed lead-time variability and potential delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period16: avg increased from 91.0 to 194.1 (+113.1, +124%)

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=750. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times with multiple observed values and a long-standing pattern (average \u22482.1); therefore use calculated average lead time to capture realized variability. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift around Period_16 (pre-shift mean \u224891, post-shift mean \u2248194). Use recent_N (N=13, periods 16\u201328) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the higher, sustained demand regime. This setup increases target base-stock to meet service under higher demand while sigma_hat based on the same recent window captures current variability; using calculated L aligns ordering cadence with observed lead-time behavior and helps the OR backend balance the higher stock needed for service against holding cost.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30: on-hand=0, in-transit=750. Historical concludes show variable lead times averaging \u22482.1 and multiple delayed/lost shipments; demand regime shifted up at Period16 (avg \u2248194 thereafter). To account for observed lead-time variability I let OR compute the empirical average lead time from concluded history (method=calculate). For demand I use a recent_N estimate over the post-changepoint regime (Period16\u2013Period29, N=14) so mu_hat reflects the (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent high-demand regime. I also set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=14) so volatility matches the current regime. These choices push the backend to target stock for the new higher-demand regime while letting the calculated L incorporate observed longer/variable lead times and the large in-transit inventory be reconciled by the engine when computing pipeline coverage.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=567. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times averaging \u22482+ and some earlier lost/delayed shipments; demand regime increased sharply from Period_16 onward (avg \u2248194). To capture observed lead-time variability use 'calculate' (average of observed lead times). To reflect the sustained high-demand regime, set demand forecast and volatility from the recent regime samples: use recent_N with N=15 (regime length Period_16\u201330 = 15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L) scaling is applied to the recent high-demand mean and std. This balances service (higher mu_hat to cover elevated demand) against holding cost while accounting for lead-time variability and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=756. Historical concludes show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133 periods) with average slightly >2 and some lost/delayed shipments; demand regime shift at Period_16 raised mean substantially. Set L using observed lead times average so OR backend accounts for realized variability. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Period_16 onward) to capture the higher demand level and recent variability (N=16). This balances service (higher forecast after the sustained jump) vs holding cost, while relying on the backend\u2019s lead-time-aware ordering cap; using observed-average L helps mitigate lost/delayed shipment risk by increasing pipeline coverage.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent history shows variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20133 periods, average \u22482) and a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning Period 16 (avg before \u224891, after \u2248194). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 567 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers several periods of elevated demand but some very old orders (Period 2) appear lost historically. To reflect observed variable lead times use calculated average from concluded messages (helps OR account for realized variability). For demand I target the post-shift regime using recent samples since Period 16 to capture higher mean/volatility; I select recent_N with N equal to the regime length to produce mu_hat and sigma_hat that match the new demand level and limit stockouts while controlling holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. On-hand=0, in-transit=751. Historical concludes show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133, recent average \u22482.1) and a sustained demand regime shift at Period 16 (avg rose ~+124%). I set L using 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times from concluded history (captures the variable/longer realized lead time). For demand I use recent_N (N=18) to base mu_hat on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201333, regime_length=18) so the (1+L) forecast reflects the higher recent mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=18) to measure volatility in that same regime. These choices prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute the safety stock given the inferred lead-time average.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Demand has a sustained regime shift upward starting Period_16 (post-shift avg \u2248194 units); recent realized demands ~170\u2013237. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-Period_16 high-demand regime (regime length ~21 periods -> cap N=20). This biases base-stock and cap toward higher coverage to avoid stockouts given high demand and variable lead times while accepting holding cost trade-off.

LLM Rationale:
Period_37: on-hand=0, in-transit=753. Historical concludes show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133), overall average >2; demand regime increased around Period_16 (higher mean since P16). In-transit (753) is large relative to recent demand, so avoid inflating orders. Set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate) so backend uses actual average observed. For demand forecast and volatility use recent data from the post-changepoint regime (most recent 20 periods) to capture the higher demand level while smoothing older low-demand samples. This balances service (higher mu_hat across review+lead) against holding cost given a large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38: on-hand=0, in-transit=751 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers upcoming demand but includes delayed/lost arrivals historically (notably Period_2 order still missing). Observed concluded lead_times are variable around ~2.1; there is a sustained demand regime shift up at Period 16 (higher mean ~194). To reflect actual lead-time variability, set L by observed average ('calculate'). To forecast demand over review+lead, focus on the recent high-demand regime (post-Period16); use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases orders on the current elevated mean and volatility while the calculate L acknowledges lead-time drift/delays. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost by grounding forecasts in the recent regime and observed lead-time behavior. Overdue/lost shipments flagged: earlier Period_2 order remains unarrived and likely lost/delayed \u2014 hence reliance on recent demand rather than historic early low-demand periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39: on-hand=0, in-transit=753. Historical concluded lead_times show variable but centered \u22482 (observed series includes 1,2,3 values across many periods) and several long/delayed shipments (some orders likely lost). I choose L.method='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures actual variability vs promised 2). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand (including the sustained higher-demand regime detected at Period16) while letting the OR engine combine those stats with the computed L. This balances service level (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and uncertain arrivals.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40: on-hand=0, in-transit=751. Historical concluded lead_times are variable (mix of 1\u20133, recent pattern shows variability). Demand regime shifted up at Period_16 (higher mean ~194 vs 91). To capture recent lead-time variability use a recent average; to capture elevated demand and current volatility use recent demand samples. Chosen: L via recent_N to reflect recent realized lead times; mu_hat recent_N using last 5 demand observations (periods 35\u201339) to reflect the post-shift higher demand; sigma_hat recent_N using last 5 to reflect current demand volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while letting the OR backend size safety stock for observed lead-time variability and avoid excessive holding cost given on-hand=0 and large in-transit.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=751. Historical concludes show variable lead times (multiple 1\u20133 period observations) with long-running missing shipment from Period_2; average observed lead time \u22482.12. Demand regime shifted up at Period_16 (recent avg \u2248194). To reflect confirmed variable/long lead behavior use 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average. For demand we target the post-changepoint high-demand regime using recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent ~20 periods of the high-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets base stock to service the higher mean while accounting for recent volatility. This balances holding cost against the high lost-sale penalty (profit $4 vs holding $1) and the large in-transit pipeline: we rely on the backend cap but bias mu_hat/sigma_hat toward the sustained higher-demand regime.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: demand has been in a higher regime since Period_16 (sustained higher weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=761 \u2014 large pipeline but past history shows variable lead times (concluded lead_times \u22482.12). Use calculated L to let backend infer average actual lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand forecast and volatility, use recent_N (N=20) to focus on the post-Period_16 high-demand regime (caps N at 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated demand and variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_43. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_16 (sustained higher means); current on-hand=0, in-transit=766 (large pipeline but historical concludes show variable lead times and some lost/delayed shipments). Use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures variability vs promised L=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to base forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (last 20 samples) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean over (1+L) review+lead period. For sigma_hat use recent_N (N=20) to capture recent volatility rather than diluting with older low-demand periods. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while letting the OR engine apply service-level tradeoffs given the inferred lead-time.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. On-hand=0, in-transit=766 units. Historical concluded lead_times = {3,1,3,3,1,1,3,2,3,2,2,1,2,1} \u2192 average \u2248 2.0, so I use calculated L to reflect observed reality. Demand sample mean = 91 (Periods 1\u20135); with L\u22482 I keep mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean) to let backend compute the review+lead demand. Variability will be left to the backend (sigma_hat default) using all samples. Large in-transit pipeline already provides coverage vs. immediate spikes, so no explicit upweighting of demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=0, in-transit=756. Promised L=2 but historical concludes show variable lead times averaging slightly >2 and some lost shipments; however recent long-run average \u22482.12. Demand regime shifted up at Period_16 (higher mean ~194) and has persisted \u2014 use recent demand window reflecting post-shift behavior. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to capture variable/occasionally >2 delays. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to anchor forecasts/volatility on the sustained high-demand regime (post-Period_16). Large in-transit (756) likely covers upcoming demand for several periods; parameters chosen to avoid over-ordering while maintaining service given higher demand and occasional lead-time lengthening.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=776. Historical concludes show variable lead_times around 2 (mix of 1\u20133); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand jumped materially after Period_16 and has stayed high (~180\u2013250); to reflect the new regime use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)-period forecast and volatility rely on the most recent 20 samples. This raises target base-stock to preserve service during high demand while the large in-transit lowers urgent ordering; the settings balance service level vs holding cost under observed lead-time variability.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=781. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20133, average \u22482.1) and evidence of missing/lost early shipments; demand regime increased at Period_16 (avg \u2248194 thereafter). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history rather than the promised 2. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime since Period_16 (use last 20 post-changepoint samples) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean across the review+lead horizon. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to match the higher demand regime while using observed lead-time data to guard against under-ordering given delayed/lost shipments.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period_16 (noted +124%). Large pipeline (in-transit=781) and many historical variable lead-times; concluded lead-times show variability but average >2. I set L via 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-times history (captures variable/ >2 mean). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to focus forecast on the established high-demand regime (Periods 29-48 contain the post-change behavior; N=20 balances recency and sample size). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 so volatility reflects recent high-demand period. These choices help the OR backend size base-stock to meet service with limited holding cost exposure given many outstanding shipments.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=781. Historical concluded lead_times show varied values (many 3s and 1s) with average >2; demand regime shifted up at Period_16 (sustained higher demand since). I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times from concluded messages (captures variable actual lead time > promised 2). For demand level (mu_hat) I use 'recent_N' with N=20 to focus the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime that began at Period_16 (use last 20 demand samples to reflect current elevated mean across the review+lead period). For sigma_hat I also use 'recent_N' with N=20 to estimate volatility from the recent high-demand regime. These choices aim to keep base-stock responsive to the higher recent demand while letting the backend account for observed lead-time behavior; using recent data reduces stockouts during the elevated-demand regime while avoiding excessive long-term holding given holding cost.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=0, in-transit=781. Historical concludes show variable/average actual lead_time \u22482.22 (many concludes with 1\u20133 periods, multiple delayed/lost shipments historically). Demand regime shift at Period16 raised mean demand substantially; recent demand has been in the higher regime. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average (~2.22) inferred from conclude messages. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-Period16 high-demand regime (regime length >20); this makes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect current elevated demand and variability. These choices prioritize service (higher base stock) given high profit ($4) relative to holding ($1) and the observed shipment variability; using recent data reduces understock risk from the sustained demand increase while acknowledging variable lead times and delayed arrivals.
