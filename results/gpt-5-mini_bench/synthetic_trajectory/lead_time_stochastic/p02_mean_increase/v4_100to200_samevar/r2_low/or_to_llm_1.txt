Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observed actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed earlier: Period 1 order arrived in Period 4 and multiple subsequent confirms with 3). Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 874. With L=3 we must cover (L+1)=4 periods of demand. Recent demand (Periods 45\u201349) averages \u2248173; earlier high regime around Periods 16\u201323 was higher (~200+), but recent five-period average is lower. Conservatively using a high demand estimate of 200 units/period \u2192 4-period demand = 800 units. In-transit 874 > 800 so pipeline already covers the required coverage given lead time 3. Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1 (high holding cost equal to profit) so avoid creating excess inventory. OR recommends 0; given confirmed lead time=3 and sufficient pipeline I follow OR and place 0 units to minimize holding cost and avoid overstock.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Actual lead time=3 and in-transit 874 units already covers ~4 periods of demand (~800 if demand=200/period), so place 0 to avoid costly holding.",
