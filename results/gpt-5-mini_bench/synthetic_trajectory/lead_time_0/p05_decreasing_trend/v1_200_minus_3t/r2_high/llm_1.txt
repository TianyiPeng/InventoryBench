No later-period evidence of a sustained regime change. c) Lead time & missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0.

Using the historical Period_1 sample (217 units) as the best unbiased forecast and avoiding unnecessary overstock (holding cost = $1/unit/period vs. profit = $19/unit), I order 217 units to meet expected demand while minimizing excess holding costs.",

  "rationale": "World & product: chips(Regular) is a high-margin snack (Profit $19/unit) with low per-period holding cost ($1/unit). When dates are available we should watch for calendar spikes, but no calendar events are provided for Period_42. Demand analysis: recent true demands (observed per-period demand) show volatility but a central tendency near ~100. Last five period demands: P37=105, P38=83, P39=0 (clear outlier), P40=66, P41=118. The mean including the outlier is ~74, median ~83; ignoring the anomalous P39 and weighting recent upward movement (P40\u2192P41) suggests an expected demand around 90\u2013115 for Period_42. Lead time / pipeline: carry-over confirmed earlier (Period 4) that actual lead time = 0 periods; recent concludes continue to show same-period arrivals (e.g., Period 41 order arrived in Period 41). Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so no inventory will cover Period_42 unless we order now. Decision logic: with profit $19 >> holding $1, the penalty for understock (lost high-margin sales) is much larger than the moderate holding cost. Given the short/confirmed lead time (0), we can safely order to meet expected demand plus a small safety buffer. I choose a conservative buffer to cover a likely demand near or slightly above 100 while avoiding excessive holding cost. Final order: 110 units (arrives this period and will be available to meet Period_42 demand).",

A robust short-term forecast uses the recent non-outlier levels \u2014 median \u2248 83, 5-period mean \u2248 70 (pulled down by the 0). c) Lead time / pipeline: historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (Period 4 insight).
