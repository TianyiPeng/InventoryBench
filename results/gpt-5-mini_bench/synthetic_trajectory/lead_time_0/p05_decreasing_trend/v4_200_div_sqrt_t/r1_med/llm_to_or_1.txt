Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no 'conclude' messages yet so no observed arrivals or lead-time evidence. Historical samples (periods 1-5) have mean demand = 134.6 units and show no sustained changepoint (5 samples only). Promised lead time applies and there is no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Using defaults keeps the OR engine's standard base-stock logic: L=default (promised lead time), mu_hat=default -> (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples = 134.6 (with L=0), sigma_hat=default -> sqrt(1+L)*std_of_all_samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 / unit and holding=$1 / unit by letting the backend compute z* from cost ratio. If shipments begin to arrive late or demand shows a sustained shift (>=3 periods) I'll switch to recent_N or explicit estimates.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded message (Period 1 conclude) shows the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1: arrived=177 units (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 0 periods). Demand sample history for chips(Regular) is available (Periods 1-5: 204,155,134,72,108). Given the single observed lead-time datapoint equals the promised lead time and no evidence of delays or lost shipments yet, I use the observed-average lead time to let the OR backend know actual recent experience. For demand forecast and volatility I use the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_of_all_samples, leveraging all available demand samples to form mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service level (using full-sample mean to avoid underordering after the Period 1 stockout) against holding cost; if future conclude messages show lead-time or demand regime changes, I'll switch to recent_N or explicit methods.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 context: recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 both arrived within the same period (observed lead_times = 0). On-hand = 66, in-transit = 0, so there are no overdue shipments. Historical demand samples provided (Periods 1\u20135 = 204,155,134,72,108) show a mean demand ~134.6 and standard deviation ~44.4. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded evidence confirms actual lead time = 0 (two samples), so I keep L as default (promised). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat makes the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; with L=0 this targets a single-period forecast centered on the full-sample mean and volatility. This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies moderate service quantile) while avoiding over-ordering given current on-hand = 66 and no in-transit units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $254.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 context: observed concluded lead times for Periods 1-3 are all 0 (orders placed arrived same period). On-hand=98, in-transit=0. Recent demand appears lower than the earlier two-sample history (downtrend across recent periods). I set L using 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent regime (recent mean materially below longer-run mean) so the base-stock reflects current lower demand; this reduces overstock risk given holding cost = $1 vs profit $4. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent lower variability and avoid inflating safety stock. These choices balance service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding excess inventory given the clear recent downward demand pattern and no in-transit stock or delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $228.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 context: historical concluded lead times = 0 for Periods 1-4 (arrivals same period as order). Demand history (Periods 1-5): [204,155,134,72,108]. Current on-hand=108, in-transit=0. I see no sustained changepoint in demand or lead time: recent demands vary but show no multi-period shift. Therefore I keep L as default (promised lead time 0). Using default mu_hat computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 1*134.6 (mean of 673/5), and default sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2248 44.4. This choice signals the OR engine to target a base-stock near historical mean demand while honoring the confirmed zero lead time and avoiding extra safety stock given holding cost is moderate relative to profit. With on-hand=108 and no in-transit, the backend will order to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the base-stock computed from these historical moments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $307.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start: on-hand=77, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u20135 show every order arrived in the same period it was placed (lead_time=0), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Historical demand samples (periods 1\u20135) show moderate mean and variability (samples: 204,155,134,72,108). With holding cost = $1 and profit = $4, the backend base-stock policy will compute service-level q and corresponding z from profit/(profit+holding). I therefore choose default methods so the OR engine uses the full historical sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). Using default L keeps promised lead time (0) aligned with observed arrivals; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level and holding cost given stable lead time and no in-transit inventory. Given on-hand=77 and no in-transit, this will let the engine decide an order to top up to the computed base-stock while capping order size per its cap logic.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders placed in Periods 1\u20135 all arrived same period: P1\u2192P1, P2\u2192P2, P3\u2192P3, P4\u2192P4, P5\u2192P5).

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 decision. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20136) shows same-period arrivals and stable sample demands: [204,155,134,72,108,81]. On-hand = 87, in-transit = 0 so available inventory is sufficient for near-term demand but we must still restock to balance service vs holding cost. All concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20136 were same-period (lead time = 0 consistently), so no overdue shipments or lost orders to account for. I choose to use default lead time (promised L=0) because concluded evidence strongly confirms 0-period lead time. For demand forecast and volatility I select defaults so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L); this keeps the backend's base-stock anchored to the full historical demand pattern while relying on confirmed lead time. These settings balance service-level (using full-sample demand) against holding cost given moderate on-hand inventory and confirmed fast replenishment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $156.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 context: observed confirmed lead time = 0 (carry-over). Recent demand has declined from early high levels (P1=207) to more moderate values (P3\u2013P7: 88, 84, 96, 81, 64), suggesting a lower recent demand regime. Current inventory: on-hand=100, in-transit=0. Expected next-period demand (using recent behavior) is ~82.6 units (mean of last 5 periods). With lead time = 0, orders arrive same period and there is no pipeline lag; therefore we set L to default (promised lead time). To reflect the recent downward demand regime and be responsive, mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 (so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Volatility is also estimated from the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=5) so safety stock reflects current demand variability rather than older, higher-demand periods. This combination keeps target base-stock close to current demand, avoids excessive holding cost (holding=$1/unit) while maintaining service given profit=$4/unit (OR backend will convert profit/holding into service quantile). On-hand (100) already covers roughly 1.2\xd7 the recent-period mean (~82.6), so the OR engine will likely place little or no order this period; if demand rebounds, recent_N framing lets us adapt quickly by increasing future mu_hat if new higher demands persist.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: recent realized demand has fallen from early-period highs to a lower steady level over Periods 4\u20138 (demands: 84,96,81,64,76). On-hand = 24, in-transit = 0 => current coverage is well below recent demand rates. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. I detect a downward demand regime relative to Periods 1\u20133, so I base demand forecast on the most recent 5 periods (Periods 4\u20138) to capture the new lower mean and reduced variability. Therefore: L = default (promised 0). mu_hat = recent_N with N=5 so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples (approx 80.2 units demand per period). sigma_hat = recent_N with N=5 so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std of last 5 samples (captures recent volatility ~10\u201311). These choices prioritize matching the OR engine to the confirmed 0 lead time and the most recent lower-demand regime so ordering avoids chronic overstocking while maintaining service given the observed variability. Given on-hand=24 and no in-transit, this will prompt the OR engine toward a replenishment to bring pipeline+on-hand closer to the recent-period base stock target.

Daily Reward (R_t): $204.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 decision. Current on-hand=32, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand has fallen vs early periods: Periods 1\u20134 had high values (207,126,88,84 were earlier sells but initial sample set showed 204,155,134,72,108) while the last five concluded-period demands (Periods 5\u20139) are 96,81,64,76,59, indicating a sustained lower-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concludes. Given the clear downward shift starting around Period_5, I choose to base demand forecasts on the most recent 5 periods to avoid excess ordering and holding cost. Therefore: L use default (promised lead time = 0); mu_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the lower recent mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples); sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock and cap compared with using the full-sample mean, lowering the chance of overstock and holding cost while maintaining adequate service for current demand levels. Orders should be sized conservatively because on-hand is 32 and no in-transit inventory is expected to arrive before demand is realized (lead time 0 means same-period arrival only for orders placed now, but history confirms arrivals happen same period when placed \u2014 backend will treat L as promised).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 decision. Current on-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (Period 1\u201310 concludes all show same-period arrivals). Recent demand (Periods 6\u201310 = 81, 64, 76, 59, 59) is materially lower than the earlier periods, suggesting a downward demand regime that appears sustained for 5 periods. Given confirmed zero lead time, I use the promised/default lead time to let the OR backend assume L=0. For demand level I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the most recent lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands). For variability I also use recent_N (N=5) so sigma_hat captures recent reduced volatility. This keeps target base-stock lower to avoid excess holding cost while still supporting a high service quantile (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high critical ratio). With on-hand=29 and no pipeline, these parameters should let the OR engine place conservative replenishment aligned to recent demand while leveraging the confirmed fast (same-day) delivery.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: current on-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times P1\u2013P11 all show arrivals same period, so actual lead time confirmed 0 (matches promised). Demand has declined from earlier high (P1=207) to a lower recent regime: Periods 7\u201311 demands = [64,76,59,59,66], recent mean \u224864.8 vs overall mean \u224891.5. On-hand is low relative to one-period demand, so set parameters to target the recent lower-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost. Therefore: L='default' (use promised 0); mu_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and capture the new lower demand regime; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to reflect reduced recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the confirmed zero lead time and reduces overstock risk from older higher-demand periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 context: on-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Period 1\u201312 concluded arrivals match same-period orders), so promised lead time = actual lead time. Recent demand (Periods 1\u201312) shows variability but no sustained regime shift (demands range ~38\u2013207 with no 3+ period persistent jump). Given immediate fulfillment (L=0) and modest holding cost relative to profit (profit $4, holding $1), I select default methods so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This keeps service targeted by the backend\u2019s base-stock formula while avoiding overfitting to short recent swings and limiting unnecessary holding costs. No overdue shipments are present.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: on-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show confirmed lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period through Period 13). Demand samples available to the OR engine are the provided historical series; no recent sustained demand regime shift is evident (demand has fluctuated but no 3+ period persistent change). Given immediate same-period replenishment and a desire to balance service level (profit $4/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period), I use the default lead time (promised 0) so the backend treats review+lead horizon correctly as (1+L)=1. I also select default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this leverages the full sample set without overreacting to short-term noise and avoids overstock given non-negligible holding cost. No in-transit units exist, so the engine will cap orders appropriately to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the computed base stock.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 decision. On-hand=95, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages through Period_14 show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed earlier), and recent demand (Periods 10\u201314 = 59,66,38,82,46) is materially lower than earlier samples. To avoid overstock/holding cost while maintaining service, I set lead time to the promised/default (0) consistent with confirmed evidence, and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current lower-demand regime (covers (1+L) periods). This reduces unnecessary ordering driven by older high-demand samples and balances profit vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 context: on-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical conclude data (Periods 1\u201315) shows a clear downward shift from the very high early demands (Periods 1\u20133) to a lower, more stable regime in recent periods (roughly Periods 7\u201315) with typical demand in the ~40\u201380 range. All observed orders arrived same period (lead time confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over). With profit $4 and holding $1 (service quantile q=0.8) I prioritize service but avoid overstock given modest recent demand and holding cost. I therefore set L to default (use promised lead time 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime (Periods 11\u201315 have demands [66,38,82,46,62], mean \u224858.8) so the base-stock will target current demand levels rather than inflated early-period demand. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent variability. This keeps pipeline+order sizing responsive to current lower demand, reduces holding cost risk given our modest on-hand (33) and zero in-transit, and maintains a higher service level appropriate to the profit/holding ratio.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period = 17. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-time observations (Periods 1\u201316) consistently show orders arriving same period (lead_time=0), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand history is noisy but the official historical demand samples used by the estimator are the provided five-sample series; no sustained new demand regime (3+ periods) is evident that would justify deviating from the default aggregate estimates. Given zero lead time and zero pipeline, using default (promised) lead time keeps the OR engine aligned with observed arrivals; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples to balance profit vs. holding cost without overfitting to recent fluctuations. This avoids unnecessary over-ordering from short transients while ensuring the base-stock calculation accounts for observed demand variability.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: on-hand=78, in-transit=0, recent sells volatile but no sustained demand regime change. Carry-over shows lead time confirmed as 0 periods (all past concluded orders arrived same period). Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1 implies service-level target q = 4/(4+1)=0.8; I will trust the backend's default demand aggregation and variability estimates given stable historical pattern and confirmed LT=0. Using default for L (promised LT=0) keeps pipeline calculation aligned with observed deliveries. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples so base-stock and cap are set by full-sample statistics; this balances desired service level vs holding cost given no clear changepoint and current healthy on-hand inventory. If we observe sustained demand shift or shipment issues, I'll switch to a recent_N or explicit forecast.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19 context: on-hand=86, in-transit=0, recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed previously) and demand has varied but shows no new sustained regime shift. There are no overdue shipments to reconcile. Promised lead time = 0 is still supported by concluded arrivals, so I keep L as default to let backend use the promised lead time. I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) because there is no strong, sustained changepoint in demand over the recent history that justifies a recent_N or EWMA adjustment. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock calculation stable; given profit $4 and holding $1 (q = 0.8) the backend will target a relatively high service level while the default sigma handles variability. If future concluded periods show a persistent demand shift or delayed/lost shipments, I'll switch to a recent_N or explicit estimate.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20 context: on-hand=101, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1\u201319) consistently show same-period arrivals; promised lead time=0 and no recent missed shipments, so use default lead time. Demand has declined relative to the early high samples; recent realized demand (Periods 15\u201319 = 62,75,56,46,29) indicates a lower recent mean and lower volatility. I choose recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime and to avoid over-ordering given current ample on-hand stock. With profit=$4 and holding=$1 the service-level target is high (q\u22480.8) so the OR backend will add safety stock; by using recent demand stats we avoid inflating the forecast from older high-demand periods. Expected effect: mu_hat based on the last 5 periods yields (1+L)\xd7mean\u224853.6 units demand forecast for the review+lead window; with on-hand=101 this provides ~2 periods of cover, reducing holding risk while keeping service levels adequate. No evidence of new lead-time issues or sustained demand shifts beyond the recent lower-demand regime, so no carry-over insight is recorded.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 context: on-hand=73, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and carry-over confirms actual lead time=0 (sustained evidence through Period 6 onward). Recent concluded demands (Periods 1\u201320) show no sustained upward or downward regime shift\u2014demand fluctuates but remains in a similar band. With same-period arrivals, we can rely on default lead-time assumptions so the OR engine's base-stock computation using full-sample mean/variance is appropriate. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) keeps orders responsive to current demand while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise. This also ensures pipeline + on-hand will be sized to cover the current period demand (important because arrivals occur within the same period when ordered). Given profit $4 and holding $1, the backend will compute the z-margin tradeoff; my parameters prioritize stable service with moderate inventory holding given no evidence of regime change or lost shipments.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 context: on-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times (Periods 1\u201321) consistently show same-period arrivals; earlier carry-over confirmed lead time = 0. Recent demand history (concluded periods) shows demand well below early large peaks but the long-run sample mean (periods provided) is ~134.6 units. Promised lead time = 0 and concluded evidence supports using the default lead time so the OR backend uses the promised lead time. I choose default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; that gives a neutral forecast that balances service level and holding cost without overreacting to short fluctuations. With on-hand=96 (< long-run (1+L)*mean \u2248135), we expect the OR engine to place replenishment to raise pipeline toward the base-stock target. Using defaults avoids overfitting to recent low-demand windows (Periods 14\u201321) while respecting the confirmed zero lead time and the profit/holding ratio.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23 context: on-hand=88, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (carry-over). Demand history shows a clear, sustained downshift after Period 5: early-sample mean (Periods 1\u20135) was ~134.6, while recent periods (Periods 6\u201322) average ~54.9. Given the confirmed same-period arrivals and the sustained lower demand regime (17 periods), I use a recent-N forecast to reflect the new lower demand level and lower volatility. Choices: L=default to trust promised lead time (0) and concluded evidence; mu_hat=recent_N with N=17 to set (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 17 observed demands (~54.9 units), reducing over-ordering risk; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=17 to capture recent volatility for safety stock. This reduces holding cost exposure while keeping service via the OR engine's z* calculation (profit $4 vs holding $1 gives a relatively high service target). With on-hand=88 (well above recent mean) the OR backend will likely order little or nothing, avoiding excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 6: avg demand dropped from 134.6 (Periods 1\u20135) to 54.9 (Periods 6\u201322), a decline of ~59% (sustained for 17 periods).

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_24. Historical demand shows a sustained downward regime starting Period 6 (documented in provided carry-over): long-run mean across Periods 6\u201323 is much lower than Periods 1\u20135. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed through Period 6 conclude and subsequent concludes). Current on-hand = 42, in-transit = 0; no deliveries expected this period. Given the clear, sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 6\u201323 = 18 periods), I use recent_N estimates over that regime so the OR backend's base-stock reflects the lower demand and avoids excessive holding costs. L: keep default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=18 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 18 samples (Periods 6\u201323), capturing the new lower demand level. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=18 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. This combination guides the OR engine to size orders to meet a high target service level implied by profit/holding ratio while preventing overstock from outdated high-demand samples.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 decision. On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201324) consistently show arrivals in the same period they were ordered, so actual lead time = 0. A sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 is already recorded (periods 6\u201322 avg ~54.9 vs periods 1\u20135 avg 134.6). Recent demands (Periods 6\u201324) remain in the lower regime. To avoid overstocking given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4, I use a recent-regime forecast. L set to calculate (observed lead times average 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=19 (the length of the confirmed low-demand regime, capped by available samples) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant recent data. This keeps target base-stock aligned to the lower demand regime and reduces excess holding while maintaining service given high profit-to-cost ratio.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26: confirmed low-demand regime since Period_6 (carry-over). Promised lead time = 0 and historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 (orders P1\u2013P25 arrived same period). Current on-hand=37, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Recent demand (Periods 6\u201325) is substantially lower than Periods 1\u20135; I therefore target the low-demand regime for forecasting. L: use default (promised lead time=0) since actual lead time is confirmed 0 and there are no lost shipments. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to base the replenishment (1+L)\xd7mean on the 20-period low-demand regime (Periods 6\u201325) so the base stock aligns with the sustained lower demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture volatility within the same recent regime. These choices reduce overstock risk from the earlier high-demand regime while preserving service by sizing orders to the sustained lower demand; using recent data also helps the OR backend's capped ordering to avoid excessive holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27 decision. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period_6 (sustained ~17+ periods). On-hand=28, in-transit=0 so pipeline inventory is low relative to current regime demand. No overdue or lost shipments observed; confirmed lead time = 0 historically. I select L=default to trust the promised/confirmed same-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (the most recent 20 periods: Periods 7\u201326) because a clear, sustained regime change occurred at Period_6; the 20-sample recent window (N=20) captures that regime while meeting the min/max rules. The mean of those 20 recent demands is 51.2 units, so with L=0 the backend will compute mu_hat\u224851.2. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This configuration focuses the base-stock calculation on the lower, sustained demand regime\u2014reducing excess holding cost while maintaining service given same-day replenishment.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period across Periods 1\u201327). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 6: average fell from ~134.6 (P1\u2013P5) to ~54.9 (P6\u2013P22) and remained lower in subsequent periods. Given the sustained lower-demand regime (many recent low-demand observations), I bias the forecast to recent history rather than the full-sample mean. Choice summary: L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; mu_hat uses recent_N to capture the post-changepoint lower mean and avoid being pulled up by the early high-demand samples \u2014 I choose N=20 (recent 20 periods) which covers the sustained low-demand regime and smooths short noise; sigma_hat also uses recent_N with N=20 to estimate recent volatility. These settings produce a smaller base-stock (lower expected demand and appropriate safety stock) to reduce holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201328) confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime drop that began Period 6 (lower mean since then). Recent demand (Periods 24\u201328 = 53, 32, 41, 41, 34) averages ~40.2 units. Given confirmed lead time=0 and the clear, sustained lower-demand regime, I set L to default (promised = 0) and use a recent_N estimate for demand and volatility to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime. Choosing N=5 captures the most recent week of demand without overreacting to single-period noise. This keeps the base-stock (mu_hat) aligned with current demand (~40 units per period) and reduces holding cost risk while maintaining service. Sigma_hat uses the same recent_N window so safety stock reflects current variability.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 6 (carry-over insight): mean demand dropped ~59% vs Periods 1\u20135 and persisted through Period 29. Current on-hand = 15, in-transit = 0 (no overdue arrivals visible). Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201329 all concluded with lead_time 0). To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime and recent variability, I set L to default (use promised 0). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to base the forecast on the most recent 20 demand observations (captures the sustained low-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise). For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N with N=20 so safety stock reflects recent variability rather than inflated early-period volatility. Choosing N=20 follows the changepoint evidence (regime from Period 6 onward; cap recent_N at 20) and provides the OR backend with a demand forecast and uncertainty that trade off service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by reducing target base-stock relative to early high-demand samples. This should avoid unnecessary holding cost given low recent demand and zero lead time.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 context: confirmed short lead time environment (previously validated lead time = 0). Recent demand regime remains at a lower level since Period 6: mean demand for Periods 6\u201330 = 50.2 units, and the most recent 20 periods (Periods 11\u201330) show a deeper, sustained drop with mean \u2248 45.8 units and reduced variability. Current inventory: on-hand=18, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments visible. I therefore keep lead time at the promised/default (0) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime to avoid overstocking. I select recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 20 observations (Periods 11\u201330), which captures the sustained lower-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. This reduces target base-stock (limits holding costs) while maintaining service given the confirmed zero lead time and current on-hand buffer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: on-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times for Periods 1\u201331 are all 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm 0. There is a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 6 (documented in carry-over) so I weight recent low-demand behavior for forecasts. Per the guideline for recent_N, I use the most recent regime (recent 20 periods) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=20) \u2014 this captures the lower mean/volatility since the shift while remaining within the 20-period cap. This reduces target base_stock and limits holding cost given current low demand and zero lead time, while keeping service by matching OR backend to the current regime. Current on-hand (27) + zero pipeline implies limited coverage; the OR backend will use these parameters to order conservatively to avoid excess inventory given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Current on-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period across observed history). A demand regime shift began at Period 6: demand dropped materially and has stayed lower since; therefore I will base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because conclues consistently show 0 lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (the last 20 periods within the low-demand regime) per the changepoint at Period 6; N=20 is chosen as max(min(regime_length,20),3) to capture the sustained lower-demand pattern while smoothing short-term noise. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock target aligned with the lower recent mean demand, reducing excess holding cost while maintaining service by reflecting observed variability via recent sigma. With Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, this approach tightens inventory (lower mu_hat) relative to the early high-demand periods and uses recent volatility to set an appropriate safety stock.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34 context: on-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concludes reliably show actual lead time=0 (orders in P1\u2013P33 all arrived same period). Demand regime dropped starting Period_6 and has remained lower since; recent demand (Periods 14\u201333 and especially 6\u201333) is substantially below early-period peaks. To avoid overstocking from early high-demand samples, I bias the forecast toward recent data. I therefore keep L as default (use promised lead time = 0, which matches observed arrivals) and use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 20 demand samples \u2014 this captures the sustained lower-demand regime while still using a reasonably large recent window to smooth volatility. This balances service level (by reflecting current lower demand) against holding cost (avoiding inflation from early high-demand outliers).

=== Period 34 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=36, arrived=36 units (ordered on Period 34, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=53, demand=26, sold=26, ending on-hand inventory=27
Daily Profit: $104.00, Daily Holding Cost: $27.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $77.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 context: on-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical evidence (carry-over) confirms a sustained drop in demand starting Period 6 (avg \u224854.9 for Periods 6\u201322) and lead time has been consistently 0 (orders in Periods 1\u201334 arrived same period). Given the long-lived low-demand regime since Period 6 and ample history in that regime, I set L to the default (promised) 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent stable low-demand regime (regime length since Period 6 is >20), so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 demand samples. For volatility I also use recent_N N=20 so sigma_hat reflects recent variability. These choices keep target base-stock tuned to the lower demand regime (reducing overstock/holding cost) while preserving service by using recent variability to set safety stock.

Daily Profit: $136.00, Daily Holding Cost: $18.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $118.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 context: on-hand=18, in-transit=0. Profit $4 / unit vs holding $1 / unit-period implies service level target q = 4/(4+1)=0.8, so OR will aim for elevated fill but we must avoid excess stock given lower demand regime. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201335 arrivals all same-period). There is a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6: demand dropped ~59% vs Periods 1\u20135 and has persisted for many periods. To reflect the lower, stable-demand regime I use recent data only from the current low-demand regime. Regime length since Period 6 is large (\u224830 periods), so choose N=20 (per rules: N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). This gives mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 demand samples to anchor the base-stock to the reduced demand; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. Keeping L as default (promised lead time 0) is appropriate because concluded history consistently shows lead time 0. These choices reduce overstock risk while maintaining a higher service level appropriate to the profit/holding trade-off. With on-hand=18 and no in-transit, the backend will compute orders to raise pipeline+on-hand to the base_stock targeted for the low-demand regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. Context: chips(Regular) profit=$4, holding=$1. On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained lower regime since Period 6 (carry-over insight recorded earlier). Recent demands (Periods 32\u201336: 18,40,26,34,44) show a modest uptick/volatility relative to the long-run low regime. No shipments are currently overdue (in-transit=0). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded history consistently confirms same-period arrivals and no evidence of new delays. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent demand pattern (captures the small rebound/volatility seen in the last five periods). This keeps base stock responsive to recent demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1. Using recent_N for sigma_hat aligns safety stock to recent variance so the OR backend can properly size z* and the cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $168.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 decision. Context: chips(Regular) profit $4/unit, holding $1/unit/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u201337) show a sustained demand regime drop beginning Period 6 (documented in carry-over): earlier mean ~134.6 (P1\u20135) then lower sustained mean (~54.9) through Period 22 and subsequent lower demands thereafter. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (orders arriving same period) across concluded history. No recent lost shipments or lead-time increases observed. Given confirmed actual lead time = 0 and long-run lower demand regime, I choose conservative, simple defaults so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this leverages the full sample set while the backend's base-stock formulation will downweight safety stock via the profit/(profit+holding) service quantile. Using defaults avoids overreacting to short-term variability while honoring the confirmed lead-time=0 and long-run lower demand pattern. Reconcile: with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, the backend will compute orders to replenish to the base-stock using the default forecast and observed lead time.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. On-hand=93, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 periods consistently (Periods 1\u201338). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 6 (carry-over insight already recorded). Recent realized demand is variable but lower than the original early-period average; the last 5 demand samples (Periods 34\u201338 = 26, 34, 44, 62, 11) average ~35.4. Given confirmed same-period arrivals, use the promised/confirmed lead time (default). To keep the OR backend responsive to the recent lower-volatility regime while still capturing short-term variability, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (so (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples) and set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. This biases ordering toward current demand levels and reduces overstock risk given holding cost ($1) vs. profit ($4). No overdue shipments to reconcile (in-transit=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-38.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 context: confirmed lead time has been 0 periods historically (carry-over). Recent demand is from a lower-demand regime that began in Period 6 and has persisted through Period 39. Current on-hand=82, in-transit=0 so all coverage must come from on-hand plus any new order (arrives same period due to L=0). I see no overdue shipments. Because the demand regime drop at Period 6 is sustained (many periods) I base the forecast on the most recent data to capture the lower mean and current variability. Choices: L=default to reflect the confirmed same-period arrivals; mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to target the last 20 periods of demand (captures current lower-demand regime and smooths short noise); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent variability. This balances service level vs holding cost by sizing the base-stock around the contemporary mean and volatility rather than earlier high-demand samples, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service given same-period replenishment.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Historical concludes show lead time consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P40 all arrived same period). Recent demand regime has been the lower regime since Period 6 (carry-over). Current on-hand = 63, in-transit = 0. Given confirmed LT=0 and sustained low-demand regime, I use a short recent window to capture the current demand level and volatility rather than the much higher early-period mean. I choose recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand (Periods 36\u201340 demands = 44, 62, 11, 11, 19; recent mean \u2248 29.4, recent std \u2248 21.9) and set L to default (promised lead time, which matches observed 0). This keeps base-stock tied to current low-demand conditions, reducing overstock risk while preserving service given profit/holding tradeoff (profit $4, holding $1 implies moderate service target). The recent_N choice helps the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the most relevant regime and avoids inflating mu_hat with early-period high demand.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 context: on-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201341) and the provided carry-over note show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6: average demand dropped from ~134.6 (Periods 1\u20135) to ~54.9 (Periods 6\u201322) and remained lower thereafter. Recent realized demand in the most recent periods (e.g., Periods 36\u201341: demands 44,62,11,11,19,21) is well below the early-sample mean, so I will bias the forecast toward the recent low-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed previously), so use the default promised lead time. For demand forecast I select recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (regime length since Period 6 is large; per rules N = min(regime_length,20) => 20). This uses the mean of the last 20 demand observations across the review+lead period (1+L) to set mu_hat, reducing overstock risk from the early high-demand samples. For sigma_hat I also choose recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. With profit=$4 and holding=$1, the backend will compute a base-stock that balances service level vs holding cost; using recent data lowers target inventory to avoid excess holding cost given persistently lower demand. Current on-hand (42) already covers a couple periods of observed demand, and with no in-transit units there are no overdue shipments to reconcile.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Context: Profit $4 / unit vs Holding $1 / unit \u2192 q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 so OR backend will target a high service level. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent P1\u2192P42). Demand regime: carry-over notes show a sustained drop starting Period 6 (low-demand regime from P6 onward). Current inventory: on-hand = 22, in-transit = 0. Recent demand (many periods since P6) has been much lower than early-period levels, so using all-sample mean would overweight the early high-demand periods. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0, confirmed by arrivals). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent ~20 periods within the low-demand regime; N chosen by rule: N = min(regime_length,20) with regime_length >>20). This gives the OR engine a forecast tuned to the current low-demand regime and reduces excess base stock. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect current volatility (so safety stock scales to recent variability rather than early-period volatility). These choices help the backend balance the high service level implied by profit vs holding cost by shrinking mean demand and variability inputs to the low-demand regime, avoiding large unnecessary orders given our small on-hand and zero in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. Recent history and carry-over indicate actual lead time = 0 (confirmed arrivals P1\u2192P1 ... P43\u2192P43). Current on-hand=3, in-transit=0 so pipeline inventory is minimal \u2014 risk of stockout this period is real if demand continues. Historical demand dropped sharply starting Period 6 and has remained at a lower regime (carry-over: avg fell ~59% from early periods). I therefore: 1) Keep L = default to trust the promised lead time of 0 (supported by sustained evidence of same-period arrivals). 2) Forecast demand using a recent-window average to capture the post-change, low-demand regime rather than the early high-demand samples \u2014 this reduces unnecessary inventory and holding cost. I choose recent_N with N=20 (last 20 demand observations) for mu_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 20 periods, which reflects the sustained lower demand and avoids over-ordering driven by early-period high values. 3) Use recent_N with N=20 for sigma_hat so variability is estimated from the same recent window. This pairing (recent mean + recent volatility) helps the OR engine set a base_stock that balances the $4 profit per unit (favoring service) against the $1 holding cost (penalizing excess inventory). Given current very low on-hand, this will produce orders sized to cover expected short-term demand in the low-demand regime while avoiding large safety stocks anchored to obsolete high-demand history.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concludes (Periods 1\u201344) confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained same-period arrivals). Demand regime: large drop starting Period 6 (documented in carry-over). Recent demand since the regime change is much lower and more stable than early periods, with occasional spikes. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I set L to default (use promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current low-demand regime (use the most recent 20 periods within the sustained low-demand regime). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 so the backend gauges variability from the same recent window. These choices keep target base stock aligned to the lower, sustained demand and reduce overordering from early high-demand samples.

=== Period 45 Summary ===
chips(Regular): ordered=30, arrived=30 units (ordered on Period 45, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=43, demand=37, sold=37, ending on-hand inventory=6
Daily Profit: $148.00, Daily Holding Cost: $6.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. Context: profit $4/unit, holding $1/unit/period. On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical pattern: a sustained demand regime shift began at Period 6 with average demand dropping ~59% vs Periods 1\u20135; that low-demand regime has persisted through the current period. Recent demand (Periods 6\u201345) is the relevant regime for forecasting. There are no overdue or in-transit arrivals to account for. To keep service while minimizing holding cost in this long, low-demand regime, I use a recent-regime forecast that focuses on the most recent data. I select recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses the last 20 observed demands from the current low-demand regime) so the base-stock is sized to current lower demand and recent volatility. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0), consistent with confirmed lead-time observations. This setup reduces excess holding by reacting to the sustained lower-demand regime while preserving adequate safety stock based on recent variability.

Daily Profit: $44.00, Daily Holding Cost: $32.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47. Current on-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical 'conclude' messages consistently show orders arriving same period (lead_time = 0 confirmed across many periods), so use promised/default lead time. Demand experienced a sustained downshift starting Period_6 (carry-over note) \u2014 recent demand is materially lower than the initial 5-sample history. Because profit ($4) >> holding cost ($1) the OR backend will target a high service level (q\u22480.80). To avoid excessive inventory given the long low-demand regime, I base demand estimates on the most recent regime data. Therefore: L = default (use promised 0). For demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 demand observations from the low-demand regime, capped at 20 per rules). This reduces overstating mean demand from early high-demand periods while still providing enough data to estimate variability. These parameters steer the OR engine to a base stock suited to the lower sustained demand while respecting the high service target implied by profit/holding tradeoff.

chips(Regular): ordered=10, arrived=10 units (ordered on Period 47, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=42, demand=18, sold=18, ending on-hand inventory=24
Daily Profit: $72.00, Daily Holding Cost: $24.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201347 conclude all show arrived same period) and carry-over already recorded a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 6 (Periods 1\u20135 mean=134.6 \u2192 Periods 6\u201322 mean=54.9). Recent history (Periods 23\u201347) continues at a substantially lower demand level (many samples in the 20\u201340 range with occasional spikes). Given confirmed same-period arrivals, I keep L at the promised/default (0). For demand I down-weight the early high-demand samples and use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower, more relevant recent regime. I choose N=20 (the backend rule N = min(regime_length,20), and the recent low-demand regime is long), so mu_hat and sigma_hat will be computed from the last 20 demand samples scaled by (1+L). This reduces target base stock to avoid excess holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4 (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 implies relatively high service but still sensible to use recent lower mean). Using recent_N for sigma_hat keeps safety stock proportional to recent volatility rather than the inflated early-period variance. With on-hand=24 and no pipeline, these parameters will instruct the OR engine to order toward a base-stock appropriate for current low-demand regime and avoid overstock/holding cost while maintaining service.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. Recent context: on-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 6 (noted in carry-over): earlier high-demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) are not representative. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 (confirmed across many periods). No shipments are currently overdue (in-transit=0). Given the long, sustained low-demand regime (Periods 6\u201348), I bias forecasts to recent data only to avoid over-ordering from older high-demand samples. Therefore: L chosen as default (promised lead time 0, consistent with confirmed actual lead time). For demand level and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 (per rules: recent regime length >>20, so N=20 capped) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 20 demand samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 20 demand samples. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the persistent low-demand regime and reduces holding cost risk while maintaining service level appropriate to profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_50. Current on-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 for many periods. Demand experienced a sustained drop starting Period_6 (lower regime persists through Period_49). To avoid overstocking while preserving service, I keep L as the promised/observed 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the current low-demand regime (use most recent 20 periods of demand to compute (1+L)*mean). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=20) so the OR engine sizes safety stock to observed recent volatility rather than inflated historical variability from the earlier high-demand regime. This keeps base_stock and cap grounded in the current low-demand pattern and prevents excessive holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1 per unit.
