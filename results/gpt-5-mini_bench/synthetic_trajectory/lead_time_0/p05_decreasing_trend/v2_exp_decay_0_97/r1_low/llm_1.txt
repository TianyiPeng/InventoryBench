Recent realized data: Period 1 sold 175 but demand was at least 225 (we stocked 175 and stockout occurred), so observed true demand could be higher than units sold. Given the historical Period_2 sample (189) and the Period_1 stockout, a best single-period forecast for Period_2 demand is \u2248189 units. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: The Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived within Period 1 (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 0). This is a single observation; not yet sustained evidence to record as a permanent lead-time change. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Orders placed now (Period 2) should arrive in time for Period 2 demand if lead_time=0 (as observed once). e) Final order logic: Profit per sold unit = $1.00; holding cost = $1.00 per unit per period. Because holding cost equals one-period profit, excess ending inventory yields no net benefit (it erodes profit dollar-for-dollar).

The provided historical samples for this SKU suggest typical demand ~158\u2013189, so recent data indicate a mean around ~160\u2013170 for near-term forecasting. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 both arrived in the same period (Period 1 and Period 2 conclude messages show arrived = ordered), so actual observed lead time so far = 0 in both periods.

Because promised lead time = 0 and recent actual arrivals were same-period, an order placed now should arrive in Period 3 and be available to meet Period 3 demand.

Order logic: forecast near-term demand ~66 units (5-period avg) but the two most recent periods (86, 88) indicate potential upside; given symmetric profit vs holding cost, it's better to avoid overstock and instead accept some risk of a small stockout than to carry inventory that would erase profit.
