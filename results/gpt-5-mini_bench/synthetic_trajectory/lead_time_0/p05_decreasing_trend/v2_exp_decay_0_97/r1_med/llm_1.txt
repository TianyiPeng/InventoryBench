The 5-period average is 175.2 units; variability exists but no clear sustained shift. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0, but actual lead time is unknown and must be inferred from future 'conclude' messages. No concluded arrivals exist yet, and in-transit=0, so we cannot confirm any lead-time drift or lost orders. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. We must cover current-period demand (L+1 periods where L is promised 0 \u2192 cover 1 period). e) Final order logic: Forecast for Period_1 demand \u2248 175 units (5-period average). Given profit=$4/unit and holding=$1/unit/period, meeting demand is valuable (expected marginal profit >> holding cost). Because promised lead time=0, an order placed now can arrive during this period; however, actual lead time uncertainty exists but lacks evidence, so ordering to meet the expected current-period demand is the best balance between service and holding cost. Therefore place an order for 175 units.",

The Period 1 concluded message shows realized demand = 225 but sales were capped at 175 due to stockout, so true demand may be higher than the sample but we have only one high-censoring signal. c) Lead time & orders: Period 1 order (175) arrived within Period 1 and the conclude message reports lead_time = 0. This is one confirmed 0-LT observation, consistent with the supplier-promised 0 periods; no evidence of lost shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With actual lead_time = 0 observed, an order placed now will arrive during Period 2 and can satisfy Period 2 demand. e) Order logic: balancing expected sales value vs. holding cost: profit per sold unit = $4, holding cost per unit per period = $1. The baseline forecast for Period 2 demand is ~185\u2013190, but Period 1 censoring suggests occasional demand spikes up to ~225. To avoid another lost-sales penalty while keeping moderate leftover inventory (which costs $1/unit), I place an order to cover expected demand including a modest safety buffer. Therefore I order 200 units (arriving this period to serve Period 2 demand).",

Simple recent average = (225+159)/2 = 192 units for Period3. (There is older example data in instructions, but actual game history is authoritative.) c) Lead time vs missing orders: Orders placed in Period1 and Period2 both arrived in the same period (concluded messages show lead_time=0). This suggests actual lead time is 0 so an order placed now can arrive during Period3 to satisfy Period3 demand. However, only two observations exist\u2014insufficient (need 3+) to record a sustained lead-time insight. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 41, In-transit = 0. With expected demand ~192, on-hand covers 41, leaving a shortfall of ~151 units. e) Final order logic: With profit $4/unit and holding cost $1/unit/period, the cost of understock (lost $4 profit per unsold opportunity) exceeds the holding penalty ($1) per extra unit kept. Therefore we should order to meet expected demand rather than substantially undershoot. I will order the shortfall: 192 - 41 = 151 units (rounded to integer).

Decision logic: With lead time = 0, any order placed in Period 41 arrives in the same period and can immediately meet demand. Marginal profit per unit sold = $4; marginal holding cost only applies to ending inventory ($1/period) so units ordered to meet immediate demand are highly profitable. To avoid excess ending inventory (which reduces net reward by $1/unit), target expected demand for Period 41 rather than building buffer.

With profit = $4/unit and holding = $1/unit/period, missed sales are costly relative to holding, so favor stocking enough to meet expected demand while avoiding large leftover inventory.\n\nb) Demand regime analysis: Recent 10-period demand (P33\u2013P42) = [41,53,61,86,88,47,10,50,107,77]. Sample mean \u2248 62 units, sample SD \u2248 26.6 units. There is considerable variability and occasional spikes (e.g., 107 at P41) and deep troughs (10 at P39). A conservative target stock that balances stockout risk and holding cost is mean + 0.5*SD \u2248 75 units.\n\nc) Lead time & missing orders: Historical conclude messages (through Period 42) consistently show orders arriving same period; lead time remains confirmed as 0 periods (already recorded historically). No outstanding in-transit inventory and no evidence of lost shipments.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 8, in-transit = 0.

To reach the target on-hand position (~75) we should order ~67 units (75 - 8).\n\ne) Final order logic: Place an order of 67 units to bring expected available inventory to ~75. This reduces stockout risk given high profit per unit while keeping expected leftover (and holding cost) moderate. If demand is below forecast this period, leftover inventory incurs $1/unit holding cost; if demand is above forecast we capture $4/unit profit on additional sales, which justifies maintaining this safety buffer.",

With lead time = 0, an order now will arrive before demand is realized. Profit per unit sold = $4; holding cost = $1 per unit per period. Excess inventory reduces reward by $1 per unit held; stockouts forfeit $4 profit per missed sale.

That implies ordering 11 + 4 = 15 units. This balances service (avoid losing $4 profit) against holding cost ($1 per unit).
