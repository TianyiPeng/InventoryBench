Five-period average = 112.4 units/period. Recent two periods (129,130) are slightly above the long-run mean but sample is small. I treat baseline demand \u2248112 units/period. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0, but actual lead time is unknown (no concluded arrivals observed yet). Because actual lead time can be \u22650 and orders can be lost, I must keep some pipeline cover for at least the decision+arrival window. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so there is currently zero coverage for upcoming demand. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs. profit $4/unit, so excessive overstock is costly but stockouts also forgo high margin. e) Final order logic: I aim to cover current-period demand plus one additional period of demand as protection against a 1-period actual lead time or transit uncertainty. Using baseline demand \u2248112 units/period \u2192 target cover \u2248 2 \xd7 112 = 224 units. This balances service (avoid lost sales) versus holding cost given the high product margin.

The problem-provided sample series (112,111,80,129,130) suggests a higher baseline, but recent realized demand (2 periods) is substantially lower; with only two recent samples I weight recent observations more but remain cautious. c) Lead time & missing orders: From Period 1 conclude, an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=224, lead_time=0). No other arrivals occurred. There is no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=91, in-transit=0. If lead_time=0 (as observed in P1), any order placed now would arrive before demand in Period 3, but that arrival is only visible in Period 4 conclude. e) Final order logic: Expected demand for Period 3 is ~67 units.

Given profit per unit sold is $4 and holding cost is $1 per unit per period, carrying extra inventory into the next period without strong evidence of higher demand would incur holding costs and reduce objective.

This indicates demand has risen sharply in Period3; recent realized demand signal for Period3 is 136 (the reported demand), which is the best indicator of current peak demand. c) Lead time / orders: We have one confirmed conclude (Period1) showing an order with lead_time=0. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift; however this is only one sample so not a sustained pattern to record. Given supplier promised 0 and one confirmed 0, assume 0-period arrival (order will arrive within this same period). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no inventory to meet Period4 demand unless we order now. e) Final ordering logic: Because orders (if lead_time=0) arrive this period after the decision, we should order to cover expected Period4 demand. The most recent full demand signal is 136 (Period3). To avoid another stockout and lost sales, order equal to the most recent observed demand (136).

I computed demand from the most recent 10 concluded periods (Periods 32\u201341): [97,111,102,96,112,110,117,91,105,120].

Under a newsvendor framing, underage cost Cu = $4, overage cost Co = $1, giving critical ratio CR = 4/(4+1) = 0.8 (80th percentile).
