Product is a regular chips SKU (snack) with no obvious seasonal driver for this single-period decision.\n\nb) Demand regime analysis: Historical samples for chips(Regular) show recent demands: [112, 111, 80, 129, 130]. The 5-period average = 112.4 units. There is some variability (one lower sample at 80, two higher near 129-130) but no sustained regime change signaled.\n\nc) Lead-time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time = 0, but actual lead time is unknown. If actual lead_time = 0 the order will arrive during Period 1 and satisfy Period 1 demand; if actual lead_time >= 1 the order will not arrive in time for Period 1 demand. We have no concluded arrival history yet to update lead-time belief. Ordering exactly to expected period demand balances service and holding cost under this uncertainty.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. No overdue shipments.\n\ne) Final order logic: Expected demand for Period 1 \u2248 112 units. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit = $1/unit, so leftover ending inventory yields zero net incremental benefit (it cancels profit). Therefore avoid over-ordering above expected Period-1 demand to minimize holding cost risk. Place an order to cover ~112 units for Period 1 sales. This balances capturing expected sales if the promised 0 lead-time holds while avoiding excess inventory that would be costly to hold if arrivals are early or demand is lower.\n\nRisk note: If the actual lead time is >=1, this order will not arrive in time and Period 1 sales will be lost; we will learn lead-time behavior from future conclude messages and adjust future orders accordingly.",

These three periods give a simple recent-demand mean of (112+109+135)/3 = 118.7. External sample points provided in the problem statement (P4=129, P5=130) suggest demand may be drifting higher (\u2248129), but those are only two future-sample points and not part of the concluded history; I weight the confirmed concluded data more heavily. c) Lead time / orders: Observed arrivals show orders placed in P1, P2, P3 arrived the same period (arrived=ordered in each conclude) \u2014 actual lead time is 0 periods. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0.

No sustained shift (needs 3+ periods). c) Lead time / pipeline: Carry-over insight from Period 4 confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods; recent history consistently shows same-period arrivals.
