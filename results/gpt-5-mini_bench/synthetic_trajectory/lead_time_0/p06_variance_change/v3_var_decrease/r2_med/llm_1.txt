With no in-transit inventory and no prior concludes, I cannot confirm any lead-time deviations. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so all expected demand must be covered by a new order if arrivals occur same-period; if actual lead time >0 the order placed now will not arrive in time. Because lead time is unconfirmed, I balance risk by planning for the immediate (one-period) demand rather than stocking extra safety inventory that would incur holding cost. e) Final order logic: target the expected Period_1 demand (58 units) to maximize expected profit while avoiding unnecessary holding cost.

The most relevant recent observed true demand is Period_2 = 163. Period_1 sales were limited by stock (only 58 sold vs demand 145), so realized sales understate demand. c) Lead time / orders: Period_1 conclude shows an order placed in Period_1 arrived in Period_1 with lead_time = 0 periods.

Promised lead time = 0 and we have one confirmed 0-period arrival; since arrivals occur same period ordered, an order placed now will arrive in this period (but you only observe its conclusion next period). e) Final order logic: We must cover current-period demand (L+1 = 1 period) because arrivals happen after ordering but lead time=0 implies arrival during this period. To maximize reward, fill expected demand for Period_2 (163 units) while avoiding excess inventory (holding cost $1/unit/period reduces objective).

There is no 3+ period sustained new regime since Period 10: the sequence includes both low and high spikes, so treat demand as uncertain but centered below the early high regime. c) Lead-time & arrivals: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 periods (orders have arrived same period for multiple periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order now will arrive in Period 14 before demand. d) Inventory/pipeline: because lead time = 0 and we start with zero stock, all demand must be supplied from the order placed now. e) Ordering logic: apply newsvendor logic. Profit per sold unit = $4, holding cost per leftover unit = $1 \u2192 critical fractile = Cu/(Cu+Co) = 4/(4+1) = 0.8. Estimate the 80th percentile from recent seven-period sample (sorted [11,20,23,74,109,116,168]) \u2192 empirical 80th percentile \u2248 147 units. Ordering ~147 units balances expected lost-margin vs holding cost under current uncertainty. Because arrivals are same-period, this order maximizes expected reward given the asymmetric costs (lost profit > holding cost).",

On-hand 104 likely covers a moderate demand but may be insufficient for spike scenarios.

Recent realized demands (P37\u2013P41) = 89,100,76,103,79 \u2014 consistent with the ~98 baseline but with volatility. I therefore use ~98 units as the next-period demand forecast (conservative central estimate).\n\nc) Lead time vs. missing orders: Concluded history repeatedly shows orders arriving in the same period they were placed (lead_time observed = 0 in multiple periods). No missing or delayed shipments are evident. Treat supplier as same-period (0) lead time.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 16, In-transit = 0. With confirmed lead_time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during Period 42 before demand is realized. The system guidance requires covering (L+1)=1 period of demand when placing orders now. Forecast demand for the upcoming period \u224898 units, so required on-hand to meet expected sales \u224898.\n\ne) Final order logic: Required order = forecast demand (98) \u2212 current on-hand (16) = 82 units. Holding cost is $1/unit/period while profit on a sale is $4/unit; ordering to meet expected demand is profitable (expected marginal profit >> holding cost). I avoid substantial extra safety stock to limit holding cost because lead time is zero and demand volatility is moderate. Therefore place an order for 82 units (will arrive this period and be available for sales).",

Recent realized demand (Periods 37\u201342 = 89,100,76,103,79,86) averages 88.8 units \u2014 slightly below the 98.3 baseline but consistent with the lower post-30 regime.

With lead time = 0, we can place an order that arrives this same period (and will be visible in the conclude message for this period). Holding cost = $1/unit/period is high relative to profit $4/unit; therefore excess inventory held across multiple periods erodes margin. Because we can reorder every period, we should avoid carrying multi-period safety stock.\n(e) Final order logic: Forecast current-period demand \u2248 89 units (recent 6-period average). To meet expected demand while minimizing holding cost, order enough to bring available inventory up to the forecast for this period: order = max(0, forecast - on-hand) = 89 - 12 = 77 units. This matches replenishing to expected period demand without building extra multi-period stock. If realized demand is higher, we can order again next period due to 0 lead time.
