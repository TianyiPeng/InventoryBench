There is some variability (range 74\u2013135) but no sustained shift or trend yet. c) Lead time / arrivals: supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unknown and must be inferred from future conclude messages. With no in-transit or prior arrivals to infer delays/losses, assume optimistic same-period arrival is possible but not certain. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so only a new order can satisfy Period 1 demand. Holding cost=$1/unit/period vs profit=$4/unit sold implies strong incentive to satisfy demand but avoid excess inventory because unsold units cost a full $1 each in addition to tying up capital. e) Final order logic: forecast for the current period \u2248106 units (historical mean). To balance service level and holding cost given uncertain lead time, place an order sized to meet expected Period 1 demand only (not carry extra for future periods). This minimizes expected lost sales while avoiding unnecessary holding cost until we can observe actual lead time and updated demand. Order quantity chosen: 106 units.",

For Period 2 specifically the sample demand is 74. In-game observation: Period 1 actual demand = 130 but we were stock-limited and sold 106; that single-period high is not yet a confirmed regime shift. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Period 1 order (106) arrived in Period 1 and conclude message shows lead_time = 0 for that shipment. This is only one observation \u2014 not yet a sustained change. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With supplier behaving as 0 lead time in the only observed shipment, an order placed now should arrive within the same period and be available to meet Period 2 demand (arrivals will be confirmed in the Period 2 conclude message). e) Final order logic: Use a risk-aware order to balance lost-sales profit ($4/unit) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period).

Recent actual concludes show sold: P1 sold 106 (stockout), P2 sold 90 (stockout), P3 sold 105 (no stockout).

Short-run demand is moderate with some variability.\n\nc) Lead time vs. missing orders: Concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u20133 show orders arrived same period (arrived=ordered and lead_time was 0).

Treat actual lead time as 0 periods (confirmed by P1\u2013P3 evidence).\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 32, In-transit = 0.

To avoid expected leftover (which incurs $1/unit holding cost) and to maximize profit ($4/unit sold), order enough so on-hand + order \u2248 demand forecast. Required order = 110 - 42 = 68 units. This balances service level against holding cost given current uncertainty. If demand ends up lower, leftover units incur holding cost $1/unit; if demand is higher, missed units forego $4/unit profit \u2014 the forecasted target uses recent 10-period average to balance these trade-offs.",

Inventory & cost trade-offs: profit = $4 per unit sold, holding cost = $1 per unit for ending inventory. This implies it is favorable to stock units that are likely to sell because profit per sale net of one-period holding (if leftover) could still be positive if sold later, but holding cost penalizes overstock. Given high demand variability and zero lead time, it is optimal to order to cover a moderate-to-high demand forecast to avoid lost high-margin sales while accepting some holding risk.
