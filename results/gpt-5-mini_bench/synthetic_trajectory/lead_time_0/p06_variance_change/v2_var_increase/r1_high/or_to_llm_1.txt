My calculation using the same demand stats and the critical fractile implied by Profit=$19 and Holding=$1 (q=19/20=0.95 \u2192 z*=1.645) indicates ordering ~98 units to reach the target base-stock of ~150 units. Since lead time is confirmed 0, orders arrive in time to meet current-period demand; increasing OR's 93 to 98 brings us to the theoretically optimal base-stock and slightly reduces stockout risk given the high profit per unit (large penalty for missed sales relative to holding cost).\n\nInventory policy decision: Order 98 units now so arrivals add to on-hand for Period 2 demand. This targets the OR-derived base-stock and balances expected demand (~106 units) with safety stock driven by the high profit/low holding cost ratio.\n\nRisk notes: If demand is persistently lower in coming periods, this order will increase ending inventory and holding cost.

Period 4 carry-over already recorded this as a confirmed change, so I treat actual lead time as 0 (same-period arrivals). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so nothing will be available for Period 5 demand unless I order now. Demand analysis: historical samples [132, 74, 101, 90, 135] give empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 = 106.4 units and sample std dev \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 26.56. With confirmed lead time L=0, the review+lead demand \u03bc\u0302 = 106.4 and \u03c3\u0302 = 26.56. OR baseline: OR recommends 137 units (capped base-stock). OR uses promised L and full history; it's a reasonable starting point but slightly lower than the analytically derived base-stock here. My analytic base-stock (using the OR method) uses critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/20 = 0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645.

The OR cap equals the same value when L=0, so the uncapped and capped calculations coincide, explaining why my derived value is ~150 (OR's numerical implementation yielded 137). Decision tradeoffs: lead time=0 means ordered units arrive in time for Period 5 demand, so no need to carry extra pipeline. Holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so we favor higher service level to avoid lost sales. Recent periods include two high-demand observations (132 and 135) and one stockout in Period 4 (demand 83 with ending on-hand 0), which supports keeping safety stock. Final strategy: order 150 units to set on-hand+arrivals near the analytically justified base-stock (~150) to cover expected Period 5 demand (mean 106.4) plus safety stock for a 95% service level. This is a modest increase vs OR's 137 recommendation and is justified by (a) confirmed zero lead time allowing same-period fulfillment, (b) recent high-demand samples, and (c) low holding cost relative to profit. If future concluded periods show lower realized demand for several periods in a row (3+), I will reduce the base-stock accordingly.",

There is no in-transit inventory and no evidence of lost shipments.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate from recent observed data: Use concluded demands (P1\u2013P5 = 99, 63, 66, 83, 65).

There are no in-transit units now.\n2) Inventory position: On-hand = 3, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, any order placed now arrives within the same period and can satisfy Period 7 demand.\n3) Demand outlook: Historical samples (given earlier) have mean \u2248106.4 over the five-sample set; recent observed demands (Periods 4\u20136: 83, 65, 99) suggest a one-period demand typically in the ~80\u2013100 range. The OR baseline recommends 130 (it uses promised lead time and older stats). OR's policy uses a high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95 \u2192 z\u22481.645) which inflates safety stock; with lead time 0 that produces a larger same-period order than needed.\n4) Trade-off and holding cost: Profit per unit ($19) greatly exceeds holding cost ($1), so understocking is costly. However, ordering up to OR's 130 would likely leave large ending inventory given expected demand ~100, incurring extra holding cost unnecessarily.\n5) Action decision: Target a stocking level around the single-period expected demand (~105 units) rather than OR's 130 cap. With on-hand=3, order = 105 \u2212 3 = 102 would reach target available stock of 105 this period. To be slightly conservative given demand variability and high profit, I round to 105 units ordered (arrives same period), which yields available inventory 108 (3+105) to meet demand and modest safety stock without excessive holding cost.\n6) How this adapts OR: I reduce OR's recommendation from 130 to 105 because actual lead time=0 (so L+1=1), recent demand evidence centers below OR's cap-driven quantity, and we want to avoid unnecessary holding costs while still protecting against stockouts.\n7) Risk note: If demand spikes above ~108 this period we may stock out; but given the recent sequence and confirmed lead time=0, this is an acceptable trade-off to reduce holding penalties.\n",

{
  "rationale": "Summary of observations and inference:\n- Lead time: Concluded history (Periods 1-7) shows every order arriving same period it was placed (arrived=ordered on same Period). Promised lead time = 0 and actual lead time = 0 is confirmed. Therefore an order placed now (Period 8 decision) will arrive during Period 8 and be available for Period 8 demand.\n- Inventory state: On-hand = 2, In-transit = 0. Effectively available inventory before ordering is 2 units; this is insufficient for typical single-period demand.\n- Demand pattern: Recent realized demands (Periods 1\u20137): 99, 63, 66, 83, 65, 99, 106. The most recent three periods (P5\u2013P7) average 90 units vs earlier P1\u2013P4 average ~77.8 (+~16%), indicating demand has edged upward but with variability. Overall 7-period average \u224883 units/period.\n- OR recommendation: OR baseline (capped base-stock) recommends 131 units. OR uses promised L (0) and historical samples; it produces a relatively high target because profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), so it biases toward higher safety stock.\n- Profit/holding tradeoff: Profit per unit is high relative to holding cost, so stocking more to avoid lost sales is generally optimal. With lead time=0, ordered units can be used immediately, so there is little pipeline risk. Holding cost is only $1 per unit for any ending inventory.\nDecision and quantity:\n- I accept the OR recommendation of 131 units. Rationale: On-hand is only 2 units and recent demand is frequently near or above 90 units; ordering up to OR's base-stock of 131 gives strong protection against stockouts (high forgone-profit cost) while incurring modest holding cost. Because lead time is confirmed 0, this order will meet Period 8 demand immediately. With profit = $19 per unit, the expected marginal benefit of avoiding stockouts exceeds the marginal holding cost for additional safety stock embedded in OR's target.\n- Operationally: order = 131 (arrives during Period 8, available for Period 8 demand). This aligns with OR but is justified by confirmed lead time=0, low on-hand, recent upward demand signal, and favorable profit/holding ratio.\nSensitivity notes (for future periods): If future concludes show demand falling for 3+ sustained periods or shipments lost/delayed, I will revise downward. If holding costs or profit change, re-evaluate tradeoff.",

OR recommendation (capped policy) is 149 units, which uses historical averages and the promised lead time but cannot account for the latest large spike. Decision logic: profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1/unit/period), so the cost of a modest overstock is low compared to lost profit from unmet demand.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & pipeline: Concluded history shows lead time = 0 (confirmed in Period 4 and every conclude since). There is currently on-hand=32 and in-transit=0; any order placed now will arrive during this same period (and be visible in the conclude message next period).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand analysis: Recent realized demand has risen versus the earliest periods. Last 5 period demands (P5\u2013P9) = 65, 99, 106, 165, 133 \u2192 average = 113.6 units. The OR baseline recommends 120 units based on its capped base-stock calculation (which uses historical data and promised lead time). Given the most recent two periods (P8=165, P9=133) are well above the earlier regime, the short-run expected demand is closer to ~110\u2013120 units.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Profit/holding tradeoff: Profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1 per period \u2192 critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95, so policy favors stocking to avoid stockouts. Holding cost is small relative to profit, so being slightly long is acceptable to capture sales.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision logic: With lead time = 0 we can top up immediately to meet this period's demand. On-hand is 32; if expected demand is \u2248114, we need about 82 more units just to meet expected sales. To protect against the observed variability (recent high demands up to 165) and align with OR's conservative recommendation, I increase OR's 120 slightly to provide additional safety stock for intra-period demand variability.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final action: Order 140 units. This brings available inventory during this period to 172 (32 + 140), which covers historically observed peaks (P8=165) and reduces chance of stockout while incurring modest holding cost. This adjustment is a small upward tweak to OR's 120 reflecting confirmed lead time=0 and recent elevated demand.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk notes & monitoring: If the next few periods show demand reverting down (3+ periods of lower demand), I will retract and reduce future orders. Conversely, if elevated demand persists, maintain or increase order size. No new sustained pattern meets the 3+ period threshold beyond what is already recorded in carry-over insights.",

Period 11 (Period_11) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201310) repeatedly shows orders arriving in the same period they were placed (arrived=ordered on same period). The supplied carry-over already confirmed lead time = 0 at Period 4; subsequent periods (5\u201310) continue to show same-period arrivals, so I treat actual lead time as 0. This means an order placed now will arrive in Period 11 and can be used to meet Period 11 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: Recent demand is materially higher than the early baseline. Periods 1\u20134 average = 77.75 units. Periods 5\u201310 demand series = [65,99,106,165,133,114] has mean \u2248 113.7 and sample std dev \u2248 33.6. This is a sustained elevation (6 consecutive periods) compared with the Periods 1\u20134 baseline, so I treat the current demand regime as higher.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 93 units. OR uses historical data and promised lead time; it does not incorporate the confirmed lead-time=0 and the clear recent upward shift in demand mean and volatility. Given the profit/holding cost ratio (profit $19, holding $1), the critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645, which implies substantial safety stock is appropriate to avoid expensive stockouts.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Inventory math and final order: With lead time 0 the appropriate base-stock for one-period demand is base_stock = \u03bc + z*\u03c3 \u2248 113.7 + 1.645\xd733.6 \u2248 169 units. Current available pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) = 58 + 0 = 58 units. Order_raw = base_stock \u2212 pipeline = 169 \u2212 58 \u2248 111 units. OR's 93 is below the recent mean demand and would leave higher stockout risk given high profit; therefore I increase OR's recommendation to 111 units. This raises on-hand + arrival to roughly the base-stock level (\u2248169) which balances the high stockout cost (lost profit) versus modest holding cost ($1/unit/period).\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk notes & conservatism: The demand shift is sustained across 6 periods, so increasing the order is justified. Because holding cost is small relative to profit, erring on the side of more inventory is appropriate. If next periods show demand dropping back, we will reduce orders accordingly.\n\nAction summary: Place order of 111 units for chips(Regular) to bring expected available inventory up to a safety-stock-inclusive base level for the newly observed higher-demand regime.",

Historical demand (Periods 1\u201311) mean \u2248 98.7, but there is a sustained higher-demand regime from Period 5 onward (carry-over insight): recent periods 6\u201311 have mean \u2248 118.3 with high variability (spikes of 165 and 133). Profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), so the cost of a stockout is far greater than the cost of extra inventory. OR recommended 73 units (baseline capped policy). That recommendation is reasonable, but given the confirmed higher recent demand regime and the high profit margin, I will tilt slightly more toward service (add safety). Target single-period coverage using recent mean \u2248118 and an added safety buffer consistent with a high critical fractile (z\u22481.645) and observed variability suggests a target on-hand \u2248159 units for this period.

Use L=0 for planning.\n- Inventory state: On-hand = 107, In-transit = 0. Because L=0, any order placed now would arrive during this same period's arrival resolution (but you will only see confirmation at period conclude); however the customer demand for this period occurs after decision and will be satisfied from current on-hand + same-period arrivals.\n- Recent demand signal: Recent realized single-period demands (Periods 12\u201318) = [134,119,111,66,115,118,42], 7-period mean \u2248 100.7. The longer-run higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u201310 mean \u2248113.7) was recorded previously in carry-over insights. The last period (42) is an outlier relative to the recent cluster around ~110; there is no new sustained shift (need \u22653 periods consistent) so do not treat the dip as permanent.\n- OR recommendation: OR recommends ordering 43 units. OR's critical fractile uses profit/(profit+holding)=19/20=0.95 leading to a high safety factor (z\u22481.645). OR uses historical samples and promised lead time; with L=0 it calculates a base-stock that can push order sizes up to cap. OR cannot account for current on-hand or recent regime nuances beyond its pipeline calculation.\n- Decision logic: With L=0 we need to ensure on-hand + order covers expected single-period demand (L+1 = 1 period). Expected demand \u2248 100\u2013114 depending on window; current on-hand = 107 which already exceeds the recent 7-period mean (~100.7) and is close to the longer-run regime mean (~113.7). Ordering the OR-recommended 43 would raise on-hand to 150 and incur additional holding cost ($1 per unit per period) unnecessarily while providing limited incremental stockout protection because lead time is zero and we already have adequate on-hand coverage for one period. Given high profit, OR is conservative, but holding cost penalizes excess inventory and we should avoid overstocking when on-hand already covers expected demand.\n- Final strategy: Place no order this period (order = 0). Rationale: on-hand (107) is sufficient to cover expected single-period demand (\u2248101\u2013114) given L=0; the recent low demand (42) appears transient, not a sustained regime change. Avoid the holding cost of extra inventory while retaining coverage for this period. Continue monitoring demand next periods; if a sustained upward shift (\u22653 periods) reappears, increase orders accordingly.\n- Risk notes: If demand unexpectedly spikes above ~107 this period, we will incur a stockout and lost sales; however the historical regime and recent average do not strongly justify immediate replenishment given holding cost trade-off.\n",

This confirms the earlier carry-over insight (Lead time = 0).\n\n2) Inventory & recent demand: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so we have no coverage for today's demand unless we order now. Recent realized demands are volatile: Periods 16\u201320 demands = 115, 118, 42, 76, 150 (mean \u2248 100.2, wide spread). Period 20 demand was 150 and the machine stocked out (starting on-hand 101, sold 101), indicating potential for large single-period demand spikes. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) while profit per unit is high ($19), so the critical fractile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 implies we should target a high service level.\n\n3) OR recommendation comparison: OR (capped base-stock) recommends 153 units. OR uses the promised lead time and historical samples; because actual lead time = 0, OR's recommendation is directly actionable for this period. The OR cap and base-stock reflect a high safety factor (\u03a6\u22121(0.95)\u22481.645) appropriate given the profit/holding ratio.\n\n4) Decision logic: Given zero on-hand, confirmed 0 lead time (so immediate arrival), recent large spike (Period 20 = 150) and OR's recommendation of 153 which aligns with the high critical-fractile, I will follow OR's recommendation and order 153 units. This balances risk of another large demand spike (avoiding lost sales which for this product is expensive) against the small carrying cost.\n\n5) Risk notes: If several future periods show a sustained drop in demand (3+ periods), I would reduce future orders.

Decision logic: With lead time = 0, ordering 113 will arrive this period and bring available inventory to 152 (39 + 113), which covers the elevated expected demand (~114) plus safety stock consistent with the high critical fractile; this balances maximizing profit from sales vs modest holding cost.

I therefore accept actual lead time = 0. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 111, In-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, any order placed now would arrive within the same period's arrival resolution (but remember arrivals are only visible in the conclude message next period) \u2014 however the operational effect is that we can satisfy current-period demand only from current on-hand plus any arrival from an order placed now (but since arrivals occur during the period after decision, they do come into the starting inventory for demand in this same period given L=0). Demand outlook: Historical demand has increased compared with early periods (carry-over insights note sustained higher mean since Period 5), recent demands are variable: last five demands = 42,76,150,114,41 (Periods 18\u201322) and the longer-run recent average (Periods 5\u201310 and later) clusters around ~114 in the mid-run, but volatility is high. OR recommended 42 units (uses promised L and historical samples). Decision logic vs OR: Given the high profit (19) relative to holding cost (1), the OR policy has a high service target (q=0.95) and would normally order to keep stock high, but we must weigh current on-hand. With on-hand 111 and L=0, we already have enough inventory to cover a single-period demand around the recent single-period mean (~100\u2013115). The single largest recent single-period demand was 150 (Period 20), which would exceed current on-hand if it occurred again; however such extreme spikes are intermittent and not sustained; ordering to cover rare peaks would incur ongoing holding cost for leftover units. The OR's cap (42) would increase on-hand to 153, which matches some prior restocking levels, but that would raise holding cost unnecessarily given current 111. Action: I choose to order 0 units this period to avoid additional holding cost while retaining adequate coverage for expected demand.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history shows every past order arrived in the same period it was ordered (P1 arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, ... P24 arrived P24). Lead time is confirmed as 0 periods, so any order placed now will arrive during Period 25 (after my decision) and be available for Period 25 demand. There are no in-transit units (in-transit=0) and on-hand=2, so almost all demand for Period 25 must be supplied by a new order.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: Recent demand is volatile but has repeated large spikes (Period 20 sold out on 101/150 demand, Period 24 demand=150 and sold fully, Periods 21 and 24 show 114 and 150; Periods 22\u201323 were low at 41 and 56). Given the high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), the service-level critical fractile is high (q\u224819/20=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645), so it is optimal to carry safety stock to avoid stockouts when demand spikes.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 153 units using its base-stock capped policy. OR uses promised lead time (which matches observed lead time=0) and historical demand; its policy is already calibrated for a high service level given profit/holding costs. With on-hand=2 and no pipeline, OR's order would supply Period 25 demand and build a modest buffer.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision and justification: I follow the OR recommendation of 153 units. Rationale: confirmed lead time=0 means the OR assumption about timing is correct; recent observed demand includes multiple 150-unit spikes, so ordering ~153 units (instead of a much lower mean-based order) reduces costly lost sales given high unit profit and low holding cost. Ordering 153 keeps stock to meet a potential large demand surge this period while not incurring excessive holding cost.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Operational notes: Because lead time is 0, we should continue to monitor arrivals in conclude messages each period; if demand shows a sustained new regime (3+ periods) I'll record a carry-over insight and adjust ordering policy.

Recent demand (Periods 21\u201325) = [114, 41, 56, 150, 83]; mean \u2248 88.8 units. A short-window recent mean is most relevant because demand has shown regime shifts in earlier periods; the last 5 periods give the best current signal.

With lead time = 0 we only need to cover the upcoming single-period demand (L+1 = 1).

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 107, in-transit = 0.

With L=0 we need to cover only the current-period demand at decision time (L+1 = 1 period). A conservative target is to hold roughly the recent sustained mean \u2248114 plus a small safety buffer for demand volatility; that implies target on-hand \u2248 120 units. OR recommended 57 units (it uses promised L, historical samples and caps), but that recommendation ignores current on-hand (107) and the sustained elevated demand regime. Ordering the full OR recommendation would overstock relative to current pipeline and also seems unnecessary because on-hand already covers most expected demand. Final strategy: top up to a target on-hand of ~120 to cover a likely single-period demand spike without incurring excessive holding cost. That means ordering 13 units (120 \u2212 107 = 13). This keeps service high given recent demand increases while minimizing holding penalties.

This action balances the confirmed higher-demand regime with inventory carrying cost.

Therefore actual lead time = 0 periods and orders placed now will arrive within the same period's arrival resolution and can be used to satisfy current-period demand. There are no in-transit units and on-hand = 0. \n\n2) Demand outlook: Recent realized demands remain elevated relative to the very early periods. The long-run sustained regime shift was already recorded (Periods 5\u201310 mean \u2248113.7) and more recent periods 31\u201337 show mixed but still substantial demand (92,135,115,52,55,113,137 \u2192 mean \u2248100, high variance). Given the historically confirmed higher-demand regime and volatile single-period peaks (up to 188 earlier), planning for ~100+ units is prudent. \n\n3) OR recommendation review: OR suggests 162 units using promised L and historical samples; because L=0 in reality, the OR baseline's heavy safety stock due to a high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95 \u2192 z\u22481.645) is reasonable. Profit per unit is large relative to holding cost, so the penalty for understock (lost high-margin sales) is much higher than holding expense for extra units. \n\n4) Inventory decision: On-hand=0 and no pipeline, so to avoid a costly stockout this period we should bring inventory in this period. With actual lead time 0 the ordered units will be available for demand this period. Given high unit profit, low holding cost, confirmed higher-demand regime, and OR's statistically derived cap already smoothing swings, I will follow the OR recommendation of 162 units. This balances avoiding lost sales on likely ~100+ demand while accepting small expected holding cost if demand is below the order.\n\n5) Risk notes & monitoring: There is substantial demand variance\u2014if several low-demand periods persist, we should scale back. Conversely, if more frequent >150 peaks reappear, we may even increase.

Recent realized demands show high variability with several large peaks (notably demand \u2248137 in Period 37 and 188 in Period 29 historically). OR recommends 61 units using its capped base-stock approach; OR assumes promised lead time and historical demand. Given the confirmed L=0, an order immediately increases available inventory for the current-period demand. Cost balance: profit $19 >> holding cost $1, so stockouts are far more expensive than holding extra units; keeping a buffer to cover recent observed peaks is appropriate. Decision logic: I want total available inventory (on-hand + this order) to comfortably cover the highest recent peak demand (Period 37 demand = 137). With on-hand = 100, ordering 40 raises immediate availability to 140, slightly above that peak. This is more conservative than using OR's 61 only if on-hand were low; but since we already have 100 on-hand, we don't need the full OR order to hit the same protection level. I therefore order 40 units to reach ~140 available units. This balances minimizing holding cost while protecting against costly stockouts given the observed high peaks and low lead time.

Given recent elevated demand and confirmed zero lead time, OR\u2019s 100 would leave total available \u2248 170 (70 on-hand + 100 ordered) which is below the 95%-service base-stock target (~195) and risks stockouts on high-demand days.\n\nFinal decision logic: Because profit per unit is large relative to holding cost, the penalty for understocking (lost profit) is much larger than the modest holding cost. I therefore top up toward the higher target but stop short of the absolute target to limit excess inventory given observed volatility. Ordering 125 units raises available inventory to 195 (70 + 125), matching the conservative service-level target (\u2248195) and should capture demand on most high-demand days while keeping holding costs modest.\n\nAction summary: Order 125 units now (arrives same period) so Period 45 starting available inventory will be ~195.\n",

Earlier carry-over insights already recorded a sustained upward shift in demand vs Periods 1\u20134.\n- OR recommendation: 132 units. OR uses the promised L=0 and historical demand to compute a base-stock/capped order; its recommendation aligns with the recent 10-period mean (~131) and includes a safety margin via the cap.\nDecision logic and final strategy:\n- With L=0 we must cover (L+1)=1 period of demand after ordering. That means order + on-hand should cover the next period's demand distribution. On-hand (39) + OR order (132) \u2192 171 units available, which comfortably exceeds the ~131 expected demand and gives buffer for variability.\n- Profit per unit ($19) far exceeds holding cost ($1/period), so it is preferable to avoid lost sales by keeping enough stock rather than aggressively cutting orders to minimize holding. Given only 5 periods left in the game horizon, overstock risk is limited and potential sales upside is large.\n- The OR recommendation already reflects historical variance and a capped smoothing; recent realized mean closely matches OR's suggestion.

Recent realized demands are volatile (examples: P41=186, P42=90, P43=124, P44=101, P45=156, P46=24) but the one-period-ahead need cannot exceed on-hand of 147 in any plausible scenario. Profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1/unit/period (very low relative to profit), so the OR base-stock policy aims for high service. OR recommends 25 units (cap adjusted) based on historical demand and promised lead time.\n\nDecision logic / adjustment: With lead time = 0 and ample on-hand (147) covering expected single-period demand, ordering additional units now only increases ending inventory and therefore holding-cost drag without materially increasing sales this period. Since we maximize Profit*units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost*ending_inventory, and there is no evidence of an imminent sustained demand spike that would deplete the large on-hand before arrival visibility, I choose to order 0 units and use existing inventory to meet demand.

Adjustment reasoning: With lead time = 0 we can replenish each period and do not need to pre-build pipeline inventory for future lead-time delays. Also we are near the horizon (Period 48 of 50) so over-ordering now would incur holding costs across the remaining short horizon; holding cost is $1/unit/period but profit per sold unit is $19, so stockouts are costly but we can replenish next periods if needed.

These are noisy but centered around ~102 over the last 5 periods; longer-run history shows many high-demand periods (several >150).
