  "rationale": "a) World/calendar/product: No calendar date beyond 'Period_1' and no special event flagged. Product is a regular chips SKU (snack) with no explicit seasonality provided. b) Demand regime analysis: Historical demand samples for this SKU are: P1=100, P2=69, P3=92, P4=77, P5=111. The five-period mean is ~90 units/period with observed single-periods ranging ~69\u2013111, so demand is moderately variable. c) Lead-time / missing orders: Promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time is unknown; there is no conclude history yet to confirm deliveries. Because actual lead time may be \u22651 or shipments may be delayed/lost, I must plan for at least (L+1) periods of demand where L is uncertain. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. There are no incoming arrivals visible. e) Final order logic: To maintain service and protect against a 1-period actual lead time, I target coverage for 2 periods of demand. Using the 5-period mean (~90 units/period) => target = 90 \xd7 2 = 180 units. This balances the profit per unit ($4) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) while providing reasonable safety given demand variability and unknown lead time. If future conclude messages show shorter/longer lead time or consistent demand regime shifts, I will adjust orders accordingly.",

Observed Period 1 actual demand = 89 (sold). That aligns with the historical mean (~90). Period-to-period variance exists but no sustained shift is observed.\n\nc) Lead_time vs. missing orders: Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in Period 1 (180) arrived in Period 1 with lead_time = 0 periods. This confirms at least one observation of same-period (0) lead time, but per carry-over rules we require sustained evidence (3+ periods) before recording a persistent lead-time insight.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: Current on-hand = 91, in-transit = 0. Expected demand for this period is ~90 (based on historical mean and Period 1 sale of 89). With a supplier lead time of 0 observed, any order placed now would arrive before demand, but we already hold ~91 units which is sufficient to meet expected demand.\n\ne) Final order logic: Ordering additional units would increase holding cost ($1/unit) and risks leftover inventory without proportionally increasing sales (marginal profit $4 only realized if sold).
