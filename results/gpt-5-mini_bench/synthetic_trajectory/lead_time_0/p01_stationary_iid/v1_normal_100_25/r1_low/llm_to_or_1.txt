Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1: no concluded history yet, on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we have no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time deviation. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean \u2248 89.8 units and modest variability. Promised lead time is 0 and there is no concluded arrival history to contradict it, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this gives a neutral baseline forecast that balances service level and holding cost given equal unit profit and holding cost. This approach is conservative until we observe arrivals/conclude messages that would indicate lead-time changes or a demand regime shift.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. History: Period_1 conclude shows an order placed in Period_1 arrived in Period_1 (arrived=90, ordered on Period_1, lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Demand history samples (environment): Periods 1-5: 100,69,92,77,111; observed Period_1 demand in game history was 108 (sold 90 due to stockout). No multi-period regime shift or persistent delay evident (only one concluded lead-time observation). Promised lead time is 0 and the single observed lead time confirms same-period arrivals. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0 each) implying an intermediate service-level tradeoff; using default data-driven estimates lets the OR engine compute base-stock from the full sample mean and std. Therefore: use default lead time (promised 0), default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps parameters conservative given limited evidence, avoids overreacting to a single shortfall, and balances service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Recent concluded history shows strong fulfilled demand: Period_1 demand=108 (sold 90 due to inventory), Period_2 demand=124 (sold 93). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so no arrivals pending and no overdue shipments. Both concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Given symmetric profit and holding ($1/$1) the critical ratio is 0.5; using a demand forecast based on the full sample set is reasonable now (no sustained regime change yet). I therefore set L by averaging observed lead times (to confirm actual L=0), and use default demand and volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively given recent high demand but limited history of a persistent shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Context: confirmed actual lead time = 0 (from prior conclude messages). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (used by backend): [100,69,92,77,111] \u2192 mean = 89.8 units per period, std used by backend. With L=0 we need to cover roughly one period of demand after ordering. No overdue or missing shipments are visible. I choose L=default (use promised lead time = 0) because arrivals have consistently concluded same-period. I choose mu_hat=default so backend will set (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 1*89.8 \u2014 this reflects the full-sample average demand and is appropriate because there is no strong, sustained recent regime shift. I choose sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to capture full-sample volatility. These choices keep the OR engine anchored to the long-run demand estimate while leveraging confirmed 0 lead time; with profit and holding cost equal, the backend's computed service quantile will balance fill rate vs. holding cost.

Daily Profit: $79.00, Daily Holding Cost: $17.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean = 89.8 units and no sustained changepoint; recent concluded arrivals show promised lead time = 0 confirmed (orders in P1-P4 arrived same period). Current on-hand = 17, in-transit = 0, and there are no overdue or missing shipments to account for. Given profit = holding cost, the backend's analytic base-stock formula is appropriate using the full-sample demand estimates. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=0) and default demand statistics so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level against holding cost while reflecting the confirmed same-period arrivals and the full historical demand sample. No explicit upward adjustment is needed because recent concluded demands do not show a sustained regime shift and there are no delayed shipments to hedge against.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision. Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P5) shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time = 0 each concluded period) and no in-transit inventory; on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Demand samples available (historical series used by backend): [100, 69, 92, 77, 111] with mean \u2248 89.8 and sample std \u2248 15.2. No evidence of lost or delayed shipments; therefore keep promised lead time. I choose L = default (use promised 0) so the OR engine will target a single-period forecast horizon. I choose mu_hat = default so the backend uses (1+L)*mean of all samples (stable historical average \u2248 89.8) to size the base-stock. I choose sigma_hat = default so the backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) (\u224815.2) to set safety stock. These conservative, history-based defaults keep service high given equal profit and holding cost ($1 profit, $1 holding): the backend will compute z to balance fill rate vs holding and the capped order size will prevent extreme overorders when L=0. Because on-hand + pipeline = 0, this policy will prompt the OR engine to order toward the base-stock appropriate for one-period demand while limiting excess inventory costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_7. Observed data through Period_6 show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed by concluded messages) and recent demands: Period_1-5 historical samples (100,69,92,77,111) with Period_6 demand=98. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pipeline cover. Promised lead time=0 and concluded arrivals consistently show actual L=0, so use observed lead time. With profit=$1 and holding=$1, critical fractile q = 0.5 (z* \u2248 0), so target base-stock should be approximately the (1+L)\xd7mean demand. Mean of the available sample set \u2248 89.8 units \u2192 target \u2248 90 units for the review+lead period. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistent with all samples; using calculate for L forces the engine to use observed lead times (confirming L=0). Given zero on-hand and pipeline, this results in an order up to the base-stock level to balance 50% service level vs holding cost and avoid lost sales. This parameterization is robust to the confirmed 0 lead time and avoids overreacting to short-term variation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, profit=$1/unit and holding=$1/unit imply critical ratio q=0.5 so service/holding tradeoff is balanced. Observed lead times are consistently 0 in concluded history (P1\u2013P7 arrivals matched orders same period), so I use the promised/default lead time. Demand shows a recent uptick versus the older baseline: using the most recent 5 concluded demand observations (Periods 3\u20137: 85, 79, 100, 98, 122) yields mean = 96.8 units and empirical std \u2248 15\u201317. This is higher than the older provided sample mean (~89.8), so I bias forecasts to the recent regime. Decisions: L=default to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals; mu_hat uses recent_N N=5 to set (1+L)\xd7recent mean and react quickly to the higher recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to capture current variability and ensure the backend increases safety stock appropriately. Because on-hand+pipeline=0, these choices raise the base-stock to cover the observed recent demand level while sigma_hat increases the safety buffer to avoid lost sales given the recent volatility. No evidence of lost shipments or multi-period lead-time drift is present in concluded periods.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 start. Recent demand (Periods 4\u20138) has been consistently around ~100 units with spikes to ~120; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 0 in concluded history (P1\u2013P8 arrivals all show lead_time=0), so I set L using observed lead times. To keep the forecast responsive to the recent higher-demand regime (last 5 periods: 79,100,98,122,121; mean=104), I choose mu_hat based on the most recent 5 demand observations (recent_N, N=5). Volatility also appears driven by the same recent window, so I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect current variability. These choices give the OR backend a (1+L)-period demand forecast anchored on the most recent regime and a matching variance estimate; with lead time confirmed as 0 this balances service level against holding cost by focusing safety stock on the recent demand level rather than long-ago lower-demand samples.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 decision. Recent demand has been variable and generally high (Period1-9 demands: 108,124,85,79,100,98,122,121,145) with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand. Historical concluded messages (through Period 9) consistently show arrivals same-period; earlier carry-over confirmed lead time = 0. No evidence of lost shipments or a change in lead time. Given profit = holding cost ($1 each) the critical fractile q = 0.5 so the OR backend will target the mean demand over the review+lead period; using the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) is appropriate and conservative. Default L uses the promised lead time (0) which matches concluded history; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine compute base stock from full-sample mean/variance, balancing service level and holding cost without overreacting to recent spikes. This also avoids over-ordering when demand spikes are not yet a sustained regime change.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demand (Periods 1-10) shows recent sustained higher demand since Period 6. Promised lead time is 0 and prior concluded messages (Periods 1-10) consistently show arrivals same-period, so I trust lead time = 0. No missing shipments observed. Given stable same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost orders, I choose the backend defaults so the OR engine uses (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This balances service level and holding cost: with L=0 the base-stock equals the demand mean plus safety stock computed from profit/(profit+holding) tradeoff; using all-sample statistics keeps estimates robust while recent elevated demand will be captured in the overall mean and variability. Because on-hand+pipeline=0, the OR engine will place orders to reach the computed base stock and restore availability for the current period's demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 6: avg demand P1-5 = 89.8 units, avg demand P6-10 = 120.2 units (+33.8%), sustained for 5 periods.

Period 12. Recent demand has shifted higher starting Period 6 (sustained through Period 10 per carry-over). Current on-hand = 15, in-transit = 0, so pipeline inventory is low relative to the higher-demand regime. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 across many periods, so using the promised lead time is appropriate. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set demand estimates using recent samples from the post-changepoint window (Periods 6\u201310) \u2014 N=5 \u2014 for both mean and volatility so the OR backend will target a higher base stock and a tighter safety buffer tuned to recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts under the new +33.8% regime) against holding cost: profit and holding cost are equal, so the backend will use q=0.5 (z\u22480), but raising mu_hat to the recent regime mean increases target inventory to meet demand while sigma_hat from recent data sets an appropriate safety adjustment. No in-transit arrivals are expected to be visible until the next conclude message.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 context: confirmed same-period arrivals historically (lead time = 0) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 6 (higher mean sustained for 7+ periods). Current on-hand = 17, in-transit = 0. With promised lead time = 0 and concluded history showing orders arriving same period, I keep L as default so OR backend uses the promised lead time. For demand I focus on the recent higher-demand regime (Periods 6\u201312) rather than the full-sample mean: I select recent_N with N=7 (Periods 6\u201312) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of the most recent sustained regime. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7 so the volatility estimate matches the recent regime. This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost by sizing base-stock around the recent higher mean and using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock from older low-demand periods. On-hand + expected same-period arrivals should cover immediate demand; using recent_N prevents understocking from the higher-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $32.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 context: on-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 6; recent actual demands (P6-P13) = [98,122,121,145,115,89,102,73], mean \u2248108.1, sample std \u224822.4. I choose L=default to reflect the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (capturing the sustained higher-demand regime from Period 6 onward) so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 8 samples (\u2248108.1) and sigma_hat from the same 8 samples (std \u224822.4). Rationale: using the recent 8-period window adapts to the identified regime shift (+~34% vs P1-5) while avoiding older low-demand data; keeping L at default (0) matches concluded lead times and prevents over-ordering for an assumed longer lead time. This balances service level (higher target base stock to avoid lost sales under the new regime) against holding cost by using recent volatility to set appropriate safety stock.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=46, in-transit=0. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concludes consistently show lead_time=0 (confirmed in earlier carry-over). Recent demand has trended down over the last five periods (Periods 10-14: 115, 89, 102, 73, 63) after an earlier sustained increase in Periods 6-10. To balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/unit), I use a short recent-window forecast so orders reflect the recent lower demand while still reacting to variability. I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand average (reduces overstock risk given current on-hand=46). I set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine uses recent volatility for safety stock sizing. This keeps base_stock aligned with current observed demand and avoids unnecessary holding given limited in-transit and elevated past demand volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 decision. Context: promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for many periods (P1-P15 arrivals all same-day), so I retain default lead time. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. Recent demand (Periods 11-15) = [89, 102, 73, 63, 142], mean = 93.8 with noticeable volatility and no clear sustained new regime (last three periods are inconsistent), so I bias the forecast to recent data to adapt to the apparent drop from the earlier elevated regime (Periods 6-10). Therefore: L = default (use promised 0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to set (1+L)*mean of the most recent 5 samples (keeps orders responsive to recent demand). sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility for safety stock sizing. These choices instruct the OR backend to place orders that cover roughly one period of recent demand while letting the backend compute the statistical safety buffer; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given on-hand=0) against holding cost by keeping the review horizon short and anchored to the latest observed demand.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 periods consistently (orders P1\u2013P16 arrived same period). Demand history P1\u2013P16 has mean \u2248104.625 and std \u224822.635. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so critical fractile q = 0.5; default base-stock sizing using full-sample mean/variance is appropriate given no recent sustained changepoint after the previously recorded regime shift. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (0) and default demand estimates (use all samples) so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level vs holding cost by relying on full-history estimates; with equal profit and holding cost the policy targets median demand and avoids systematic overstock given no new evidence of a regime change or lost shipments.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. Current context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0 in earlier periods (Period 1\u201317 arrivals all concluded with lead_time=0). Demand history (Periods 1\u201317) mean \u2248 107 units with intermittent spikes (e.g., P9, P15, P17) but no new sustained regime shift meeting the 3+ period significance threshold. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by concluded messages, so I keep L at the default (promised) to let the OR engine use its accurate lead-time assumption. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level and holding cost given profit = holding cost (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0 so target \u2248 mean demand). With pipeline=0, the backend will order toward the computed base stock (\u2248 mean demand) to cover same-period demand while avoiding excess holding given equal profit/holding.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 decision. Recent demand history: P14-18 = [63, 142, 108, 148, 109], prior confirmed regime shift (Period 6-10 higher demand) remains relevant but recent five periods show elevated mean with high variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) demand; no overdue shipments observed and lead time consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages repeatedly confirm 0-period actual lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of these recent samples and adapts to the recent elevated average (~114 units). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=5 to capture the observed increase in demand volatility in the last 5 periods (large swings between ~63 and ~148). These choices balance service level (use recent mean to avoid stockouts given recent high demand) against holding cost by limiting the horizon to recent data rather than the entire history.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: On-hand = 52, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded arrivals show all observed lead times = 0 (multiple concluded messages P1\u2192P19 all report lead_time 0), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand history exhibits a sustained higher-demand regime from Period 6 onward (carry-over insight recorded previously). No shipments are overdue or missing in recent history. Given confirmed L=0 and a sustained demand shift, I use 'calculate' for L to reflect observed lead times, and use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample set (this leverages all data while respecting the confirmed lead time). This balances service level vs holding cost: profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so the backend will target q=0.5; default mu/sigma let the OR engine compute the base stock and cap using full-sample statistics and the confirmed lead time, which is appropriate given no new short-term changepoint requiring aggressive recent-only forecasting.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order since Period_1 arrived in the same period (lead_time observed = 0 each time). Demand has been elevated since Period_6 (previous carry-over insight: demand regime shift starting Period_6 with ~+33.8% higher mean). Given consistent same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost or delayed shipments, I set lead time based on observed lead times. I use default demand estimation methods ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies the full-sample mean/variance (which incorporates the confirmed higher-demand regime). This balances service level (protecting against stockouts with higher recent mean demand) while letting the OR engine compute the z* tradeoff using the profit/holding cost ratio. With on-hand and in-transit at zero, these parameters will prompt the OR engine to replenish toward the base stock implied by the observed demand and confirmed zero lead time.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed in earlier periods). Demand history shows a sustained upward regime beginning Period 6; recent periods (P6\u2013P21) exhibit a higher mean than P1\u2013P5. I therefore keep lead time at the promised/default (L=0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. For demand forecasting I use recent_N over the most recent 16 periods (Periods 6\u201321) to capture the higher-demand regime and recent variability; this produces a (1+L)-period forecast anchored to the new regime rather than diluted by the low early-period samples. I also use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N=16 to reflect current volatility. These choices push the OR backend toward a higher base-stock appropriate for the elevated demand while keeping safety stock aligned to observed recent variability; keeping L=default avoids over-compensating for lead-time risk that the concluded history does not support. With profit=holding, the backend will target a service quantile of 0.5, so anchoring mu_hat and sigma_hat to the recent high-demand regime helps avoid stockouts while limiting excess holding given equal holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23 decision: observed on-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (confirmed in multiple conclude messages). Demand shows a sustained higher regime starting Period_6 (previous carry-over insight): recent demands (Periods 6\u201322) are higher than Periods 1\u20135. I therefore keep L at the default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 17 concluded periods (Periods 6\u201322). Using recent_N for mu_hat focuses the base-stock calculation on the current higher-demand regime so the OR engine will target sufficient stock to meet elevated demand; using recent_N for sigma_hat captures recent volatility to size safety stock appropriately. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the confirmed, sustained regime rather than older lower-demand data. With on-hand + pipeline = 2 units (effectively zero coverage), the backend will compute orders to raise pipeline toward the base-stock implied by the recent higher-demand mean and observed volatility.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and concluded history (Periods 1-23) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift beginning Period_6 (carry-over): average demand P1-5 = 89.8 vs P6-10 = 120.2 (+33.8%), and the elevated demand persisted through subsequent periods. Recent history (Periods 6-23) therefore best represents current demand. I choose L=default (use promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=18 to cover Periods 6-23 (regime length=18) so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant elevated-demand regime. This focuses the base-stock on the higher sustained demand and keeps holding costs in check by using only the current regime for volatility and mean. With L=0 the policy will target one-period demand; given on-hand=0 and no pipeline, this avoids underordering relative to the confirmed higher-demand regime.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 context: lead time has consistently been 0 in all concluded periods (orders arriving same period), demand has been in the higher regime since Period_6 (carry-over insight). Recent realized demands (Periods 20-24 = 102,107,105,107,104) average ~105 and show low short-term variance. On-hand = 3, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments visible. To keep service while avoiding extra holding cost, I set L to the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the sustained higher-demand regime as seen in the last 5 periods; this keeps the base-stock sized for current demand, not diluted by older low-regime data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock is calibrated to the recent lower volatility. These choices help the OR backend balance fill rate (profit = $1/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) by sizing reorder to cover the (1+L) review+lead window based on the most relevant recent observations.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrived=ordered in the same period (lead time observed = 0 repeatedly), so promised lead time=0 remains valid. Demand history (Periods 1\u201325) has a sustained higher regime since Period 6 (already recorded in carry-over insights), giving an overall mean demand \u2248105.7 units/period. With lead time = 0, the OR backend's default calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) are appropriate to set the base-stock and safety stock using the full sample history; this balances service level (profits forgone if stockouts) against holding costs given profit = holding cost. Because on-hand and in-transit are zero, I want the backend to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all available samples and use the promised lead time so orders will be sized to cover the immediate period's demand plus safety stock.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 decision. Observed history through Period 26 shows consistent concluded lead times of 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period in conclude messages through P26). On-hand = 24, in-transit = 0. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so service-level target q = 0.5 (z* = 0), meaning the OR engine will target mean demand across the review+lead period. No recent, sustained changepoint after the previously recorded regime shift (Period 6-10). To keep the backend forecast aligned with the promised lead time and the long-run sample statistics, I use defaults: promised L (0) and default demand moments so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This avoids overreacting to single-period fluctuations and is appropriate given the confirmed lead time=0 and no new sustained demand regime. With these settings the OR backend will order toward the sample mean demand and avoid extra safety stock (z*=0) given equal profit/holding costs, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 decision. Recent history shows concluded actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals report lead_time=0). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover this period's demand plus safety. Given no evidence of new regime change since the previously recorded shift (Period 6-10) and stable repeated 0 lead-time confirmations, I choose to use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base_stock from the full historical sample mean/variance and the promised lead time (0). This keeps ordering consistent with long-run data, lets the backend set service level via profit/(profit+holding) and caps order size appropriately, and avoids overreacting to single-period fluctuations. Using defaults also leverages all available samples to smooth variance estimates while the on-hand/pipeline is zero and shipments have not been delayed.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand has been elevated and variable across periods ~60\u2013148 with many recent periods near or above 100; the OR backend default policy ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) is appropriate given stable confirmed lead time=0 and no evidence of a new sustained changepoint since prior carry-over insights. No overdue or lost shipments to reconcile. I select default L to respect the promised lead time (and confirmed historical 0), and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the backend computes base-stock using the full-sample mean and volatility, balancing service level (profit=holding cost \u2192 q=0.5, moderate z*) against holding cost. This keeps ordering responsive to observed demand while avoiding extra manual tuning absent a new sustained signal.

Daily Reward (R_t): $92.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand = 6, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded messages (through Period 29) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period) and no recent missing shipments. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime that began at Period 6 (as previously recorded), so we should preserve that in forecasting. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded data confirms it, so use default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with reality. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all observed samples (this leverages the full sample set, including the higher-demand regime) \u2014 appropriate because we have a long, stable sequence and no new changepoint meeting the 3-period sustained threshold. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1), implying the critical fractile q = 0.5 (median); using defaults lets the OR engine set base stock around the estimated mean demand across the review+lead period, balancing stockouts and holding costs. Given current on-hand is small (6) and no in-transit, this will prompt the OR engine to order toward the computed base-stock to cover expected demand while avoiding excess inventory.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 context: on-hand=17, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and past concluded history confirms lead time=0 (Period 3 evidence). Recent realized demand (Periods 26-30): [80,115,132,98,87], mean=102.4, std \u2248 19.9. Profit and holding cost are both $1/unit, so critical fractile q = 0.5 (z*\u22480) \u2014 the OR backend will target roughly the forecast mean across the review+lead period. I choose L=default to trust the promised (and historically confirmed) 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent regime and avoid dilution from older lower-demand periods; mu_hat therefore targets (1+L)*mean(recent 5)=102.4 units. Sigma is set using recent_N (N=5) so the backend estimates variability from the same recent window (std \u224819.9 scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This keeps target base-stock close to recent realized demand, balancing service (profit per unit sold equals holding cost so we avoid large inventory buildup) while responding to the higher demand regime established earlier. Given on-hand=17 and no in-transit, the OR engine will order up toward the base-stock computed from these parameters.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201331) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so use the promised/default lead time. Demand history (Periods 1\u201331) shows the previously recorded regime shift starting Period 6 (higher mean) and no new sustained changepoint in the most recent periods. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0 each) giving q = 0.5 (z* \u2248 0), so the OR backend will target roughly the mean demand across the review+lead period; using default (all-sample) estimates keeps the forecast stable and avoids overreacting to short-term noise. Default sigma is used so the backend can compute variability and the capped order limit. This choice balances service level and holding cost conservatively given no new evidence of regime change or lead-time issues and the current zero on-hand/pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent history (Periods 1-32) shows consistent same-period arrivals with observed lead_time = 0 in concluded messages across many periods; demand samples shown in history range around a mean near 104 in later periods after an earlier regime shift. Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we have no coverage for the upcoming demand \u2014 must rely on forecast rather than overdue shipments. I select L=default to trust the promised lead time of 0 (well supported by many concluded arrivals). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select default to let the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_of_all_samples respectively; this uses the full historical sample set to smooth earlier noise while reflecting the established higher-demand regime starting Period 6. Using defaults keeps the base-stock anchored to observed long-run mean/variance, balancing service level (profit=holding cost so q=0.5) against holding cost without overreacting to single-period spikes. No evidence of lost shipments or new lead-time shifts to justify explicit adjustments.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (observed consistently in Periods 1\u201333). A demand regime shift was previously detected starting Period 6 (avg P1-5 = 89.8 vs avg P6-10 = 120.2, +33.8%) and has persisted; recent periods remain in the higher-demand regime. Because that shift is sustained and we currently hold no stock or pipeline, I bias forecasts to recent higher-demand behavior. I therefore keep L at the default (promised lead time = 0, which matches observed arrivals) and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 20 demand samples (captures the sustained, higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise). This choice balances service (avoid stockouts when demand is higher) against holding cost by relying on a 20-period recent window rather than all-sample averaging. No overdue or missing shipments to account for.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35. On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P34) consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0 (confirmed earlier at Period 3), so I will trust same-period arrivals. Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime since Period 6 (noted in carry-over), so maintaining the backend's default aggregation over all samples provides a balanced base-stock that the OR engine will scale by (1+L). Using default L (=promised lead time = 0) keeps orders arriving same-period to meet demand quickly; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1). No new sustained changepoint or missing shipments detected this period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201335) consistently show arrived=ordered with lead_time=0; prior carry-over also confirmed lead time = 0. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (carry-over: avg P1-5 = 89.8, avg P6-10 = 120.2 and sustained). To keep the OR backend responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting noise from old, lower-demand early periods, I set L to use the promised lead time (default). For demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 (the backend rule caps to recent regime up to 20) so the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are computed from the most recent 20 demand samples. This biases the base-stock toward the confirmed higher-demand regime, improving service while the sigma estimate captures recent variability. No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. Demand history through Period 36 shows a higher, sustained regime since Period 6 (carry-over insight already recorded). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover upcoming demand immediately. Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so using default L (promised) is appropriate and keeps orders arriving same period. For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach with N=20 (last 20 periods: Period 17\u201336) because the primary regime shift occurred earlier (Period 6) and the most relevant data for current demand level is the recent two dozen observations; N=20 is within the allowed range and balances responsiveness with noise reduction. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) captures recent volatility rather than older lower-demand samples. These choices give the OR backend a (1+L)-period demand estimate tuned to the current regime and a volatility estimate reflecting recent variability, which together balance service level (avoid stockouts given on-hand=0) against holding cost (avoid excessive overstock).

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38 context: on-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (many periods) confirm actual lead time = 0 repeatedly (orders arriving same period). There is a previously recorded sustained demand regime shift starting Period_6 (carry-over insight from game history): average demand increased and has persisted for many periods. Given on-hand is low and no pipeline, I must replenish to cover upcoming demand under the higher regime.

L selection: use promised/default lead time (0) because concluded arrivals across many periods consistently show lead_time = 0; no recent evidence of delay or lost shipments.

mu_hat selection: choose recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. Use N=20 (rule: use most recent regime length capped at 20) so the forecast reflects the last 20 demand observations rather than older low-demand periods. This yields a (1+L)\xd7mean based on the recent regime and helps the OR backend set a base-stock that services the higher demand while avoiding over-weighting early low-demand samples.

sigma_hat selection: choose recent_N with N=20 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. Matching the mu and sigma windows keeps service-level calculations coherent (same evidence period). A recent-window sigma prevents underestimating variability due to older quieter periods, which would reduce safety stock and risk stockouts.

Overall: L=default keeps lead-time assumptions aligned with observed deliveries; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=20) incorporates the confirmed, sustained higher-demand regime and balances service level versus holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in early carry-over). Demand has been elevated since Period_6 (carry-over insight), but most recent 5 periods (P34-P38) show mean ~104.2 with moderate variability. With profit = holding, target service level q = 0.5 (z*\u22480) so base-stock centers on the forecasted demand across review+lead. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded history shows consistent 0 lead time. To keep the forecast responsive to the most recent regime and current near-term demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand observations). This produces an (1+L)-adjusted mean that reflects current demand and a volatility estimate reflecting recent variability, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost without overreacting to older data. No overdue shipments are present (in-transit=0), so no explicit lead-time adjustment is needed.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40 context: on-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), and prior carry-over already recorded a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period_6. Recent demand remains higher than the initial P1-5 baseline. Promised lead time = 0 and concluded observations confirm actual lead time = 0, so use calculated lead time. To make the OR backend responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the post-changepoint regime length while capping N at 20). This ensures the backend's base-stock (which multiplies by 1+L) reflects current elevated demand and that the volatility estimate is based on recent variability. Using recent data balances service level (reduce stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost by avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201340) confirm actual lead time = 0 consistently and an earlier demand regime shift starting Period 6 (higher mean sustained). Inventory is low (16) with no pipeline, so we should size orders to cover the current higher-demand regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals across history confirm 0 periods. For demand level (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the most recent sustained higher-demand regime while respecting the N caps; this uses the last 20 observed demands to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N with N=20 to capture recent variability rather than older low-demand periods. These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking for the sustained higher-demand regime (reducing stockouts) while letting the backend compute the exact base-stock and cap given the equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5) which drives a moderate service level.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 decision. Current on-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed in prior conclude messages), and the documented demand regime shift (starting Period 6) is already recorded in carry-over history. There are no new sustained changepoints in demand or lead time in the most recent periods (Periods 36-41 demand has varied but shows no >3-period sustained shift). Given confirmed same-period replenishment and stable, higher-demand regime established earlier, I use the default lead time (promised 0) so the OR engine treats review+lead as 1 period. I also choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this leverages the full demand history including the previously identified regime shift and keeps estimates stable rather than overreacting to recent noise. This setup provides a balanced base-stock target: it asks the OR engine to cover one-period demand with a service-level-driven safety stock while avoiding excessive holding since holding cost equals profit (q = 0.5) and extremes from short recent fluctuations. With on-hand=43 and no in-transit, the OR engine will compute an order to raise pipeline+on-hand toward the base stock while capping order size via its cap rule, limiting over-ordering and reducing holding cost risk.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 context: on-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed have arrived same period) so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Demand has had earlier regime evidence of a higher-demand regime starting Period 6 (recorded previously) but most recent 5 periods (P38-P42) show softer demand, so no new sustained changepoint. Given profit = holding cost (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), the OR backend will target mu_hat as the base-stock; using default methods lets the backend compute (1+L)*mean of all samples and volatility from full history, which balances service level vs holding cost without overfitting to short noisy swings. This choice also avoids overreacting to recent low-demand noise and leverages the long-run demand signal and proven lead-time=0 behavior. If prolonged low/high demand persists, I will switch to a recent_N or EWMA in future periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 decision. On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly in history and earlier carry-over insight), so I use the promised/default lead time. Demand exhibited a sustained regime increase beginning at Period 6 (noted in carry-over insights). To capture the most recent, higher-demand regime and its volatility, I use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 20 demand observations; this biases base-stock up to reduce stockouts under the higher-demand regime while the sigma estimate raises safety stock for variability. Given Profit = Holding, the backend will target a balanced service level; these recent-N choices ensure the backend's mean/variance inputs reflect the sustained higher-demand regime observed since Period 6. No in-transit arrivals are expected to appear this period (arrivals are seen only in conclude messages next period), so ordering should replenish from current on-hand and recent demand patterns.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. Recent demand has fallen sharply versus the earlier high-demand regime confirmed in carry-over. On-hand = 32, in-transit = 0 so available inventory is limited. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 (confirmed earlier), so I keep L at the promised/default. Demand over the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 40-44 = 91,64,65,62,68) averages ~70 units, a sustained ~35% drop from the preceding window (Periods 31-39 avg ~108). To make ordering responsive to this sustained decline and avoid excess holding cost (holding cost = profit = $1 so we prioritize avoiding inventory), I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)*mean of the last 5 samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 so safety stock reflects the recent lower volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock compared with using all-sample averages, lowering overstock risk while still covering short-term demand. Given on-hand=32 and no in-transit, the OR engine will compute orders to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the recent-demand-based base stock while capping order sizes per its cap rule.

Carry-over insight: New demand drop starting Period 40: avg demand P31-39 = 108.3 units, avg demand P40-44 = 70.0 units (\u221235.3%), sustained for 5 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $70.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: recent history shows the demand drop regime that started at Period 40 continues but with a one-period spike in Period 45 (116). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we need an order to meet upcoming demand this period. All concluded lead-time observations remain 0, so use default promised lead time (L=0). For demand forecast I focus on the post-drop regime (Periods 40\u201345) where regime length = 6; I select recent_N with N=6 so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples (captures the new lower baseline while softening the single spike). For volatility I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect observed variability in the same recent window. These choices prioritize matching the new lower-demand regime while remaining responsive to the Period 45 spike; with L=0 the backend will calculate base_stock directly for immediate fulfillment and the capped policy limits order size to control holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple orders arrived same period). A sustained lower-demand regime was recorded starting Period 40 (carry-over insight). Recent observed demand (Periods 40-46) = [91,64,65,62,68,116,81]; regime length = 7. Because the drop starting Period 40 is sustained, I use a recent_N forecast to focus the OR engine on the lower, recent demand pattern while still including the small rebound/spike. L set to default (promised lead time 0) consistent with confirmed same-period arrivals. mu_hat: recent_N with N=7 to capture recent regime mean over Periods 40-46 ((91+64+65+62+68+116+81)/7 \u2248 77.6) scaled by (1+L)=1 \u2014 this keeps base_stock aligned to the recent lower demand. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility including the spike in Period 45. This choice reduces overstocking risk from older high-demand periods while allowing the OR backend to size safety stock to recent variability.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 decision. Context: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier in carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. Recent demand is volatile but the last 5 realized demands (P43-P47 = 62, 68, 116, 81, 127) give a current short-horizon picture with mean \u2248 90.8. There is a previously recorded demand drop starting P40 that was sustained through P44, but P45-47 showed high volatility and no new sustained regime (fewer than 3 consecutive periods of a new level), so I will not record a new carry-over insight. Decisions: keep L at default (promised lead time 0 \u2014 consistent with confirmed lead time 0) so the OR engine treats demand horizon as 1 period. Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 to reflect the most recent regime and to be responsive to current variability (this provides (1+L)\xd7mean over last 5 periods). For sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to give the OR engine an up-to-date volatility estimate reflecting recent swings. This combination biases ordering toward matching current short-run demand while avoiding forcing the long-run historical mean that is less representative of the immediate recent volatility. It also keeps safety stock moderate given equal profit and holding cost (profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 \u2192 z\u22480), so responsiveness is prioritized over large buffer stock.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 context: on-hand=8, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 which has been consistently confirmed by concluded messages (lead_time observed = 0 in prior periods). Recent demand has been noisy: P44-P48 demand = [68,116,81,127,83] with an average ~95 and notable spikes (P45, P47). Earlier carry-over noted a sustained demand drop starting P40 (P40-44 avg=70), but the last few periods show higher variability and some rebounds. Given low on-hand and no pipeline, I choose a responsive short-window demand estimate so the OR engine can raise target inventory to cover immediate demand while avoiding long-term overstock. Selections: L=default to use promised/confirmed 0; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand regime and be responsive to the recent rebound/spikes; sigma_hat=default so the backend applies the historical volatility scaled for (1+L). This balances service (capture recent higher demand) against holding cost (avoid using a long historical mean that would inflate stock after the earlier drop).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (recorded earlier). Demand showed a sustained drop starting Period 40 (carry-over insight): recent regime from Period 40\u201349 is the most relevant for forecasting. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) since concluded history supports it. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 (the length of the current post-change regime, Period 40\u201349) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and variability based on the most recent sustained lower-demand regime. This reduces overstock risk from pre-drop means while still covering immediate demand. Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures recent volatility in the low-demand regime, letting the backend compute a smaller base stock and cap to balance service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost.
