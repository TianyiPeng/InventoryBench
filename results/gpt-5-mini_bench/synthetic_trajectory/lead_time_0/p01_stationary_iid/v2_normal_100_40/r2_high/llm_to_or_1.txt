Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [143, 103, 39, 81, 99] with mean = 93 units and sample std \u2248 33.8. Promised lead time is 0 and there is no evidence of delayed/lost shipments or lead-time change (no conclude messages), so use the default lead time. Using defaults keeps the OR engine's standard base-stock calculation: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 93 (with L=0) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 33.8. Given profit $19 and holding $1, the service-level target q = 19/20 = 0.95 (high), so the backend will produce a high z and order to protect against stockouts while balancing holding cost. These default choices are conservative but appropriate when no new regime or lead-time evidence exists and starting inventory is zero.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-96.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period: Period_2. Context: Promised lead time = 0. Visible history (Period_1 conclude) shows an order placed on Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (arrived=156, lead_time=0). Current inventory: on-hand=153, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples provided (143,103,39,81,99) have mean=93 and population std\u224833.76. Because the concluded history confirms the promised same-period lead time and there is no sustained demand regime change (recent observed sale in Period 1 was small but not yet a regime), I select the default methods so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This sets L to the promised 0 so the backend will target a base-stock for the immediate-period demand; mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults capture the historical mean demand (93 units per period) and its volatility (~33.8), balancing service level (through mean + safety stock) against low holding cost ($1/unit). Given on-hand=153 and no in-transit, this will let the OR engine decide an order that covers expected near-term demand without overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period_1 order arrived in Period_1, arrived=156 units ordered on Period_1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 context: confirmed lead time = 0 (observed arrivals for P1 and P2 arrived same period). Historical demand samples (used by OR) have mean = 93 units/period and moderate variance. Current on-hand = 144, in-transit = 0, profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit indicates high service priority but low holding cost. Given confirmed 0 lead time and on-hand comfortably above the one-period expected demand (\u224893), I will use the default/neutral parameter choices so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and std of all samples. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise; with L=0 the OR base-stock will reflect single-period demand. No explicit inflation of forecasts is needed because inventories already exceed expected demand and no overdue shipments are observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1466.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision: on-hand=73, in-transit=0, recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived same period (lead_time observed = 0). Use promised/observed lead time of 0. I choose default forecasting so the OR backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L) \xd7 mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) \xd7 std(all samples) using the provided historical demand samples (143,103,39,81,99). Rationale: confirmed lead time = 0 (no indication of lost/delayed shipments), inventory is healthy relative to recent demands (most recent concluded demand was 81), and default methods leverage the full sample set to provide stable mean/variance estimates for the base-stock calculation. This balances service level (profit high at $19/unit) against low holding cost ($1/unit) without overreacting to the single high recent demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1751.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [143,103,39,81,99] (mean=93). Recent concluded periods show all orders arriving same period (lead_time observed = 0 in Periods 1-4). Current on-hand=54, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Given consistent zero observed lead time and no evidence of shipment loss or a demand regime shift (demand samples show variability but no sustained change), I set lead time to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0). For demand forecast and uncertainty I use the defaults so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding overstock given current moderate on-hand inventory and observed same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2132.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision. Recent conclude history shows same-period arrivals (confirmed lead time 0) and a clear demand uptick over the last three concluded periods: demands = 81, 95, 114. On-hand = 34, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is low relative to recent demand. I select L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals (average observed = 0). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new, higher regime (focus on 81,95,114) so the OR engine will target a base-stock sized to cover the (1+L)-period demand under the new regime rather than long-run lower mean. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect the current volatility in the new regime. These choices increase reorder quantity to protect service against the demonstrated higher demand while keeping volatility estimates tight so the OR backend's cap limits extreme over-ordering and balances holding cost against profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 3-5 (concluded): avg demand increased to 96.67 over Periods 3-5 (81,95,114) vs avg 10.0 in Periods 1-2 (3,17); sustained for 3 periods, treat as new higher-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1396.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 context: recent demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 3 (demands: 81,95,114,76). Promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20136 all show lead_time=0, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Current inventory: on-hand=48, in-transit=0 \u2014 insufficient versus recent demand. I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend confirm the observed lead time=0 from concluded history. For demand I detect a changepoint at Period 3 and use the last 4 periods (Periods 3\u20136) as the current regime (regime length=4 \u2192 N=4). Therefore mu_hat uses recent_N (N=4) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 4 samples (mean=91.5) to reflect the new higher demand. sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine targets safety stock appropriate to the confirmed higher-demand regime while accounting for the zero lead time, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given low on-hand) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1420.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 decision. Current on-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1-7) are all 0, so use calculated average lead time = 0. Demand history: [3,17,81,95,114,76,77]. A sustained regime shift to higher demand occurred starting Period 3; the most recent stable regime spans Periods 3-7 (demands: 81,95,114,76,77). I therefore set L using 'calculate' (reflecting observed lead times=0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to base mu_hat on the last 5 periods (Periods 3-7) so the OR engine targets the higher-demand regime rather than diluting with early low values. I also use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices aim to keep service (avoid stockouts under the higher demand) while not overstating uncertainty, balancing profit vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 9. On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods 1\u20138): 143,103,39,81,99,90,72,73? (note: earlier summary lists samples; concluded per-period sold sequence shows strong shift from low initial demand to sustained higher demand from Periods 3\u20138 with recent demands 81,95,114,76,77,108 -> avg ~91.8). Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals each period confirm actual lead time = 0, so I use default lead time. I detect a sustained higher-demand regime across the recent 6 periods (Periods 3\u20138), so I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 to focus the forecast on the current regime ((1+L)*mean of last 6 periods). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=6 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. This raises target base-stock to meet higher expected demand while keeping holding cost in mind (holding cost is low $1 vs profit $19, so service level should be high). Given on-hand=8 and no in-transit, these parameters will prompt the OR backend to replenish toward the regime-driven base stock quickly.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: recent demand has shifted up since Period 3. Historical demands (Periods 1-9): [3,17,81,95,114,76,77,108,88]. On-hand=31, in-transit=0, no overdue or missing shipments (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). Promised lead time=0 and all observed lead times = 0, so set L via observed average. Profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit favors high service level. I detect a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 3 (Periods 3-9, 7 periods) so I base demand forecast on the most recent regime to avoid understocking. Therefore: L set to calculate (average observed lead time = 0). mu_hat: use recent_N over the last 7 periods (Periods 3-9) to capture the higher mean demand (avg \u2248 91.29). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=7 to capture recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to cover higher demand while the low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19) justify holding more inventory to avoid lost sales.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders from P1\u2013P10 arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 6\u201310 = 76,77,108,88,125) reflects the higher-demand regime previously recorded and shows a stockout in Period 10 (demand 125, sold 117) \u2014 evidence we should target the new, higher mean. Profit=$19 and holding=$1 give q=19/20=0.95, implying the OR engine will target a high service level; to support that without excessive holding, I use recent demand statistics (last 5 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current volatility and mean. I choose L=calculate to confirm lead time=0 from observed data. This setup increases target base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability so the cap prevents runaway orders. No overdue/lost shipments visible.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_12. On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and concluded history shows every past order arrived same-period (lead_time=0 consistently), so use observed lead time average. Demand history since Period_3 exhibits a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 3\u201311 mostly high: 81,95,114,76,77,108,88,125,107). I therefore base demand forecast on the most recent stable regime rather than the low initial two periods. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N over the 9 most recent post-changepoint samples (Periods 3\u201311) to capture current mean and volatility across the review+lead period (1+L). This keeps service high for the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding excess inventory from the low-demand startup periods. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures safety stock reflects current variability. L set to calculate (backend will infer average observed lead time=0).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 context: all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand (Periods 3-12) has been in a higher regime (81,95,114,76,77,108,88,125,107,82) with mean \u224895.3 and sustained for 10 periods; earlier Periods 1-2 were very low (3,17, mean 10.0). Current on-hand=44, in-transit=0. Given the clearly elevated and sustained demand regime, I set L to the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For the demand forecast I use recent_N over the last 10 periods (the detected new regime length) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples (captures the elevated demand and avoids dilution by the very low early samples). I use sigma_hat recent_N with N=10 to reflect volatility within the new regime. These choices give the OR engine a base-stock that targets service for the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding under-ordering from old low-demand data; keeping L=default prevents the backend from over-penalizing pipeline because arrivals have historically been same-period.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed at Periods 3-12: avg demand = 95.3 (Periods 3-12) vs avg 10.0 (Periods 1-2); sustained high-demand regime for 10 periods

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 context: on-hand=24, in-transit=0; historical concluded arrivals show every order from Periods 1\u201313 arrived same period (lead_time=0 each time), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand history through Period 13 shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 3 (recent 11 periods average ~95) but the full-sample mean is ~82.5; there are no overdue or missing shipments to account for. Profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) implies a high target service level (q \u2248 0.95) so the OR engine will set a high base-stock to avoid stockouts. I choose the default/robust approach: use promised lead time (default L=0) and let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample so the OR engine combines the long-run evidence with its quantile rule; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise while respecting the confirmed 0 lead time and high service-level implied by profit/holding. No explicit upward adjustment is needed because concluded history already reflects the higher-demand regime and arrivals have been reliable.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 decision. Observed history shows actual lead time consistently 0 (concluded arrivals each period matched same-period orders through Period 14). On-hand = 16, in-transit = 0. Demand has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 3 through at least Period 13 (carry-over insight already recorded: avg ~95 over Periods 3-12). Given the sustained high-demand regime (length = 10 for Periods 3-12), I use a recent_N forecast so the OR engine's (1+L)\xd7mean will reflect the current high-demand level rather than diluting with the very low early-period samples. I select L = default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose recent_N with N = 10 (regime length = 10 \u2192 N = 10) to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 10 demand samples, which targets service levels toward current demand while keeping holding costs moderated. This setting helps the backend produce a base-stock that balances the high unit profit ($19) against the modest holding cost ($1) by using the recent high-demand estimates rather than older low-demand periods. With on-hand low and no pipeline, the OR will likely order to rebuild to the base stock appropriate for the high-demand regime.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16. On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders from Periods 1\u201315 all arrived same period); no evidence of lost shipments. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 3 (multiple-periods confirmed in prior carry-over notes). To reflect the sustained higher demand and prioritize service (profit $19 vs holding $1), I use a recent-N forecast that focuses on the post-changepoint high-demand regime. L: keep default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0. mu_hat: recent_N with N=13 to cover Periods 3\u201315 (the sustained high-demand regime) so the base stock uses the most relevant mean. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=13 to capture volatility in the same recent high-demand window. This raises the estimated demand and safety stock to avoid stockouts (high profit per unit) while the holding cost is low; using recent data prevents dilution by the very low early-period demands.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 decision: confirmed lead time = 0 (multiple concluded arrivals show orders arriving same period). Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 3 and especially in the last 10 periods (Periods 7\u201316) where avg demand \u2248103.5 units/period. On-hand=31, in-transit=0 so current visible coverage is ~0.3 of one-period demand. Profit/Holding implies a high service-level target (q = 19/(19+1)=0.95) so the OR backend will pick a high z. To avoid stockouts while minimizing holding cost, I use a recent-window forecast anchored on the most recent 10 periods to reflect the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility. Therefore: set L to default (promised 0); set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 10 demand samples so the backend computes (1+L)*mean_recent; set sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 10 samples so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std_recent. This balances the high service-level implied by profit with up-to-date demand evidence and addresses the lack of in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18 context: all observed arrivals since Period_1 have lead_time=0 (every conclude shows arrived same-period), and recent demand has been in the high-demand regime that began at Period_3 and persisted through Period_17. Current on-hand=72, in-transit=0. Given profit=$19 and holding=$1, the OR engine will compute a relatively high service-level (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/20 = 0.95). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 3\u201317) I use recent data from that regime to set demand estimates so orders target the current higher baseline rather than being pulled down by the low demand in Periods 1\u20132. L: use default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0-period lead times. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=15 to cover Periods 3\u201317 (regime length=15) so the (1+L)\xd7mean is driven by the confirmed higher-demand regime and not diluted by the very low early periods. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=15 to measure volatility from the same regime. This selection balances service level (high profit justifies a high q) against holding cost by letting the backend compute z* from profit/holding but seeding mu/sigma from the sustained high-demand regime. On-hand (72) + pipeline (0) will be compared by the OR engine to the computed base_stock; using recent_N prevents under-ordering driven by early-low samples. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift to adjust L upward.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Inventory: on-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders from Periods 1\u201318 all arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 3 (many periods of ~80\u2013130 demand). I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For forecasting I use recent_N over the most recent 16 demand periods (Periods 3\u201318) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime rather than diluting with the low demand in Periods 1\u20132. Thus mu_hat uses recent_N N=16 so the OR engine will target a base-stock sized to meet (1+L) periods of recent high demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=16 to reflect volatility in the high-demand regime. This raises target inventory to avoid stockouts given high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) while still constraining orders through the engine's cap. No shipments appear overdue and no lost-order signals present.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_20 decision: all concluded arrivals from Periods 1-19 show actual lead time = 0 (consistent each period). Current on-hand=35, in-transit=0. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 3 (confirmed in prior carry-over). To keep service while controlling holding cost (Profit=$19 vs Hold=$1), I set lead time to default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the most recent high-demand regime to capture the elevated mean and recent variability: N=17 (Periods 3-19 encompass the sustained high regime and provide maximum recent coverage without exceeding available history). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std on the recent high-demand samples so base-stock targets reflect the confirmed higher demand and recent volatility, balancing fill rate against carrying cost. This choice ensures orders target covering the immediate period demand (L+1=1 period) using the most relevant recent demand statistics.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historical concludes consistently show lead_time=0 (orders in Periods 1-20 all arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 3 (carry-over insight already recorded). Recent demand (Periods 11-20) = [107,82,100,128,120,100,61,77,94,147], mean = 101.6 units, sample std \u2248 25.5. With no pipeline and zero lead time, we must restock to cover immediate next-period demand while balancing high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). Decisions: set L to default (use promised lead time 0 since concludes confirm same-period arrivals); set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent_N=10 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility (mean \u2248101.6, std \u224825.5). This raises the base-stock and caps orders using the OR engine's cap logic, prioritizing service (high profit per unit) while keeping holding cost modest. Using recent 10 periods avoids diluting the current high-demand signal with the very low early-period values and captures recent variability for safety stock.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 decision. Current inventory: on-hand=98, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (many periods with arrived=ordered same period), so I keep L as default (promised 0). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 3 (carry-over insight recorded previously: high-demand regime sustained through Periods 3-12 and beyond). To keep orders responsive to the recent high-demand behavior and reduce stockouts while controlling holding cost, I use recent_N forecasts based on the most recent data. I choose N=10 (last 10 concluded demand periods) to capture the latest demand level and variability while smoothing short-term noise; N=10 is within available sample size and matches the sustained regime length. This raises mu_hat to reflect the higher recent mean demand across the review+lead period and sets sigma_hat from recent variability so the OR engine's base-stock and cap calculations provide enough buffer for service without excessive holding. With on-hand=98 and no in-transit, these parameters will prompt the OR engine to order toward a base-stock calibrated to recent higher demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23 context: on-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period_3 (avg \u224895 over many periods). Profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), so we should aim for a high service level and let the OR engine compute base stock from the full demand history. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand statistics so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all observed samples; this leverages the confirmed 0 lead time and the sustained high-demand regime while letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost automatically. No extraordinary explicit adjustments are required given confirmed same-period arrivals and no evidence of new changepoints since Period_13.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 decision: promised lead time = 0 and concluded history (Periods 1-23) consistently shows arrivals same period (many concluded messages with lead_time 0), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 entering Period_24, so we must replenish to cover current-period demand plus cover review+lead horizon. Historical demand shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning at Period_3 and continuing through Period_23 (many periods of high demand). I therefore use: L=default to trust the promised lead time (backed by repeated concluded evidence), mu_hat set with recent_N using the most recent 20 demand periods to reflect the long, sustained high-demand regime (N=20 chosen because regime length >20 and rule caps at 20), and sigma_hat set with recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices push the OR backend to size base stock around the recent high-demand mean and measured variability, balancing the high per-unit profit ($19) against relatively low holding cost ($1) by prioritizing service level while keeping safety stock linked to observed recent volatility. This approach also responds to the immediate stockout (on-hand=0) and zero pipeline so the next arrival (same-period) can satisfy Period_24 demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 decision. Context: on-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times across periods 1\u201324 are consistently 0 (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0), so I keep L at the promised/default (0). Demand regime: a sustained high-demand regime has been in effect since Period 3 (previous carry-over noted avg \u224895 over extended window). To capture the current high-demand level while smoothing noise, I use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent 20 concluded demand observations, which aligns with the sustained regime length while respecting the N selection rule). This gives the OR engine a demand forecast reflective of the recent high-demand regime and a volatility estimate based on recent variability. Using recent data raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts under the high-demand regime; capping in the backend and the relatively low holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit) keeps overstock risk acceptable. No evidence of new lead-time delays or lost shipments; in-transit=0 but past behavior shows same-period arrivals so ordering to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand is appropriate.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 decision. Current on-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201325) consistently show arrivals in the same period (arrived=... ordered on same Period each time), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0 \u2014 shipments have been reliable and prompt. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 3 (sustained elevated demands through Period 25), so mean demand used by backend should reflect the full historical sample of high-demand periods. Given lead time = 0 and reliable arrivals, I let the OR engine use its default calculations so base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) plus its safety factor; this balances service level (profit much larger than holding cost) while avoiding over-specifying mu/sigma that could overreact to short-term noise. Using defaults also lets the backend apply its capped-order rule with its cap computed from the same historical stats. This keeps ordering aligned with observed reliable lead time and the sustained higher-demand regime while accounting for current on-hand (49) and zero pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1488.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: on-hand=70, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (many concluded messages with arrived units and lead_time=0), so promised lead time = 0 is reliable. Profit per unit is $19 and holding cost $1 \u2192 target service level q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, implying a high safety stock. Demand has been in a sustained high-demand regime for many periods (carry-over insight from earlier periods: long-run average ~95+), so I bias forecasts toward recent realized demand rather than the small-sample prior. I choose L = default (use promised lead time = 0). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime from the most recent periods (this follows the changepoint evidence of a sustained higher regime and keeps responsiveness to any recent shifts). For uncertainty (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N with N=10 so the backend computes variability from the same recent window; pairing mu_hat and sigma_hat from the same recent window ensures the OR engine's base-stock and cap reflect current volatility. This configuration keeps service high (matching q\u22480.95) while using recent demand to avoid over- or under-stocking due to outdated low-demand data. No shipments appear overdue, so no explicit lead-time extension needed.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Current on-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for all observed orders (Period 1 through Period 27 concludes list lead_time=0), so promised lead time is reliable. Demand has been in the higher regime for many periods (carry-over insights note sustained high-demand since Period 3). Recent realized demand (Periods 18\u201327) averages ~106 units and shows continued volatility. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time=0 because concluded history consistently confirms 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 (last 10 demand periods) so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std: this adapts to the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing over short spikes. With low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19), this higher short-term forecast raises the base-stock to protect service levels and avoid lost sales while the recent_N choice prevents overreacting to a single extreme period. This also reconciles on-hand + pipeline (14 + 0) against expected one-period-ahead demand (~106): we should expect the engine to order up toward the elevated base stock.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. History shows actual lead time consistently observed as 0 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0), and demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 3 (as previously recorded). Current on-hand = 53, in-transit = 0. Because lead time is reliably 0, use the promised/default lead time so OR backend orders arrive same period. Demand regime is long-established (many periods at higher demand), so rely on the backend's default demand aggregation over all samples to produce a stable (1+L)*mean forecast and corresponding volatility. Using defaults lets the OR engine compute base_stock with the correct q (profit/(profit+holding)) and the capped order cap based on its full sample set; this balances service level versus holding cost given the confirmed 0 lead time and sustained high-demand regime. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 context: observed continual same-period (0) lead time across all concluded periods (P1\u2013P29). Recent demand is in a sustained higher regime since Period 3; early Periods 1-2 were very low and would distort a full-sample mean. Current on-hand = 60, in-transit = 0 meaning no confirmed arrivals scheduled. To avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost, I adopt an L estimate based on observed lead times and use Recent_N demand estimates focused on the sustained high-demand regime. L: use calculate (observed average lead time = 0) so backend knows lead time is effectively 0. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 (use the last 20 demand samples to represent the current high-demand regime and reduce influence of the two very low early periods). This targets (1+L)*mean of recent high-demand samples so base-stock matches current demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture volatility in the same recent window (sqrt(1+L)*std of last 20). These choices prioritize service (profit per unit $19 >> holding $1) while limiting overstock from early low-demand noise. With on-hand low and no in-transit, the OR engine will order up to the recalculated base stock quickly because lead time is 0.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 context: confirmed fast fulfillment (lead time observed = 0 in many concluded periods) and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 3 (carry-over notes). Current on-hand = 100, in-transit = 0 so no arrivals expected this period; we must cover current-period demand plus next periods with on-hand only. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0-period actual lead time. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat: the long streak of high demand (many periods of demand near ~95+ since Period 3) justifies using recent data rather than the distant low-demand samples in Periods 1-2. I choose N=20 to capture the most recent two dozen demands (capped by policy and available history) to get a robust mean and volatility estimate that reflects the sustained high-demand regime. Using recent_N for mu_hat ensures the OR backend targets a base stock matching the higher recent average demand (so we avoid stockouts), while recent_N for sigma_hat increases safety stock for observed variability. This balances high profit per unit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by focusing safety stock on recently observed demand variability rather than diluting with obsolete low-demand samples. No shipments in-transit means the order recommendation will rely on these parameters to replenish from on-hand immediately to meet service targets.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Recent history (Periods 1-31) shows every concluded arrival had lead_time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so promised lead time 0 is confirmed. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 3 (noted in earlier carry-overs) and recent demands (Periods 3-31) remain elevated. Current inventory: on-hand = 42, in-transit = 0. No overdue or missing shipments visible in concluded history. Profit per unit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) implies a high target service level (q \u2248 0.95), so the OR engine should aim to hold safety stock but avoid excessive holding given low holding cost. I select default methods so the backend will use the promised lead time (L=0) and population statistics from all samples to compute base_stock and cap. This balances service (high profit justifies higher z*) while keeping holding cost penalties modest. No explicit adjustments for lead time or demand are needed because lead time has been consistently 0 and the high-demand regime was already recorded earlier.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Context: on-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in many periods (orders placed have arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 3 (average ~95 over many periods). Reconciliation: no outstanding in-transit inventory; current on-hand must cover this period's demand after decision. Given confirmed same-period arrivals and a sustained high-demand regime, I keep L at the promised/default (0) so the OR engine uses same-period replenishment. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose the defaults so the backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples (this leverages the long-run, high-demand data already observed). This balances service level (profit $19 >> holding $1 so target q will be high) while avoiding overcompensation by manually inflating demand \u2014 defaults use full history including confirmed high regime. No new delayed/lost shipments to account for, so no explicit lead-time inflation is needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1269.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 context: on-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (every conclude shows arrived same-period). Demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods; the last 10 concluded demands (Periods 24-33) average 98.0 units with moderate variability. With promised lead time = 0 and no pipeline, we must restock to cover immediate-period demand while avoiding excessive holding cost (holding=$1 vs profit=$19). I choose L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (confirmed repeatedly). For demand level I use recent_N with N=10 (the last 10 periods) because the high-demand regime is sustained and the 10-period mean (98.0) is representative of current demand. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 so the OR backend uses recent volatility instead of diluting with very old low-demand samples. These choices tell the OR engine to target a base stock around the recent mean demand (1+L times mean) with safety determined by recent variability \u2014 balancing high service (avoid lost sales and high profit per unit) against modest holding cost. Given on-hand=80 and no in-transit, the backend will compute orders to top up toward that recent-demand-driven base stock.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 context: on-hand=25, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical concludes consistently show arrivals same-period (lead_time=0) across many periods, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 3 (many periods of high demand). To make the OR engine responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock sensible, I use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using the most recent 20 demand observations (captures the sustained high-demand behavior without overreacting to very old low-demand periods). L set to default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history consistently confirms 0. This choice ensures the base-stock target reflects current realized demand and variability, letting the backend balance the high profit ($19) against holding cost ($1) by using the q-derived service factor; using recent_N reduces bias from early low-demand periods and keeps orders from being excessive given current on-hand and no in-transit units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1428.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. On-hand=73, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 with many concluded arrivals showing actual lead time=0 historically. Recent demand has settled into the higher-demand regime (sustained since Period 3). I see no overdue shipments or lost orders. I choose L.method='default' to trust the promised lead time (0) because every concluded arrival in history confirms 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 26-35) because the high-demand regime is long-lived; the last 10-period average demand = 96.4 units, so with L=0 the review+lead demand forecast (mu_hat) will be set using that recent mean to reflect current demand. I also use sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to capture current volatility from the same recent window. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the confirmed high-demand regime (higher mu_hat) while using recent volatility to set an appropriate safety stock; using recent_N reduces responsiveness to older low-demand samples and avoids overstating variability from early periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_37. On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order from Period_1 to Period_36 had lead_time=0, so actual lead time remains 0. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period_3 (many periods of demands ~80-140). To reflect the persistent high-demand regime while keeping the OR engine responsive to recent variability, I use a recent_N approach (N=20) for both demand mean and demand volatility, capturing the most recent 20 concluded demand observations (focus on the established high-demand regime). L set to 'calculate' so backend will compute the average of observed lead times (which will confirm 0). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat biases orders toward recent demand levels and observed variability, helping the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances the high profit ($19) against holding cost ($1) by targeting an appropriate service quantile while avoiding excessive stock given our low holding cost. This also accounts for on-hand + zero in-transit when computing pipeline coverage for (1+L) periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. History of concluded arrivals shows every order since Period 1 had actual lead time 0 (consistent), and demand has been in a sustained high-demand regime for many periods (large, variable weekly demand with recent spikes: Periods 28-37 demands include several >100 and a 167 in P37). With zero pipeline and immediate demand occurring after our decision, we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of forecast demand. I select L using 'calculate' to confirm the observed lead time from concluded history (backend will compute average observed lead times, which are 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility (gives (1+L)*mean of last 20 demands). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 so the OR backend estimates variability from the same recent window. These choices push the base-stock up to match the persistent high-demand regime while letting the capped order limit control order size versus holding cost. This balances service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost by using recent high-demand statistics rather than the low early-period samples.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 decision. Current on-hand=10, in-transit=0. Product: chips(Regular), profit=$19/unit, holding=$1/unit/period (high profit relative to holding cost => high critical fractile). Historical concluded messages consistently show orders arriving same period (lead_time=0) across the entire history \u2014 confirmed same-period arrivals repeatedly, so promised lead time holds. Demand has been in a sustained high-demand regime since Period 3 (many periods of high sales through Period 38). To make the OR backend responsive to the most recent sustained demand pattern while avoiding over-weighting very old low-demand data, I use a recent-N estimate covering the last 20 demand observations (captures the sustained high regime but is capped at 20). I therefore: keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) so the backend uses same-period arrivals; set mu_hat based on recent_N (N=20) to reflect current high mean demand over the review+lead period; set sigma_hat based on recent_N (N=20) so safety stock reflects recent demand volatility. This increases target base-stock to protect service level given high profit per unit while keeping holding cost in check by using recent volatility and mean rather than all-history mixing with early low-demand periods. No in-transit arrivals are expected to arrive during this period (arrivals become visible only in the next conclude), so the order will need to cover current-period demand plus replenish stock for next periods.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 context: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in concluded history). Recent demand is in a sustained high-demand regime (previous carry-over insight). Current on-hand = 154, in-transit = 0. I use recent demand to capture the current regime rather than the small-sample early history. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since concluded messages consistently show 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 30-39) because the high-demand regime is sustained and the last 10 periods provide a stable estimate: mean demand over P30-39 = 97.5 units (so mu_hat ~97.5 for (1+L) periods). On-hand (154) covers roughly 1.6 periods of expected demand, which is moderate \u2014 we should let the OR backend compute the order to restore to the base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost. For volatility I choose recent_N N=10 to reflect observed variability in the same window (std \u224845.9). These choices give the OR engine an up-to-date mean and variability while relying on confirmed lead-time=0; they help balance high service level (profit $19/unit is large) against holding cost $1/unit by using recent regime statistics rather than diluted early low-demand samples.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_41. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must order to meet imminent demand. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1-40) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many confirms), so using the promised/default lead time is appropriate. Demand experienced a sustained high-demand regime from Period 3 onward (documented in carry-over history). To capture the most relevant recent variability while respecting the sustained high regime, I choose recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (regime_length >>20 so N=min(regime_length,20)=20). This biases the forecast toward recent high-demand behavior and gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period demand estimate and volatility reflecting the past 20 periods, balancing service level (avoid stockouts when demand is high) against holding cost (holding cost is low relative to profit). Using L=default leverages the confirmed 0-period lead time; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat increases responsiveness to recent demand patterns and expected variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2803.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 3 (multiple periods with demand >> early very-low periods); all concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (consistent through history). Current on-hand = 28, in-transit = 0, so we must plan to cover current period demand plus lead. Promised lead time = 0 and concluded history corroborates this, so use default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with supplier behavior. For demand forecasting, use a recent-window estimate to capture the sustained high-demand regime and avoid dilution by the two very-low early samples. I choose recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 demand observations, which reflects the current regime and is within the allowed cap) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This raises the base-stock to meet service-level targets given high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), while sigma_hat from recent data ensures safety stock reflects recent volatility. No overdue or lost shipments detected. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher service levels (reducing stockouts and protecting profit) while keeping holding-cost impact moderate by using a 20-period recent estimate rather than an even longer history.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 context: on-hand=93, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in every concluded period (orders arriving same period), so promised lead time remains valid. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 3 (carry-over insight confirms high-demand avg ~95 over many periods). To ensure the OR engine targets service at the higher recent demand while keeping holding low (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95), I use recent_N statistics so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest stable regime rather than the long-ago low-demand samples. I choose N=20 (regime length >>20, capped at 20) to capture the most recent 20 demand observations, which balances responsiveness and variance reduction. L kept as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. This setup raises the base-stock toward the current high-demand mean while allowing the backend cap and high service-level q to moderate order quantities given the low holding cost.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 start. On-hand=63, In-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so I use the promised/default lead time. Demand has been in the sustained high regime since Period 3 (carry-over insight previously recorded). Recent realized demand (Periods 34-43 = 115,79,118,167,150,11,182,149,87,117) shows current run-rate and some volatility (one low outlier at Period 39). To keep the OR engine responsive to the current high-demand regime while down-weighting older low-demand history, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 (captures last 10 periods including the outlier) so the base-stock reflects current demand over the review+lead horizon. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 so safety-stock sizing reflects recent variability. Using recent_N for both demand mean and volatility helps the backend avoid understocking during sustained high demand while the default lead time (0) aligns with observed punctual arrivals. No overdue shipments or lost orders are evident (in-transit=0 and concluded arrivals have been timely).

=== Period 44 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1740.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. Context: chips(Regular) has on-hand=103, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods (multiple concluded messages), and demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 3 (carry-over insight confirmed earlier). Promised lead time is 0 and recent concluded history continues to support same-period arrivals, so I use the default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with supplier promise. I choose default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all observed demand samples; with L=0 this yields mean and std based on full history which reflects the long, sustained high-demand regime. Rationale for defaults: no new sustained changepoint detected since last carry-over insights, and using full-history estimates avoids overreacting to short-term noise. This balances service level (profit per unit = $19 is high, so we want sufficient stock) against holding cost ($1/unit), letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and cap that optimize the profit vs holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1358.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. Demand history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 3 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0). Current on-hand=86, in-transit=0 so available inventory covers less than a typical recent period of demand (recent demands often exceed 80). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 periods consistently. Given this stable pattern and no evidence of lost shipments, I will use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine uses L=0. For forecasting and volatility I choose default methods so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this leverages the full historical sample set (captures the sustained higher-demand regime) and lets the OR engine calculate base stock and cap balancing the high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). Using defaults avoids overfitting to short recent swings and ensures orders replenish to meet the confirmed higher-demand regime while controlling holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2099.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 context: on-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders report lead_time 0). Demand regime: carry-over history indicates a sustained high-demand regime since Period 3; recent demands remain much higher than Periods 1-2. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1), I choose to (1) treat lead time as the empirical average of observed lead times to confirm the repeatedly observed 0, and (2) base demand forecasts on the most recent sustained high-demand data. Specific choices: L="calculate" to reflect confirmed actual lead time = 0; mu_hat="recent_N" with N=20 to use the last 20 demand observations (captures current high-demand regime and smooths short-term noise); sigma_hat="recent_N" with N=20 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These settings raise the base-stock to match the current high-demand regime while using a recent volatility estimate to avoid over-ordering given the low holding cost relative to profit. With on-hand=48 and no in-transit, the backend will compute base_stock = mu_hat + z*\xb7sigma_hat and cap accordingly; using recent data helps the OR engine react to the confirmed higher-demand regime.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 context: on-hand=31, in-transit=0, profit/unit=$19, holding=$1. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (every concluded arrival lists lead_time=0). Demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods (Periods 3\u201347 show elevated demand vs early periods). No shipments are currently overdue or lost (no outstanding in-transit). Given confirmed same-period replenishment (L=0) and a long, stable high-demand history, I let the OR engine compute base stock and safety stock from all historical samples (default methods). This leverages the full sample mean/variance so the backend will size orders to cover (1+L) periods of demand while the built-in cap limits order sizes. Using defaults keeps parameters consistent with confirmed lead time and the sustained high-demand regime, balancing the high profit per unit against holding cost via the OR engine's q-based service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2318.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (confirmed earlier across Periods 3-12 and thereafter). Current inventory: on-hand=38, in-transit=0 \u2014 no incoming stock scheduled, so we risk stockout this period if demand remains at recent levels. Promised lead time=0 and concluded history consistently shows actual lead time=0, so using default lead time is appropriate. To capture the recent high-demand regime and avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost, I use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (this focuses the forecast and volatility on the most recent 10 demand observations). This raises the base-stock target to reflect elevated demand while sigma_hat based on recent variability informs the safety-stock component so the OR backend can trade off service level against holding cost given the high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1). No lost shipments are evident in concluded history, but because in-transit=0 we must rely on immediate replenishment assumptions by the backend.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=149, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 every period (many concluded messages); demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods (carry-over already recorded). With lead time reliably 0, the simplest consistent choice is to use the default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses all available historical demand to compute base stock. This leverages the long-run high-demand history while keeping parameter reporting conservative and stable. Current on-hand (149) is healthy versus recent single-period demand spikes, and no shipments are overdue. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR backend calculate (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history, balancing service level (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost.
