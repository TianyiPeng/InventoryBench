No concluded arrival history is available to confirm actual lead time; therefore assume possible delays/losses but follow conservative coverage guidance. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so all demand for the upcoming period must be satisfied by a new order. e) Final order logic: aim to cover expected next-period demand while avoiding excessive holding cost ($1/unit) relative to profit ($4/unit). Using the 5-period average (~94) balances service level and holding cost given demand variability. Therefore place an order to roughly cover expected demand for the coming period (rounded to 94 units).",

The most recent actual observation (Period 1 conclude) shows demand=134, indicating short-term upward variation versus the low mid-series values. c) Lead time / orders: Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 with lead_time = 0 periods (ordered=94, arrived=94). This is a single-period observation only; it is not yet a sustained pattern (needs 3+ periods) so I will not record it as a carry-over insight, but I will treat lead_time as 0 for decision-making since we have concrete evidence for Period 1. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. With actual lead_time=0 observed, an order placed now will arrive in time to satisfy Period 2 demand (arrives during Period 2 before demand resolution). e) Order logic: Given high demand variability and that holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit, I prefer to avoid excess ending inventory while avoiding stockouts this period. To balance the recent high observed demand (134) and the sample Period_2 low (88), I use a short-term forecast roughly equal to the simple average of recent observed demand and the sample Period_2: (134 + 88)/2 \u2248 111 units. With lead_time=0, ordering ~111 lets us meet expected Period 2 demand while limiting holding cost exposure if demand falls. Therefore place an order for 111 units of chips(Regular).",

The most relevant recent datum for the current period is Period_3 demand ~=64. The explicit concluded history shows our past two orders arrived same period (ordered and arrived in Periods 1 and 2), so short lead behavior has been observed twice. c) Lead time vs missing orders: both concluded messages indicate orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 arrived with lead_time=0 (ordered and arrived same period). However this is only 2 periods of evidence \u2014 not yet a 3+ period sustained confirmation, so I will not record a permanent lead-time insight. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so nothing available to meet Period_3 demand. Promised lead time = 0 and recent evidence suggests same-period arrivals, so an order placed now should arrive in Period_3 and be available for sale. e) Final order logic: Use a conservative newsvendor-style tradeoff. Unit profit= $4, holding cost=$1/period \u2192 critical fractile = 4/(4+1)=0.8, so we bias toward meeting demand rather than risking lost sales. Given the recent direct demand estimate for Period_3 (~64 units) and limited data, I place an order to cover the expected demand (64 units).
