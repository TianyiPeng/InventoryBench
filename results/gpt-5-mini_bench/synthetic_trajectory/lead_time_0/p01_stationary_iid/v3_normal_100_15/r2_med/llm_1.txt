No sustained regime shift detected. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0 but no concluded arrivals exist yet to confirm actual lead time. There is no evidence of delayed or lost orders. I will therefore assume the promised 0 lead time for ordering decisions but remain conservative about pipeline risk. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. If the supplier delivers with actual lead_time = 0, an order placed now can arrive in this period and satisfy demand. If actual lead_time \u2265 1, the order will not arrive in time and we will face stockout. e) Order logic: Expected period demand \u2248 100\u2013110. Given profit = $4/unit and holding cost = $1/unit/period (overstock is penalized), I balance service level vs. holding cost by ordering roughly one period of expected demand rather than building extra safety stock that would incur holding costs. With no confirmed lead-time issues, order 100 units to satisfy typical demand while limiting potential holding cost if demand is lower or orders are delayed.",
