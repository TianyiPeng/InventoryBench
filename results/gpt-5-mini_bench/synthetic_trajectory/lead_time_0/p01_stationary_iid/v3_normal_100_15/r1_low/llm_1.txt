Recent values show some variability (range 88\u2013133) but no sustained shift; current best single-period forecast = 106 units.\n\nc) Lead-time & missing-order risk: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead_time is unknown. If actual lead_time = 0, an order placed now will arrive in this period and can satisfy Period 1 demand. If actual lead_time >= 1, an order placed now will not arrive in time for Period 1 and we will stockout. No concluded arrivals exist to infer lead time yet. Given the high cost of holding (Holding = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit), excess inventory is expensive.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. No overdue or incoming shipments to cover Period 1 demand.\n\ne) Final order logic: To balance stockout risk vs. heavy holding cost, place an order sized to cover one-period expected demand (conservative if actual lead_time >=1; risk is stockout if lead_time>0). Forecast = 106 units (rounded to whole units). This minimizes expected holding cost while aiming to meet usual single-period demand if the supplier delivers same-period as promised. Monitor the Period 1 conclude message to confirm actual arrivals/lead time and adjust future orders accordingly.",

Recent 5-period sample mean \u2248106, with one observed period at 111. No 3+ period sustained shift evident. c) Lead time / shipments: Period 1 conclude shows ordered=106 arrived=106 and explicitly reports lead_time=0 periods. That confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders placed this decision phase will arrive during the same period's arrival resolution and thus will be available to meet this period's demand). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so all available supply must come from a new order. e) Order logic: Holding cost = $1/period equals profit $1/unit, so overstock is very expensive. Using a newsvendor-style tradeoff (critical ratio = profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5) implies ordering near the median/typical demand. Given recent demands (sample mean \u2248106 and observed Period 1 demand=111, and provided Period_2 sample=133), a conservative forecast around 110 units balances stockout risk vs. high holding cost. Therefore place an order to roughly match expected demand for this period (110 units).",

Demand appears to be rising (111 -> 126). c) Lead time vs missing orders: Orders placed in P1 and P2 both concluded as arrived the same period with lead_time=0, so supplier has delivered with 0-period lead time in observed history. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No shipments pending. With lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive before Period 3 demand resolution. e) Final order logic: Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), so overstock and stockout are equally costly.

Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit per unit ($1), so excess inventory carried to the next period will likely erase its profit (holding cost cancels profit if not sold immediately). That makes overstocking costly relative to stockouts. e) Final order logic: Target supply for the imminent demand only. Use recent short-run average (~89) as forecast and be slightly conservative given variance (one moderate spike recently).
