No sustained regime shift (only 5 samples, no upward/downward trend). c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0, but no concluded arrivals exist to confirm actual lead time; therefore actual lead time is unknown. Because holding cost equals profit ($1 vs $1), excess ending inventory is costly; thus avoid large safety stocks. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. We must cover current period demand (orders placed now may not arrive before demand if actual lead time \u22651). Given high cost of holding, I favor ordering approximately the expected one-period demand rather than stocking extra multi-period safety. e) Final order logic: Forecast current-period demand \u2248 104 units (5-period average ~104.4). Order 104 units to meet expected demand while minimizing costly overstock risk. If actual lead time >0 and the shipment is delayed/lost, stockouts may occur, but holding costs penalize large forward cover more severely than occasional stockout in this setup.",

With lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive in this period and can satisfy Period 2 demand. e) Final order logic: maximize expected profit where profit per unit = $1 and holding cost per unit per period = $1. With roughly symmetric overage/underage cost, order to meet expected demand (use sample mean ~106 units) and subtract on-hand. Order = max(0, round(106 - 14)) = 92 units.

Recent five-period demand (P25\u2013P29 = 86, 81, 96, 119, 100) averages ~96.4 \u2014 consistent with long-run behavior (many past orders/demands clustered near 90\u2013110). There is variability (occasional spikes like 119 and earlier 130), but no sustained upward or downward regime shift over the last 3+ periods. c) Lead time / missing orders: Period conclude messages consistently show arrived = ordered in the same period for many periods; Period 4 previously confirmed actual lead time = 0. There are no overdue or missing shipments in history. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, orders placed now will arrive during this period and will be available to meet period demand (though the arrival is only reported in the next conclude). Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit per unit ($1), so carrying inventory into the next period destroys expected net value for units that are unlikely to sell. This makes overstocking expensive relative to benefits of higher service level. e) Final order logic: Aim to cover expected demand for the current period while minimizing ending inventory. Using recent average demand \u2248 96 units and given the high holding cost relative to profit, order approximately the expected demand (not adding safety stock). Therefore place an order of 96 units.",

Last 5 periods (P40\u2013P44) demands = [110, 98, 85, 98, 111], mean \u2248 100.4. Recent variance shows occasional spikes to ~110\u2013111 but typical demand near 100. c) Lead time vs missing orders: Lead time previously confirmed as 0 periods (carry-over insight from Period 4). There are currently no in-transit or on-hand units, so an order placed now will arrive within this same period and can satisfy Period_45 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, no pipeline safety stock is required to cover transport delay. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals per-unit profit $1, so holding inventory across periods is expensive; avoid carrying multi-period safety stock. e) Final order logic: Order to meet expected demand for this period only, with a small hedge against observed spike risk. Forecast \u2248100.4 units; choose 101 units to balance stockout risk (which loses $1 profit per missed sale) against high holding cost for multi-period carry. No durable new pattern (lead time remains 0).",

To balance stockouts vs. holding cost, target next-period demand \u2248 97 units (rounded from recent avg). Required order = target \u2013 on-hand = 97 \u2013 14 = 83.

Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so any order placed now will arrive in Period 48 before demand. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit; overstocking is costly (holding negates profit), understocking loses profit of $1/unit. With symmetric unit overage/underage costs, the optimal critical fractile = 0.5, so order near the median/forecasted demand. e) Final order logic: Use recent average demand (\u2248102) as the forecast and order that quantity to balance service level and holding cost.

Current pipeline shows On-hand=0 and In-transit=0, so an order placed now will arrive in this same period's arrival resolution and be available to meet Period_49 demand (and will be reported in the Period_49 conclude message). d) Inventory/pipeline assessment: Because profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1 per unit per period, leftover inventory carries full cost that erodes profit. Therefore we should avoid excess ending inventory while making a reasonable attempt to satisfy expected demand. e) Order logic: Use the recent 4-period average (106.25) as the best forecast for Period_49 demand and round to an integer.
