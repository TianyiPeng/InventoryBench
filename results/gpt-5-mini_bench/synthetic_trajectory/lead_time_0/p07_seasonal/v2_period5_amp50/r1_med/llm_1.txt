There is no evidence here of a sustained regime shift. c) Lead time vs missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0, but actual lead time is unknown. No concluded arrivals/history available to infer delays; therefore I must assume arrival could be same-period (L=0) but be conservative about in-transit uncertainty. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0, so only a new order can meet Period 1 demand. Given profit $4/unit and holding cost $1/unit/period, the marginal benefit of stocking an expected unit (expected to sell) is positive. Excess inventory carries cost but there is no confirmed signal of a demand spike. e) Final order logic: Use the historical mean demand \u2248102 as the best point forecast for this period.

In-game observed true demand in Period 1 was 126 (demand=126) but only 102 were supplied (sold=102), indicating unmet demand last period. That suggests demand can exceed our last-period supply and is roughly in the 90\u2013130 range.\n\nc) Lead time / orders: The Period 1 conclude message shows the order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 with lead_time=0 periods (ordered=102, arrived=102, lead_time was 0). That confirms same-period arrivals at least for that shipment; therefore orders placed this decision phase will arrive during Period 2 and be available to satisfy Period 2 demand.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so we currently have no coverage for Period 2 demand.

Ordering 110 balances capturing additional profitable sales while limiting expected holding cost. This order should arrive in Period 2 and be used to meet Period 2 demand.",

Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order placed now will arrive and be available for Period 42 demand. d) Inventory tradeoffs: Profit per unit = $4, holding cost = $1 per unit period. The marginal expected value of stocking an additional unit is 4 * P(sold) \u2212 1, so stocking up is attractive unless probability of sale < 25%. Given observed demand distribution and recent large spikes, a conservative order near recent mean but tilted upward to protect against stockouts maximizes expected reward. e) Final order logic: Forecast ~109 units (recent mean) but increase buffer for volatility and high observed spikes (e.g., 166,184). With lead_time=0 we can order to meet this period's demand exactly. I place an order of 130 units to balance service level (capture profitable sales) versus holding cost risk.",

There were stockouts in some high-demand periods (e.g., P41 demand 184 sold 100), so observed sales sometimes clipped by availability. c) Lead time / pipeline: Concluded history shows lead time consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Current on-hand = 76, in-transit = 0, so no incoming units will arrive after decision (arrivals happen same period but will only be visible next conclude). d) Inventory assessment & risk: With L=0 we must cover current period demand (occurs after ordering). Forecasting next-period demand ~90\u2013100, but volatility (occasionally >180) argues for modest safety stock. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit sold; the marginal downside of a unit ordered that doesn't sell this period is moderate (cost $1 holding vs potential $4 profit if sold). However, excessive ending inventory reduces objective. e) Final order logic: Target to meet expected demand (~95) plus a modest safety buffer to reduce stockout risk while avoiding large overhang. On-hand 76 implies a shortfall of ~19 vs the central forecast; I choose a conservative buffer to cover variability but not create large holding costs.

Longer-run since the confirmed regime shift at P30 the mean is higher (~150 peak episodes), but recent five-period mean is ~93 and shows high variance (a single spike at P41=184). There is no sustained new shift in the last 3+ periods (the values are volatile but not directionally consistent), so do not record a new regime change.\n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: History and prior carry-over insight confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period).
