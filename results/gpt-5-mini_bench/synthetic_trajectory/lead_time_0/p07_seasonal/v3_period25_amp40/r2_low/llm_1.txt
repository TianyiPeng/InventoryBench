Most recent 3 periods average = 173, earlier period was 118. c) Lead time / arrivals: No concluded arrival history available (On-hand=0, In-transit=0). Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead_time is unknown; lost or delayed orders are possible. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand 0, in-transit 0, so unless an order arrives same-period we risk stockout for Period 1 demand. e) Order logic: Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), so excess ending inventory directly reduces objective dollar-for-dollar. Thus minimize overstock while covering likely demand. I balance risk of stockout vs. costly holding by aiming near the 5-period mean but slightly below to avoid leftover inventory given high holding cost and demand volatility. Recommended order covers expected demand for Period 1 while limiting excess inventory exposure.",

The only actual observed sale so far was Period 1 = 138, which is a single-period sample and not enough to conclude a regime shift. I therefore use the Period_2 seed value (153) as the best forecast for this period. c) Lead time / orders: Period 1 conclude shows the Period 1 order arrived in Period 1 with lead_time = 0 periods. That provides one data point that same-period delivery occurred for the prior order; however this is only one observation so I will not record it as a sustained change. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 12, In-transit = 0. Supplier-promised LT = 0; planning rule requires coverage of (L+1)=1 periods of demand. e) Final order logic: Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so overstocking erodes expected profit quickly; target is to match expected demand for the immediate period.

Historical sample list in instructions shows higher variability but the only confirmed realized demands we can rely on are the concluded periods above.\n\nc) Lead time vs. missing orders: Concluded messages show orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 both arrived in the same period (lead_time = 0 observed twice). This supports same-period arrivals; however the carry-over rule requires 3+ periods of consistent evidence to record a persistent change, so I will not register a carry-over insight yet.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 32, In-transit = 0. With expected demand \u2248130 this period, on-hand covers roughly 25% of expected demand, leaving a shortfall of about 98 units.

Lead time: historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201343) consistently show arrived=ordered with lead_time=0; thus actual lead time is confirmed 0 periods and orders arrive within the same period decision (available for that period's demand). Demand analysis: most recent realized demands: P41=58, P42=89, P43=63 (three-period average \u224870). A slightly wider recent window (P40\u2013P43 = 70,58,89,63) also centers near \u224870. Variability exists but the regime is clearly the lower-demand regime. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 26, In-transit = 0. With lead time 0, any order placed now will augment on-hand for Period 44 demand. Economic tradeoff: Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1 per unit per period. This makes overstock costly: each unsold unit next period costs the full profit of a unit. Therefore we should avoid over-ordering and aim to match expected demand closely rather than carry safety stock. Order logic: forecast Period 44 demand \u224870 units (based on recent average). To meet that demand with current on-hand 26, order 44 units. This balances missed-sales risk vs. the high penalty for excess inventory given holding cost equals per-unit profit.",
