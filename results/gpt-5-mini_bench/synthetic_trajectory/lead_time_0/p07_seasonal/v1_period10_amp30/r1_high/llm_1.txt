Mean \u2248 103.9. Empirical distribution sorted = [55,69,80,97,101,109,130,136,140,142]; the 95th percentile is \u2248141 units.

No overdue or lost orders observed. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0 at decision time. With confirmed lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive before demand occurs in Period 47, so we can safely order to match Period 47 demand. e) Order logic: Because lead time = 0, we should order to cover expected demand for this period only (no multi-period pipeline needed). Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) but profit per sold unit is high ($19), so understocking (lost sales) is far more costly than modest overstock. However, with zero lead time we can react next period, so avoid carrying unnecessary inventory. Forecast for Period 47 \u2248 95 units (rounded from recent average ~95). Therefore place an order of 95 units to meet expected demand while minimizing end-of-period holding cost and enabling responsiveness in subsequent periods.",

Longer-run demands fluctuate but the last 5 periods provide the best short-term anchor. c) Lead time and pipeline: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201349) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period).

With lead time=0 and the ability to reorder each period, there's little reason to carry multi-period safety stock. Because understock (lost sale) foregoes a $19 profit while overstock costs only $1 per unit this period (and can be sold later), slight over-provisioning is acceptable. e) Final order logic: Use recent mean demand (~67) as baseline, round up modestly to protect against variability given high unit profit and low holding cost.
