No sustained shift (need 3+ periods of new pattern) \u2014 current best estimate for one-period demand \u2248131. c) Lead time / missing orders: No concluded arrivals observed yet (start of Period_1). Supplier promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time is unknown; cannot confirm any lead-time behavior until a conclude message arrives. Treat actual lead time as uncertain; therefore plan conservatively to cover the immediate (current) period demand. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Because orders may arrive same-period if lead_time=0 but could be delayed if actual lead_time>0, avoid over-ordering to limit holding cost (Holding = $1/unit/period vs Profit = $4/unit). e) Final order logic: Order approximately one period's expected demand (mean \u2248131). This balances service (capture expected sales) against holding cost and the risk of lost/delayed shipments. If lead time turns out to be >0, we will update ordering in subsequent periods based on conclude messages and observed arrivals.",

Demand regime analysis: Recent realized demand (from the environment conclude) shows Period 1 demand = 137 but sales were limited to 131 due to stockout. A broader historical sample provided in the problem statement averages ~131 units (Periods 1-5 average = 131). There is no sustained pattern shift (only one observed concluded period), so do not record a carry-over insight. Lead time vs missing orders: The Period 1 order (131) arrived in Period 1 and the conclude noted lead_time = 0 periods, so current evidence supports actual lead time = 0 (same-period arrival). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Because lead time is observed as 0, an order placed now will arrive in time to satisfy Period 2 demand. Forecast & order logic: Best estimate for Period 2 demand \u2248 130\u2013137 (use the sample mean \u2248131 and the observed Period 1 demand of 137). Given profit = $4/unit and holding cost = $1/unit/period, the marginal expected value of stocking an additional unit is positive unless the probability of selling it is <20%. To balance service level against holding cost, I will target a small safety buffer above the estimated mean to avoid another lost-sale situation. Therefore order 140 units so that arrivals (140) + on-hand (0) cover expected Period 2 demand with modest safety stock. This uses the observed lead time = 0 so these units can meet Period 2 demand.",

Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so any order placed this period will arrive in time to meet Period 41 demand. d) Inventory balance & newsvendor logic: profit per unit sold = $4, per-period holding cost = $1. For a single-period newsvendor with salvage cost equal to -holding (we pay holding on leftover), the critical fractile = Cu/(Cu+Co) = 4/(4+1) = 0.8. Using the recent empirical demand distribution, the ~80th percentile is about 112 units (between 110 and 113). This balances the higher cost of lost sales (foregone $4 profit) against $1 holding cost per leftover unit. e) Final order logic: place an order to cover a high service level given lead time 0 and volatile demand; target \u2248112 units to achieve ~80% service given recent demand distribution.
