  "rationale": "State inference and assumptions: Promised lead time is 0 but we have no concluded arrival history yet, so actual lead time is unknown. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so if actual lead time is 0 this period's order will arrive in time to meet Period_1 demand; if actual lead time >0 we risk stockout because there are no prior pipeline receipts to cover demand. Demand history (150,163,134,139,69) gives a recent empirical mean \u2248 131 and some variability; one low outlier (69) in Period_5 is not enough to conclude a sustained downshift. OR's capped base-stock policy already accounts for demand mean/variance and uses a high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95) so it recommends a relatively large order (191) to protect against stockouts. Decision: follow OR's recommendation and order 191 units. Rationale for following: (1) High profit/low holding cost favors stocking up to avoid lost sales; (2) No concluded arrivals exist to indicate the supplier is late or shipments are lost, so we should not reduce OR's recommended protection yet; (3) The single low demand observation is insufficient to declare a regime change; lowering the order risks large lost-profit penalties if demand returns to prior levels.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time inference: Period 1 conclude shows the Period 1 order (191) arrived in Period 1 with lead_time = 0. That confirms at least one observation of same-period (0) lead time; however this is only one period of evidence so we will not claim a sustained lead-time shift in carry-over insights.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 54, in-transit = 0. Historical single-period mean demand (from samples 150,163,134,139,69) = 131 units. Period 1 demand was 137 (close to the historical mean). Demand is variable (sample std \u2248 32.8) but no clear sustained regime shift is evident.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Review OR recommendation: OR recommends 132 units. OR computed a base-stock using \u03bc\u0302 = 131, \u03c3\u0302 \u2248 32.8, critical fractile q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645, giving base_stock \u2248 185 and order_raw \u2248 185 \u2212 pipeline(=54) \u2248 131. This matches OR's capped output of 132.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision logic and final strategy: Promised lead time = 0 and we have an observed arrival consistent with L=0 for Period 1; with no in-transit inventory and current on-hand of 54, ordering ~131\u2013132 will restore the OR base-stock level and cover expected demand for this period while keeping the relatively low holding cost (holding $1 vs profit $19) tradeoff that justifies the 95% service target. Given the alignment of OR math with observed demand and the confirmed (but not yet repeatedly verified) 0 lead time, I will follow the OR recommendation and order 132 units to bring available inventory up to the intended base-stock.\n\nOperational note: Because lead time = 0 means the order will arrive during this period, the arrival will only be visible in the Period 2 conclude message (read in Period 3).",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows both Period 1 and Period 2 orders arrived with lead_time = 0 periods (Period1 ordered=191 arrived=191, Period2 ordered=132 arrived=132). This confirms actual lead time is 0 (matches promised) for the two observed periods, so I will treat lead time as 0 for immediate planning.\n\nInventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 29, in-transit = 0. Historical sample mean from provided demand samples (150,163,134,139,69) is 131 units/period; recent realized demands in the concluded periods are 137 and 157, implying a recent-average nearer to ~147 and an upward bias vs. the long-run mean. The OR base-stock style recommendation (159 units) already reflects a high critical fractile (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95, z*\u22481.645) and the historical variability; OR's 159 is reasonable but slightly below my assessment given recent two-period demand has averaged ~147 and on-hand is only 29.\n\nDecision logic vs OR: With lead time = 0, we only need to cover the current period's demand (L+1 = 1). Because profit per unit ($19) >> holding cost ($1), the cost of under-ordering (lost profit from stockouts) is much larger than carrying a few extra units. OR's 159 would yield on-hand+order \u2248188; I want a modest buff to better match the recent higher demand trend and to reduce stockout risk given low current on-hand. I therefore increase OR's recommendation slightly to 165 units. This keeps inventory coverage adequate for the period while not creating excessive holding cost.\n\nRisks considered: If demand reverts to the low outlier (69) the extra units will incur holding cost of $1/unit this period, which is small relative to lost profit if we stockout. If lead time were to change or shipments become lost in future, we'll detect that from conclude messages and adjust. No evidence meets the threshold for a sustained pattern shift (requirement: 3+ periods), so I do not record any carry-over insight.\n\nFinal action: Order 165 units of chips(Regular).",

That confirms actual lead time = 0 periods (orders placed now will arrive during the current period and can satisfy current demand).\n\nInventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 58, in-transit = 0. Realized demands from concluded periods are: P1=137, P2=157, P3=136; sample mean = 143.3 units/period, sample standard deviation (sample n=3) \u2248 11.9.

Ordering OR's 126 would leave more excess ending inventory (higher holding cost) without proportionate increase in expected sales. Given confirmed lead time 0, there is no pipeline uncertainty to justify the larger OR uplift.\n\nFinal strategy: Place an order for 105 units so on-hand+order \u2248163 (target base-stock with 95%-fractal safety).

This modestly increases OR's 37 to align with the base-stock target given the confirmed 0 lead time, the computed mean/stdev, and the conservative view that the low Period 6 demand is not yet a sustained drop.\n\nInventory math check: On-hand 158 + order 42 = 200 on-hand after arrival (lead time 0), matching the base-stock target \u2248200 to cover expected demand + safety stock for the next period.\n\nRisks & notes: If low demand persists for 3+ periods, record a downward demand regime in carry-over insights and reduce future orders. If future conclude messages show any delayed/lost arrivals, reassess pipeline and supplier reliability.\n",

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 103, in-transit = 0, so pipeline_inventory = 103. Use observed recent demand (Periods 1\u20137): [137,157,136,100,150,23,97].

This balances maximizing expected profit from sales (high profit per unit) against holding cost ($1/unit).

That means any order placed now will arrive during this period and can immediately satisfy Period 9 demand. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 120, In-transit = 0. With L=0 the decision should cover (L+1)=1 period of demand. Demand analysis: Recent realized demands (P4\u2013P8) = [100, 150, 23, 97, 74], average \u2248 88.8 units; the broader earlier periods show higher values (~137\u2013157) but demand is noisy and no sustained regime shift is evident (last five periods are variable, not a persistent increase or decrease). OR recommendation: OR suggests ordering 67 units based on its capped base-stock; however, OR uses historical samples and promised lead time only. Comparison & decision logic: Because on-hand (120) already exceeds both OR's recommended order (67) and my single-period demand estimate (~89), placing an order would be unnecessary and only increase holding costs. With lead time = 0, an order would arrive immediately, but we do not need immediate replenishment to cover one period of demand. Final action: order 0 units. This minimizes holding cost while ensuring likely demand can be met this period.

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 51, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demands (P5\u2013P9) = {150, 23, 97, 74, 69} \u2192 recent 5-period mean \u2248 82.6 units, with high variance (demand ranged 23\u2013150). Product economics favor stocking (profit $19 >> holding $1), so it is profitable to carry some safety stock to avoid lost sales, but I want to avoid excessive holding from OR\u2019s more aggressive cap. OR recommendation: order = 133 units. OR uses full-history stats and the promised lead time; with profit/(profit+holding)=0.95 it produces a high safety factor (\u22481.645) and thus a large suggested order. Adjustment logic: With lead time = 0 we can top up to meet current-period demand directly; given on-hand=51 and a recent-period demand mean \u224883, ordering ~32 would just meet average demand, but due to high variability and very favorable profit margin I target a higher on-hand to capture upside demand while limiting unnecessary holding. Target on-hand after arrival \u2248 133 units (close to OR\u2019s implied base-stock level) balances capturing high-demand realizations while limiting excess inventory. Therefore order = target_on-hand (133) \u2212 current_on-hand (51) = 82 units. Final strategy: place order for 82 units now (arrives same period) to have ~133 available to satisfy this period\u2019s demand and to cover some variability; monitor next concludes for demand trend confirmation and for any lost shipments.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Historic conclude messages (Periods 1\u201310) show every placed order arrived in the same period it was ordered (e.g., P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, etc.). Therefore actual lead time = 0 (same-period arrival). With L=0, an order placed now will arrive before demand is realized this period and can satisfy Period 11 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory state: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. There is no pipeline inventory to cover Period 11 demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Recent demand has been variable but the 10-period average demand = 107.6 units (period demands: 137,157,136,100,150,23,97,74,69,133). Variability is high and there have been multiple periods with demand >130 (Periods 1,2,3,5,10). Missing stock in past periods has led to lost sales (we saw zero on-hand before some large-demand periods), so under-ordering risks large foregone profit.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Evaluate OR recommendation: OR recommends 183 units using its capped base-stock (it assumes L=promised=0). OR uses the critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/20 = 0.95 (z\u22481.645), which is appropriate given the asymmetry (high profit relative to holding cost). Given same-period arrivals (L=0) the OR recommendation targets a high service level for the current period and limits downside of stockouts.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision & justification: I follow the OR recommendation and order 183 units. Rationale: with lead time = 0 the order can satisfy Period 11 demand immediately; profit per sold unit ($19) is far larger than the holding cost ($1) so it is preferable to err on the side of availability given demand volatility and several recent high-demand periods. Ordering 183 balances covering potential spikes (OR's 95% fractile logic) while capping excessive swings via OR's cap. With on-hand=0 and no pipeline, 183 is my order to maximize Profit\xd7units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost\xd7ending_inventory.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk notes: If demand in Period 11 is very low (<<100), we will carry inventory and incur holding cost $1/unit this period, but with high margin the expected value of meeting high demand outweighs the holding cost. If future periods show a sustained drop in demand (3+ periods), I will record a carry-over insight and reduce target stock accordingly.",

Inventory & demand analysis: Using observed demands for Periods 1\u201311 = [137,157,136,100,150,23,97,74,69,133,113], the sample mean is \u2248108.1 units/period and sample std dev \u224840.7.

Holding cost is low relative to profit ($1 vs $19), so stocking to the safety-stock-aware base is appropriate. Therefore I order 105 units (slightly lower than OR's 111 but exactly matching the base-stock-derived order_raw). This will bring available inventory to ~175 for the period (arriving same period due to confirmed L=0), covering expected demand plus safety stock to avoid costly stockouts.

Therefore an order placed now will arrive during Period 14 and can be used to meet Period 14 demand. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 20, in-transit = 0, so available inventory before arrivals = 20. Demand outlook: recent realized demands (Periods 9\u201313) = [69, 133, 113, 157, 171]. Recent 5-period mean = 128.6 units; sample std \u2248 40.0.

Given L=0, no pipeline uncertainty, and no clear regime shift in demand, the OR cap and base-stock logic are appropriate.\n5) Decision & risk trade-off: Holding cost is small relative to profit, so the downside of slightly higher inventory is limited compared to lost sales.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history through Period 17 contains multiple explicit 'arrived' statements showing orders placed in Pn arriving in Pn (e.g., P1\u2192P1, P2\u2192P2, ..., P17\u2192P17). This confirms actual lead time = 0 periods, so any order placed now would arrive during this same period's arrival resolution and could satisfy current-period demand.\n\nInventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 167, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demands (Periods 13\u201317) were 171, 138, 94, 97, 21 (mean \u2248 104 over those 5 periods). The earlier sample set (Periods 1\u20135) had a mean around 131, and longer history shows volatility but no sustained increase or seasonal spike. Expected single-period demand is on the order of ~100\u2013130 units; even using a conservative high estimate (\u2248130), current on-hand (167) comfortably covers one period's demand plus some buffer.\n\nOR recommendation comparison: OR recommends ordering 19 units. OR uses historical samples and promised lead time; given confirmed lead time 0 and our high on-hand, ordering 19 would only increase ending inventory and thus raise holding cost ($1/unit/period) without materially increasing units sold (we already have enough to meet expected demand). Profit per unit is $19, but ordering now does not increase demand \u2014 it only increases ending inventory and holding-cost exposure.\n\nFinal strategy: Place no order this period (order = 0). Rationale: with lead time = 0 and on-hand = 167, we can satisfy expected demand next period without ordering; avoiding the OR-suggested 19 units saves holding cost of $1 per extra unit per period and reduces risk from inventory carry. Monitor demand next periods; if demand shows a sustained upward regime (\u22653 periods of higher-than-usual demand), revisit ordering to restore safety stock. If demand unexpectedly spikes this period and depletes inventory, we still can place orders in future periods that arrive same period (lead time 0) for rapid replenishment, but current on-hand suffices now.\n",

Adjustment rationale: Recent realized demand has fallen substantially versus the historical sample OR used. Last 5 periods demands (P14\u2013P18) = [138, 94, 97, 21, 40] with the most recent three periods (P16\u2013P18) averaging ~53 units, far below the historical mean 131 OR used.

Expected demand for Period 20 is closer to recent average (~56). On-hand (61) already exceeds that expectation, so ordering additional units now would mainly create holding cost ($1 per unit) while yielding little extra expected sales. Given high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), it can be optimal to carry a small buffer, but the current buffer (61 \u2212 expected demand \u22485 units) is sufficient for typical variance; ordering up to OR's 123 would add ~62 extra units of inventory and incur unnecessary holding cost if demand remains low.

  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201321) consistently show orders arriving in the same period they were ordered. Carry-over insight already confirmed actual lead time = 0. Therefore an order placed now will arrive during this period and be immediately available for sales (no pipeline delay to cover).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & recent demand: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demands show volatility: Periods 16\u201318 were low (97, 21, 40) \u2014 carry-over noted a short lower-demand regime there \u2014 but Periods 19\u201321 show recovery (66, 96 [stockout-limited sold=61], 115 [sold=113]). The latest true demand observations (P21 demand=115) indicate demand can spike back toward earlier historical levels. Given zero on-hand, we must cover at least the likely single-period demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation context: OR recommends 180 units using promised lead time and long-run historical stats with a high critical fractile (q=19/20=0.95 \u2192 z\u22481.645). That caps toward a conservative/high service-level order. OR does not account for the recent temporary downshift (P16\u2013P18) or the rebound in P19\u2013P21.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision logic & trade-offs: Profit per sale is large ($19) relative to holding cost ($1 per unit/period). This biases toward stocking enough to avoid lost sales, but the recent volatility and evidence of a transient demand dip argue against fully matching OR's high 180 recommendation which would create higher expected holding costs if demand remains subdued. With lead time = 0, we can be more responsive in the next period if demand drops again.\n\nQuantitative anchoring: recent highest observed single-period demand = 115 (P21). OR's 180 provides a ~55% buffer above that. A compromise order of 140 covers the most recent high demand plus a modest safety buffer (~+21%) while limiting potential holding costs compared to OR's 180.\n\nFinal action: order 140 units of chips(Regular). This balances high profit per sale (we favor availability) with recent demand uncertainty and confirmed zero lead time enabling quick responsiveness.\n\nImplementation notes: Monitor arrivals and P22 demand. If demand in P22 is high (near or above 140), increase future orders toward OR's recommendation; if demand is low for multiple periods, scale back.

Historical sample mean (given) = 131 units/period. Recent documented regime shift (Periods 16\u201318 avg \u2248 52.7) suggests demand has been lower for a sustained interval, and recent realized demands (Periods 24\u201325 = 104, 57) are below the long-run mean.

Recent sample: mean \u03bc_recent = 76.2 units/period, sample std dev \u03c3_recent \u2248 17.6.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Service-level objective implied by profit/holding costs: profit = $19, holding = $1 gives critical fractile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, z* \u2248 1.645. With L=0, base stock (target on-hand + in-transit) = \u03bc_recent + z*\xb7\u03c3_recent = 76.2 + 1.645\xd717.6 \u2248 105.1 units.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Order calculation: target pipeline+on-hand = ~105 units. Current on-hand = 34, in-transit = 0. Order_raw = 105 \u2212 34 = 71 units (rounded). This brings us to the targeted service level given the recent lower-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost. This order is materially lower than the OR recommendation (139) because OR relies on older, higher historical mean and does not account for the sustained downward shift starting around Period 16.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk checks and operational notes: Lead time = 0 so no need to cover multiple future periods beyond current. There is some variability (\u03c3 \u2248 17.6), so 71 units orders gives safety stock consistent with the high profit/low holding tradeoff. If upcoming periods show demand reverting upward for 3+ periods, we should revise and possibly increase orders; if the low-demand regime persists, we may further reduce order sizes.\n",

However recent realized demand has been materially lower than that historical mean for many periods: Periods 25\u201329 demands = [57, 78, 75, 67, 77] (5-period avg \u2248 71). Earlier carry-over noted a demand regime shift around Period 16; recent periods continue to show lower demand versus the original historical sample mean 131. Inventory & risk trade-offs: Profit per unit is high ($19) and holding cost is low ($1), which biases toward avoiding stockouts, but ordering the full OR recommendation (144) would create large ending inventory given the sustained lower demand. With lead time = 0 we can react quickly next period, so it's prudent to order conservatively now and adjust next period if demand picks up. Decision math: I target roughly one period's expected demand plus a modest safety buffer given high profit. Recent 5-period average \u224871; adding ~40% safety (\u224828) yields ~99 target on-hand.

That policy is risk-averse and aims to avoid stockouts under long-run variability. Step 3 \u2014 Recent demand signal: The last 5 realized demands (Periods 26\u201330) are 78, 75, 67, 77, 108 with mean \u224881 units; recent pattern is materially lower than early high-demand periods. Step 4 \u2014 Decision trade-off: With lead time = 0 we can respond quickly in future periods, so we do not need to pre-build a large pipeline. Holding cost is small ($1/unit/period) but ordering too much now risks tying inventory up across many remaining periods. Given zero pipeline and a recent mean \u224881, ordering enough to cover expected demand plus a modest safety buffer is appropriate. Step 5 \u2014 Final quantity: Order 100 units \u2014 this covers the recent expected demand (~81) plus ~20% safety stock to protect against variability this period, while substantially reducing the risk of large excess inventory compared with OR's 171.

The long-run history is volatile, but the last three periods show a higher short-run mean than some earlier troughs, so I rely on this recent window to set service for the next period. \n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR suggests 171 units using historical averages & the promised lead time. OR's cap and base-stock are generous because it uses longer-term history and a 0 lead time assumption but does not emphasize recent regime evidence. With confirmed lead time = 0 we can respond intraperiod, so we do not need to carry as large pipeline as OR may assume. \n\nStep 4 \u2014 Service level calculation & final order: Using profit = $19 and holding = $1 gives critical fractile q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645.

Adjustment decision: With 53 on-hand and lead time = 0, ordering OR's 115 would produce on-hand availability \u2248168 for Period 36, which is ~1.54\xd7 the recent mean demand (109).

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so no available supply without ordering. Demand analysis: long-run historical sample mean is ~131 (from provided sample), but more recent realized demand has been substantially lower and volatile: Periods 34\u201338 demands = [127, 77, 36, 44, 110], mean \u2248 78.8 with high variance. There was a stockout in Period 38 (demand 110, sold 73) showing occasional spikes. OR recommendation: OR suggests 167 units using promised L and historical stats; OR uses high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95) so it biases toward high service levels. Adjustment decision: I reduce OR's 167 \u2192 140 units. Rationale: (1) Lead time = 0 so orders arrive immediately (no pipeline needs beyond the current period). (2) Recent realized mean demand (~79) is well below OR's long-run-driven recommendation; holding cost is low but nonzero so I avoid overstocking given sustained lower-demand evidence since Period 16 and the very noisy recent sequence. (3) I still keep a meaningful buffer above the 5-period average to protect against demand spikes (140 \u2248 1.8\xd7 recent mean and would have covered the Period 38 spike of 110). This balances profit-driven high service (OR's logic) with observed lower near-term demand and inventory carrying cost. Strategy going forward: place 140 now to satisfy likely demand this period while watching concluded arrivals and subsequent realized demand; if next 2\u20133 periods confirm lower demand, reduce future orders further; if spikes recur, move back toward OR levels.

Therefore an order placed now will arrive in Period 41 before demand occurs and will be available to satisfy Period 41 demand. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so all supply for Period 41 must come from the order placed now. Demand analysis: Recent realized sales (may be censored when stockouts occurred) show high variability: Periods 36\u201340 sold = [36, 44, 73, 81, 107]. The simple average of these five realized sales is ~68 units, but several periods were censored by stockouts (P38 sold 73 with starting on-hand 73; P40 sold 107 with starting on-hand 107), so realized demand could be materially higher than the observed mean. OR baseline = 166 units; OR uses historical demand and the promised lead time and applies a high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 => q=0.95 -> z\u22481.645), which pushes the base-stock up to avoid stockouts. Adjustment decision: Because lead time = 0, we can safely order to satisfy this period's demand without worrying about pipeline uncertainty, so we should be willing to order above the recent mean to avoid costly lost sales (profit per unit $19 >> $1 holding). However OR's 166 is somewhat higher than recent maximum observed demand (113) and may lead to unnecessary ending inventory cost if demand reverts to the recent lower regime. I therefore place a modest reduction from OR's recommendation to balance lost-sale risk and holding cost: order 140 units. This quantity (a) arrives before demand (lead time 0); (b) exceeds recent realized high demands (covers the 113 observed and provides buffer for upside); and (c) limits excess ending inventory relative to OR's 166 recommendation. Strategy summary: follow OR's logic of high service level driven by high profit margin, but trim the order by ~16% to reduce risk of excess holding given recent lower realized averages and potential censoring. If demand demonstrates a sustained upward shift in coming periods, I will revert to OR-sized or larger orders in future periods.",

Historical series shows intermittent low-demand stretches earlier, but the last several periods show elevated, stable demand near ~110\u2013120.

There is no in-transit inventory to wait for.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory position: On-hand = 31, In-transit = 0. Any order we place now will effectively add to on-hand for this period's demand because lead_time = 0.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Recent realized single-period demands (Periods 40\u201346) = [113, 109, 119, 107, 126, 105, 102]. Recent average = 781/7 \u2248 111.6 units/period. Demand has been around ~110\u2013125 in the past several periods (noting some variability). Historical long-run samples are higher in earlier periods, but the last 7 periods are a better short-term guide.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation and its logic: OR recommends 132 units (capped base-stock). Given profit = $19 and holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 (z* \u2248 1.645), so OR is appropriately biasing toward higher service. OR uses promised L (0) and historical variance; its capped value of 132 is consistent with providing a safety buffer above the ~112 expected demand.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision trade-offs: With high unit profit relative to holding cost, avoiding stockouts is valuable. Ordering up to OR's 132 will yield on-hand availability = 31 + 132 = 163 units this period, comfortably covering expected demand (~112) plus a sizable safety stock to avoid lost sales. The holding cost is small ($1/unit/period), so some extra inventory is acceptable. There is no evidence of a new sustained downward regime in the most recent 7 periods; demand has remained moderate-to-high.\n\nFinal strategy: Follow OR recommendation and order 132 units.

Most recent 5 periods (P45\u2013P49) demands = 105, 102, 31, 62, 69 \u2192 mean = 73.8; recent pattern over the last ~10 periods shows many low-demand periods and several stockouts prevented higher sales (which biases observed low sales downward).
