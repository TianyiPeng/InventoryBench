Recent 3-period average (P3\u2013P5) = (48+65+56)/3 = 56.3; full-sample mean = (30+49+48+65+56)/5 = 49.6. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0, but actual lead time is unknown. No concluded arrivals/history to confirm actual lead time; orders placed now may or may not arrive this period. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0.

To maximize expected profit, target expected demand for the immediate period while minimizing leftover. Using recent demand (places more weight on recent higher demand) suggests ordering about 50\u201356 units; full-sample mean ~50.

That is 3 periods of consistent evidence, so treat actual lead time as 0.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 11, In-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during Period 4 and can be used to meet Period 4 demand.

The provided historical sample demand (from problem statement) also lists Period_5 = 56, supporting a forecast near 56. c) Lead time & orders: Carry-over insight from Period 4 confirmed actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period).

From history (concluded demands): P1=50, P2=91, P3=60, P4=50, P5=70, P6=70, P7=106.

This matches the previously logged regime shift to a higher-demand state around Period 36. c) Lead time & orders: Concluded history repeatedly confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P40 all arrived same period). There are no in-transit units and no evidence of lost orders. d) Inventory & pipeline: Current on-hand = 6, in-transit = 0. Since lead time = 0, any order placed in Period 41 will arrive this same period and can satisfy Period 41 demand. e) Order logic: Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit per unit ($1). Carrying extra inventory into the next period destroys the full unit profit for each unit held, so we should avoid overstock and target expected demand exactly. Forecast for Period 41 \u2248 181 units; with 6 on-hand, order = 181 - 6 = 175 units. To be slightly conservative with integer rounding and minimize leftover while meeting expected demand, I place order = 174 units (so total available = 180). This aims to closely match expected demand and minimize costly ending inventory.",
