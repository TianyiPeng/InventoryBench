Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period: Period_1. Recent demand history for chips(Regular) = [30,49,48,65,56] (mean = 49.6, std \u2248 12.24). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so no incoming stock is expected. Promised lead time = 0 and no concluded arrivals available to suggest a different actual lead time, so use default lead time. Given symmetric profit and holding cost (profit = holding = $1/unit), the OR backend will compute service quantile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5; using default demand inputs lets the backend calculate base-stock around the median of the demand forecast. I therefore select defaults so the backend uses all historical samples: L = default (use promised lead time), mu_hat = default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect full-sample demand, and sigma_hat = default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service vs. holding given no evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change, while acknowledging zero on-hand/in-transit inventory requires replenishment from the OR decision.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [30,49,48,65,56], mean=49.6, std\u224811.53. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period_1 order (50) arrived same period and was fully sold, leaving on-hand 0. Promised lead time=0 and observed lead time from concluded history = 0 (Period 1 order arrived in Period 1), so I use the calculated/confirmed lead time. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each) giving service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0), so base stock equals mu_hat; therefore I choose default demand/statistics to let the OR backend compute mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples)=49.6 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)\u224811.53. No evidence of lost or delayed shipments or a sustained regime change, so no explicit adjustments. These settings balance service (target median demand cover) against holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Concluded history shows orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 both arrived with lead_time = 0 (arrived in same period they were ordered). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no available stock to meet Period_3 demand \u2014 must replenish. Use lead time inference: observed lead times = [0, 0] \u2192 average 0, so set L via 'calculate' to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand forecasting use all provided historical samples (30,49,48,65,56). With L=0 the review+lead period = 1, so use default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) = mean \u2248 49.6 units to aim for typical demand. Volatility likewise use default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect observed variability. These choices balance service (target about 50 units) against holding cost (holding cost equals profit, so we avoid large safety stock while honoring recent evidence that lead time is zero). No overdue shipments detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-3 arrived in the same period (arrived=50 on P1 for P1 order, arrived=50 on P2 for P2 order, arrived=56 on P3 for P3 order) so actual lead time appears to be 0. Demand sample set provided (30,49,48,65,56) has mean = 49.6; note observed realized demand in concludes (50, 91, 60) include stockouts so they overstate unconstrained demand variance\u2014I will rely on the provided historical sample set. Given promised lead time = 0 and confirmed actual lead time = 0 across 3 concluded periods, I use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to the long-run sample mean (mu_hat \u224849.6) and lets the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff; with profit=holding the critical fractile is 0.5 so the backend will target roughly the mean demand, balancing service level and holding cost. Using defaults also avoids overreacting to a single high observed demand (Period 2) that was partly driven by previous stock availability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: on-hand=7, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and prior conclude messages (P1-P4) confirm actual lead time = 0. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [30,49,48,65,56] (Periods 1-5). Given the confirmed 0 lead time, no evidence of a recent persistent demand regime shift (last 5 samples vary but show no sustained step change). Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), so the OR backend's risk-service tradeoff using default estimators is appropriate. I therefore use default methods so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this keeps the base-stock anchored to full-sample statistics and leverages the confirmed short lead time to avoid over-ordering while preserving service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start. Recent realized demands (Periods 1-5 concluded) show a sustained upward shift vs the original sample set: recent mean is materially higher, and on-hand + in-transit are both 0 leaving us exposed this period. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior conclusions, so use the promised/default lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (recent_N N=5) so the OR engine sizes the review+lead demand and volatility to the current regime. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given zero pipeline, while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock to reflect realized variability. L is left as default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with observed arrivals. These choices trade higher holding for improved service (profit per unit = holding cost, so we still prefer protecting sales when pipeline is empty).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: mean demand increased from 49.6 (Periods 1-5 historical samples) to 64.2 (Periods 1-5 realized) (+29%), sustained across 5 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $65.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time confirmed as 0 periods (consistent P1-P6 arrivals). Recent demand has shifted higher (sustained higher demand observed through Periods 2-6), so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period fulfillment. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast on the most recent five demand observations (captures the sustained upward demand regime). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=5 so the volatility estimate reflects the latest demand variability. These choices raise the base-stock to improve fill rates under the confirmed zero lead time while keeping sigma based on recent variability to avoid overstock from transient spikes.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time is consistently 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised/default L=0. Demand shows a sustained upward regime: recent concluded demands (Periods 3-7 = 60, 50, 70, 70, 106) produce a clear increase vs older samples; the most recent 5-period mean is 71.2 units. Given profit = holding ($1/$1) the OR backend will set z*\u22480 so base_stock \u2248 mu_hat; to avoid stockouts during this higher-demand regime I set mu_hat using the recent 5 samples (captures the jump including the 106 spike) and set sigma_hat from the same recent window to reflect elevated volatility. This makes the backend order to cover the elevated recent mean while the sigma estimate informs the cap to limit extreme over-ordering. Using recent_N=5 balances responsiveness to the new regime (observed over multiple periods) against sampling noise.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 update: confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals observed same period in conclude messages). Recent realized demand has shifted up and remained elevated since Period 5 (sustained over Periods 5\u20138). Current on-hand = 7, in-transit = 0, so we have almost no pipeline cover going into demand that averages ~78 units over the last 4 periods (Periods 5\u20138: 70,70,106,65; mean \u2248 77.75). With profit = holding cost, the OR base-stock tradeoff equals a roughly 50% quantile but we must ensure (1+L) periods of demand coverage given lead time. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because conclude history firmly confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent regime following the changepoint (Periods 5\u20138) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of those recent samples \u2014 this captures the sustained higher demand rather than diluting with older low-demand data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with the same N to capture the recent volatility (including the large 106 demand spike). This configuration tells the OR engine to size base stock around the new higher mean and its recent variability while respecting the confirmed zero lead time. Given on-hand=7 and no in-transit, this will prompt an order to refill to the recalculated base-stock to avoid stockouts against the now-elevated demand.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (through Period_9) confirm actual lead time = 0 (arrivals matched orders same-period). Demand has shifted upward starting at Period_5 and has been sustained; recent realized demands (Periods 5-9) are higher than the earlier baseline. Given zero observed pipeline and the sustained regime shift, I choose to use the promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime to avoid underordering. I select recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new mean and volatility from the last 5 periods (the detected regime), which lets the OR backend compute a base-stock appropriate for the higher demand while the capped order prevents extreme over-ordering given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 start. On-hand = 33, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1\u201310) consistently show arrivals same period as orders, confirming actual lead time = 0; promised lead time = 0 is reliable. Demand has shifted upward recently: last 5 realized demands (Periods 6\u201310 = 70,106,65,88,47) have mean 75.2, noticeably above earlier sample means, so I use a recent-window forecast. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (captures the new higher-demand regime while remaining responsive to volatility). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices provide the OR backend a base-stock sized to cover the (1+L) review+lead period under the recent higher mean and elevated variance, balancing service (avoid stockouts given high recent peaks) against holding cost given current on-hand stock of 33 and zero pipeline.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 context: confirmed same-period arrivals historically (lead time 0). Recent realized demand has been higher than early-sample means \u2014 last 5 observed demands (Periods 7-11) = [106, 65, 88, 47, 66], average = 74.4. Current on-hand = 10, in-transit = 0, so without ordering we will understock for the coming period given recent demand. I choose L=default to rely on the promised lead time (0) because lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime evident since Period 6; using the recent 5-period mean (1+L times mean) focuses replenishment on current demand levels and reduces stockouts. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility rather than older, lower-variance samples. These choices raise the base_stock to meet the elevated recent demand while keeping safety stock tied to recent observed variability, balancing service level against holding cost. With on-hand=10 and no pipeline, the backend will compute orders to move pipeline+on-hand toward the recalculated base stock.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0 in earlier periods and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 5. Recent realized demands (Periods 5-12) = [70,70,106,65,88,47,66,112], mean = 78.0 over the last 8 periods, indicating the higher regime persists. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so critical fractile q = 0.5 (z* \u2248 0) and the OR backend will target mu_hat as the base-stock. Given the confirmed lead time = 0 and the sustained elevated demand since Period 5, I use a recent_N forecast to capture the new regime (N = 8, periods 5\u201312). This keeps planned orders aligned with the current higher mean (\u224878) while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples. I apply the same recent_N window for sigma_hat so the backend correctly sizes safety stock using the recent volatility. With on-hand and pipeline = 0, these settings will cause the OR engine to order approximately the recent-regime mean (service-level balanced vs holding cost due to q=0.5).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and history (Periods 1-13 conclude) consistently shows arrivals same-period (lead_time=0). Demand has been elevated and volatile since the regime shift detected at Period 5; recent realized demands (Periods 5-13) are higher than the early-sample baseline and this elevated level has persisted for 9 periods. With no pipeline and immediate same-period arrivals, we should set lead time to default (use promised 0). For demand sizing, I use a recent_N estimate to capture the post-shift regime: N=9 (Periods 5-13) which reflects the sustained higher mean and recent variability. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock and safety stock on the current higher-demand regime so the OR backend properly balances lost-sales risk (profit = holding cost) by increasing target inventory while avoiding excessive carry from older low-demand samples. This addresses missing-pipeline risk by ensuring orders cover expected (1+L)-period demand under the current regime.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes through Period 14 show consistent same-period arrivals (orders arriving in same period they were placed) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5. Promised lead time is 0 and past concluded messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 0, so I keep L as default (use promised lead time). Demand has remained elevated and somewhat volatile from Period 5 onward; to capture the current regime I use a recent_N forecast for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 realized demands (Periods 5\u201314) \u2014 this balances responsiveness to the higher mean with enough data to estimate variability. With profit = holding cost, the OR backend will target roughly the mean demand across the review+lead period; providing recent_N for sigma gives a realistic volatility estimate so the capped policy can size safety stock appropriately. This approach addresses the zero lead time (orders arrive same period) and the sustained demand increase while avoiding overreacting to single-period spikes.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0 in earlier periods. There was a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period_5 (higher mean sustained through recent periods). Recent realized demands (Periods 5\u201315) are materially higher than the earliest samples, so I bias the forecast to the recent regime. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 5\u201315 length) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean across the review+lead period (1+L). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=11 to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping holding exposure limited by using only the confirmed recent regime instead of the older low-demand samples.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0). Demand has been elevated in later periods (recent demands P9-P16: 88,47,66,112,118,101,94,88) vs earlier periods; I detect a sustained higher-demand regime in the recent window. To reflect confirmed same-period fulfillment, I set L using observed data (calculate). For demand forecast I bias toward recent demand by using recent_N with N=8 (last 8 realized demands, Periods 9\u201316) so mu_hat covers the (1+L) review+lead horizon using the most relevant regime. I apply recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep safety stock responsive to the higher recent mean while using observed 0 lead time to avoid unnecessary pipeline. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by limiting the horizon to recent data rather than all-time averages.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (periods 1\u201317 arrivals matched orders same period). Demand has been higher in recent periods (notably Periods 13\u201317: 78,83,85,86,90 arrivals with realized demands 118,101,94,88,113) indicating a sustained upward regime vs earlier history. To target service while controlling holding cost (profit = holding), I keep L = default (promised 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current higher-demand regime (most relevant recent periods 13\u201317). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 so safety stock reflects recent volatility rather than older low-demand periods. These choices give the OR backend a (1+L)-period demand estimate centered on the recent elevated demand and recent volatility, balancing fill rate and holding cost given zero lead time and observed demand regime shift.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 decision. Current observable state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201318) consistently show arrivals in the same period they were ordered (lead_time observed = 0 each time), so promised lead time = 0 is confirmed and reliable. Demand has shown a sustained upward regime beginning around Period 5 (higher realized demands persist through recent periods). To ensure the OR backend builds stock to meet the higher recent demand while controlling holding cost, I use L=default (promised lead time = 0) and set demand forecast and volatility using recent data capturing the post-change regime. I choose recent_N with N=14 (covers most recent periods since the regime shift while respecting the N selection rule) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 14 demand observations. This biases orders toward the higher recent demand, improving service and reducing lost-sales while avoiding overreacting to earlier low-demand periods. The approach balances profit vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the base-stock with updated mean and volatility reflecting the sustained higher-demand regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20 start. All concluded history shows actual lead time consistently 0 (every concluded arrival matched same-period order), so promised lead time=0 remains appropriate. Demand exhibited a sustained upward shift beginning at Period 5 (carry-over noted): recent realized demands since Period 5 are materially higher than Periods 1-4. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so upcoming order must cover current period demand as arrival is same-period. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (Periods 5\u201319). Regime length = 15 periods so N=15 (within allowed bounds). This places the forecast and volatility on the post-change data, improving service while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit (q = 0.5 implies median service tradeoff). Using recent_N makes the OR backend compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 15 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 15 samples), which adapts to the confirmed higher mean and volatility and helps balance stock to avoid lost sales while limiting holding costs.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: 21. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages through Period 20 confirm actual lead time = 0 consistently (multiple confirms). Demand has been higher and more volatile in recent periods (Periods ~11-20 show substantially larger demands than initial 5-sample seed). To keep service while controlling holding cost, I bias the forecast toward the recent high-demand regime by using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine's base_stock and cap reflect the elevated mean and volatility seen in the last 10 periods. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concludes repeatedly confirm 0 lead time. This choice reduces stockouts under the new higher-demand regime while the OR engine still applies the profit/holding tradeoff via its z* calculation.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted up \u2014 last 5 realized demands (Periods 17-21) = [113,116,122,111,155], average \u2248 123.4, clearly above the long-run mean. No concluded arrivals are outstanding (no overdue shipments). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 0 in concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime and avoid diluting with older low-demand periods. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 so variance reflects current volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to serve the higher recent demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability; this balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by focusing stocking on the observed elevated demand pattern and avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $110.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23 context: demand has been on a higher sustained regime since Period_5; recent realized demands (Periods 18-22) are high: [116,122,111,155,117], recent 5-period mean = 124.2. On-hand = 7, in-transit = 0, so current visible stock is far below expected next-period demand. Historical confirmed lead time = 0 (concluded arrivals each period). To avoid stockouts the OR should target the recent realized demand level rather than long-ago small-sample means. Therefore: set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent sustained high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands \u2248124.2 units for the review+lead period); set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility around this elevated mean. These choices bias the base-stock upward to maintain service while holding cost and profit are equal (q = 1/(1+1)=0.5), so the backend will choose a median-fill safety factor. Ordering toward the recent mean reduces stockouts given no in-transit inventory and observed 0 lead time, while sigma_hat recent estimate prevents over-ordering from older low-variance periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $117.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals matched same-period orders) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5. Current on-hand=4, in-transit=0 \u2014 effectively no buffer against upcoming demand. Promised lead time is 0 and past concludes confirm same-period arrivals, so I keep L as default (promised). For demand I adopt a recent_N approach to capture the post-change, higher-demand regime instead of diluting it with the early low-demand samples. I choose N=19 (the recent regime from Period 5 through Period 23 is ~19 periods long), so mu_hat uses the mean demand over the last 19 periods scaled by (1+L) and sigma_hat uses the std over the same 19 periods scaled by sqrt(1+L). This raises the base-stock to better cover the sustained demand increase while keeping lead time at the promised 0 to preserve rapid replenishment; it balances higher service level needs against holding cost by using recent observed volatility for the cap calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25. Context: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (multiple confirmed arrivals same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we have no coverage for current-period demand; recent realized demand is substantially higher than early-sample mean. Recent 5-period demands (P20-24) = [111,155,117,121,126], mean \u2248126, showing a sustained higher-demand regime. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand mean I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current elevated regime and avoid under-ordering. For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 so the base-stock safety buffer reflects current variability. These choices give the OR backend a (1+L)-scaled mean and std based on the most recent regime, increasing order quantities to reduce lost sales while capping exposure via the OR engine's cap and the 95%-based safety term to limit excessive holding cost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time = 0 and historical conclude messages (Periods 1-25) consistently show actual lead time = 0, so no lead-time extension is needed. Recent demand is materially higher than the early-sample mean: the last 5 realized demands (Periods 21-25) = [155, 117, 121, 126, 137], mean = 131.2, which is significantly above earlier-period averages. To react quickly to this sustained higher-demand regime, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 5 demands (captures the current elevated demand level). For volatility, I also use recent_N N=5 so sigma_hat reflects recent variability rather than older low-variance periods. L is left as default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms lead time = 0. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock (supporting service under the new higher demand) while keeping holding cost trade-offs managed by using only a short recent window (avoiding overreacting to a single outlier).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: on-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (confirmed repeatedly through Period 26). Recent demand has been well above early-period levels: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 22-26) = [117,121,126,137,90], mean=118.2. Inventory reconciliation: with L=0, current on-hand (42) plus no incoming stock means we must cover this period's demand after ordering; last-5 mean (~118) implies we are undersupplied if demand repeats. Choice of parameters: L set to default (promised lead time 0) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm 0 lead time. mu_hat chosen as recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher demand regime (using the most recent 5 periods which reflect the elevated demand); this produces (1+L)*mean_recent \u2248 118.2 target for the review+lead period. sigma_hat chosen as recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility (demand variance increased with the regime shift). How this balances service vs holding cost: using recent data raises the base-stock to meet higher realized demand and avoid costly stockouts (profit and lost sales weigh equally here, so fulfilling demand is critical), while using a small recent window prevents overreacting to older low-demand periods and keeps holding costs in check. The parameters also acknowledge there are no in-transit arrivals expected (in-transit=0), so the OR engine will compute orders to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the updated base_stock.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. History shows actual lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed in concluded history). Recent realized demand is much higher than the early-sample seed (carry-over previously recorded: sustained demand regime shift around Period 5). Current on-hand = 12, in-transit = 0; expected next-period demand (based on recent experience) is ~116 units so on-hand alone is insufficient and there are no incoming shipments visible. I choose L = default to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded history strongly confirms zero lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime seen in the most recent periods (this gives the OR engine a forecast anchored on current demand levels rather than the stale early samples). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 so the backend measures volatility from the same recent window. These choices push the OR backend toward a larger base stock appropriate for the new demand regime while letting its capped-order logic limit extreme orders; using recent data reduces stockouts while acknowledging equal profit and holding costs (q=0.5) so the backend's safety stock will be moderate.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: observed history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) across many periods and a sustained higher-demand regime established earlier. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so with promised L=0 an order placed now would arrive for Period_29 demand. Recent demand (last 5 periods: P24-P28 = 126,137,90,107,135) has mean ~119 and shows elevated demand vs early-sample means. To capture the higher demand regime while keeping safety stock moderate (profit and holding cost equal so service target is balanced), I use L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples, capturing the current elevated regime. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) so sigma_hat reflects recent variability; this helps the OR engine compute an appropriate z* buffer given current variance. This choice ensures the backend orders enough to cover today's higher expected demand while not carrying unnecessary long-term inventory.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show reliable lead time=0 (confirmed earlier) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period_5; recent realized demands (Periods 25-29 = 137, 90, 107, 135, 161) have a mean of 126 units. Promised lead time is 0 and past concluded arrivals consistently matched orders, so use default lead time to keep backend aligned with supplier promise. To capture the recent elevated demand level and short-term variability, set mu_hat using a recent_N average over the last 5 periods (N=5) so base_stock = recent mean (1+L)*mean_recent = ~126. For sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility for safety-cap computation. These choices prioritize covering immediate demand (prevent stockouts) while the backend's q=0.5 (z*=0) keeps target service/holding tradeoff neutral; recent_N uses the most relevant demand window to adapt to the sustained higher-demand regime and the current zero on-hand/in-transit position.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show arrivals each period with actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders always arrived same period). Recent demand has been well above early-sample levels (sustained higher demands across many periods). With no pipeline and zero on-hand, we must replenish to cover current period demand plus safety. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0), consistent with repeated confirmed 0-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to base the review+lead forecast on the most recent 20 demand observations (captures the sustained higher demand regime and recent variability). Using recent data raises the base-stock to match the new demand level while sigma_hat recent_N uses observed recent volatility to size safety stock. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given zero inventory) against holding cost by reflecting the higher realized demand and its variability rather than diluting with older low-demand samples.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201331) consistently show orders arriving in the same period they were ordered (multiple confirms), so actual lead time remains 0. Recent demand (Periods 27\u201331 = 107, 135, 161, 132, 165) is substantially higher than early-period samples; to align ordering with the current elevated demand regime I use a recent-window forecast. Choices: L: default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time. mu_hat: recent_N with N=5 to target (1+L)*mean of the most recent 5 realized demands (captures the current high-demand regime and reduces influence of older low-demand data). sigma_hat: recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters make the backend base-stock target responsive to the recent high demand (improving fill rates) while sigma based on the same recent window keeps safety stock sized for current variability, balancing profit-per-unit = holding cost tradeoff.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

Carry-over history confirms actual lead time = 0 periods (arrivals observed same period). No overdue shipments. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit = holding = $1), I choose L=default (use promised lead time = 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current higher-demand regime so the OR backend computes base_stock from a more relevant recent mean (~141.8). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects the observed recent volatility (std over last 5 periods). These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while limiting extra inventory from older, lower-demand data.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (multiple periods where orders arrived same period they were placed), so I trust promised lead time. Recent demand has been elevated and more variable (multiple high-demand periods through Period 33), but the change was previously recorded and is sustained; therefore I let the OR engine compute the demand forecast from full history so it captures both baseline and recent spikes. Given profit = holding ($1/$1) the critical fractile is 0.5 (z*\u22480), so using default estimates lets the backend set base-stock = mean demand across review+lead period while the capped order cap will limit extreme orders. This balances service level vs holding cost while relying on the confirmed lead time of 0 and the full-sample demand statistics.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (every concluded order arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has clearly shifted up versus the very small-sample early history; to adapt quickly to the current higher-demand regime I use a recent-window forecast. I select recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 5 realized demands (Periods 30-34), which captures the current demand level and volatility while limiting influence from much lower early-period samples. These parameters push the OR engine's base-stock toward satisfying higher immediate demand (improving service and profit) while the recent_N sigma limits excessive safety stock buildup given the equal profit and holding costs.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Current on-hand=1, in-transit=0. History shows every past order concluded with lead_time=0 (confirmed in earlier periods) and recent periods show elevated demand (sustained higher sales since Period 5). No outstanding arrivals or overdue shipments to account for. Given confirmed same-period arrivals and a long history of realized demand, I select the backend defaults so the OR engine uses all historical samples and the promised lead time: L='default' (use promised lead time = 0, consistent with observed concluded arrivals), mu_hat='default' to let the engine compute (1+L)*mean over all samples (captures long-run average including the sustained higher demand), and sigma_hat='default' so variability is estimated from the full history. This approach leverages the confirmed 0 lead time (so we can rely on same-period replenishment) and uses all demand history to balance the profit-driven service level against holding cost given profit=holding=$1. With on-hand=1 and no pipeline, the OR engine will compute the base-stock that covers current-period demand plus safety stock derived from full-sample volatility; default methods avoid overreacting to short-term noise while honoring the sustained higher demand seen historically.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained evidence from earlier periods). Demand has exhibited higher recent levels but that shift is already captured in the history available to the backend. Given lead time confirmed = 0 and no in-transit stock, I select the defaults so the OR engine uses its full-sample estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat). Using defaults keeps parameters stable, leverages the full historical demand information, and lets the backend compute the base-stock that balances profit vs. holding cost under the known lead time. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while ensuring the engine orders enough to meet current elevated demand.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (consistent across many periods), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been substantially higher and more volatile than the early-sample baseline; to capture the recent elevated regime I base forecasts on the most recent data. I choose recent_N with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 10 demand observations (this balances responsiveness to the sustained high-demand regime while keeping enough samples to estimate variability). Using recent_N will raise the base stock (more safety stock) to preserve service during high demand; sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility so the OR backend sets z* appropriately and the capped order cap prevents extreme orders and limits holding cost exposure.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. Recent demand is well above early-sample levels: many periods (Periods 21-38) show sustained higher demand (often >100 units) so I must raise forecasts versus the very small-sample early mean. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 (no arrivals expected from prior orders). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (arrivals observed same period repeatedly). I set L to default so backend uses the promised lead time (0), matching observed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime evident across the most recent 20 periods (Periods 19-38) while limiting noise from older low-demand samples; this keeps the (1+L)*mean responsive to the current elevated level. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=20) so safety-stock sizing reflects recent demand variability. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts in a high-demand regime (service level important since profit and holding cost are equal, q=0.5), while using a reasonably large recent window to avoid overreacting to single-period spikes. No overdue shipments or lost orders are evident.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since around Period 5 with consistently large demands through Period 39. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover current-period demand immediately (orders with promised lead time 0 arrive same period). Lead time: historical concluded arrivals consistently show zero lag, so use 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time (expected = 0). Demand forecast (mu_hat): use a recent-window estimate to capture the long-running higher-demand regime; I choose recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 realized demands, reflecting the sustained elevated demand since the early changepoint). Volatility (sigma_hat): use recent_N with N=20 to reflect realized variability in the same recent window. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid lost sales in the sustained high-demand regime while the sigma estimate increases safety stock for variability. Using recent_N (20) balances responsiveness to the confirmed regime and smoothing across recent volatility; 'calculate' for L ensures the backend uses the observed lead-time average (expected 0) rather than the promised default if any discrepancy exists. Given zero pipeline, the OR engine will target the base stock implied by the recent demand mean/volatility and capped by the provided cap to limit extreme orders and holding cost exposure.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded periods show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (arrivals matched orders each period). Recent demand has been elevated: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36-40) = [180,199,171,179,176], average \u2248181 and moderate volatility. Given profit = holding ($1/$1) the critical fractile q = 0.5 (z\u22480) so the OR engine will target roughly the forecasted demand across the review+lead window. I select L=default to use the promised/confirmed lead time of 0. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=5 to anchor the base-stock to the most recent high-demand regime (captures current mean \u2248181). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility (captures recent std dev ~9\u201310). This keeps target inventory aligned with the latest realized demand while avoiding excess stock from older low-demand periods; using recent_N reduces stockouts during this sustained high-demand regime while limiting holding cost by not over-reacting to older samples.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 context: on-hand=39, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Recent realized demand has a sustained higher regime since ~Period 21 (many periods with demand >100, most recent demands 142\u2013181). With profit=holding, the critical service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0) makes the OR engine target the estimated demand across the review+lead horizon (mu_hat). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (confirmed historically as 0 periods). For demand forecast I detect a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 21; I use recent_N with N=20 (regime length >20, cap 20) so mu_hat reflects the mean of the most recent 20 demand observations and sigma_hat uses the recent 20 observations to capture current volatility. This gives the OR engine a rolling, up-to-date estimate that matches the current high-demand environment and avoids under-ordering. Given q=0.5 (z*=0), this approach emphasizes matching expected demand while sigma_hat (recent) feeds into the cap to prevent extreme over-ordering and limit holding costs. Current on-hand (39) plus the order computed from these parameters will be reconciled by the backend against pipeline; since in-transit=0 and lead time=0, ordered units will arrive same period and help cover immediate demand.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arriving same period across many periods), so use the promised/default lead time. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime compared to very early samples (already recorded in carry-over insights), so I will let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all concluded demand samples (default) which incorporates the full realized demand history. With Profit=$1 and Holding=$1, the critical ratio q = 0.5 implies z*\u22480; using default statistics lets the backend set base stock close to the mean demand across the review+lead period, balancing service level and holding cost. Since on-hand + pipeline = 0, the OR engine will order up to the computed base stock. This approach is robust given confirmed lead time=0 and no new sustained changepoint detected.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (multiple periods). Recent demand is well above early-sample means (sustained higher regime noted previously). No shipments are overdue. I set L to default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded history consistently shows same-period arrivals. To capture the sustained elevated demand regime and keep service while limiting excessive holding cost, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (focus on the latest 5 demand observations to reflect the current higher mean and recent volatility). This gives the OR engine a demand forecast that reacts to the higher recent mean while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability so the base-stock and cap reflect current risk; using recent data avoids diluting the higher demand signal with older, lower-demand periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period_45 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed in earlier carry-over). Demand has clearly shifted to a higher sustained regime versus the earliest samples (large, persistent demands over many periods). I therefore keep L as default (promised/confirmed 0). For demand sizing I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the OR backend on the most recent regime (last ~20 concluded periods show higher averages and volatility than early history). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize meeting the elevated service-level needs from the sustained higher demand while avoiding excess inventory buildup based on older low-demand periods.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand is elevated \u2014 last 5 period demands (P41-P45) = [142,193,166,181,201], mean=176.6, indicating a sustained high-demand regime vs early history. I choose L=default to trust the confirmed 0-period lead time (promised=0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the base-stock on the current high-demand regime; with L=0 mu_hat becomes (1+L)*mean_recent = 176.6. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=5 to capture current volatility (std ~21). These settings prioritize service (higher mu_hat) to avoid lost sales given zero lead time and high recent demand, while sigma_hat recent_N keeps safety stock aligned to observed short-run variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $111.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 decision. Context: on-hand=33, in-transit=0, no arrivals visible this period. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders arrived same period across many periods), so promised lead time remains valid. Demand has been in a higher regime for many periods (sustained elevated weekly demands ~120-200 from mid-horizon onward). To capture the recent, sustained higher demand I use recent_N methods that focus the backend forecast on the most recent demand regime. Specifically: L set to default to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; mu_hat set to recent_N (N=20) to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 20 demand observations, which reflects the sustained higher-demand regime and avoids dilution by older low-demand samples; sigma_hat set to recent_N (N=20) to allow the OR engine to size safety stock using recent volatility, improving service during this high-demand regime. This balances profit vs holding cost by aligning base-stock to current demand levels (higher \u03bc\u0302) while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock buildup. No overdue shipments are visible (in-transit=0).

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals across many periods confirm lead time = 0 (see earlier periods); therefore use default lead time to keep backend aligned with supplier promise. Recent realized demand is substantially higher than the early-sample baseline and the most actionable information is the recent 20-period window (captures the sustained high-demand regime seen since ~Period 29\u201340+). I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to forecast (1+L)-period demand and its volatility from the most relevant recent regime. This raises the base stock to match current elevated demand while avoiding overreacting to very short noise spikes. With profit=holding, the backend\u2019s critical fractile is 0.5 (z*=0), so setting mu_hat from recent demand centers ordering on the elevated mean; using recent sigma_hat ensures the OR cap limits extreme orders driven by transient variance. This balances service level (reduce frequent stockouts given on-hand=0) against holding cost risk at the current high-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $165.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and historical conclude messages across many periods consistently show arrived=ordered within the same period, so actual lead time remains confirmed at 0. Demand has been elevated and relatively stable at a higher level for many recent periods (multiple periods with demand ~140-207), so I bias the forecast toward the most recent regime rather than the tiny initial sample. I choose L=default to keep the promised lead time of 0 (well-supported by concluded arrivals). For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=20) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of the last 20 demand samples \u2014 this captures the recent high-demand regime and avoids overweighting early low samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These settings encourage the OR backend to hold inventory commensurate with current demand while the short lead time keeps pipeline requirements minimal, balancing service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given profit and holding cost parity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $169.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (multiple periods). Demand has moved to a higher regime recently (sustained higher demands in the most recent periods). Because lead time is confirmed 0, I keep L as default (promised lead time). To react to the recent sustained upward demand while avoiding over-weighting distant low-demand history, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent regime). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 so the backend measures variability from the same recent window. These settings push the OR engine to raise the base-stock to cover the elevated short-run mean and its variability (improving service and profit given profit and holding costs are equal) while keeping exposure to older low-demand periods limited. With on-hand and pipeline at zero, this will prompt orders sufficient to meet (L+1) periods of the recent higher demand signal.
