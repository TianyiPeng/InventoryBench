Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are: [30,49,48,65,56] (mean ~49.6). Promised lead time is 0 and there are no 'Period X conclude' messages to infer a different actual lead time or lost shipments. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), implying a critical fractile q=0.5 (z\u22480) so the OR backend will center orders on the demand forecast. Given no evidence of a changepoint in demand or lead time, use default calculations so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat. This is conservative and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the system begins to reveal actual lead times and arrivals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period: Period_2. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. History shows Period_1 order (50) arrived same period (arrived=50, lead_time=0) and demand in Period_1 was 50. Use observed lead-time data to set L so the OR engine uses realized performance rather than promised. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (currently 0). Demand history (samples: 30,49,48,65,56; mean=49.6) is representative; with L=0 use default mu_hat so backend sets (1+L)*mean across all samples. Volatility is typical across samples; use default sigma_hat so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to the full-sample mean/variance while letting the OR engine compute the exact safety-stock tradeoff (profit and holding cost are equal, so q=0.5). These choices are conservative given limited concluded periods and no sustained changepoint evidence, and they avoid overreacting to single-period noise or potential lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $45.00, Daily Holding Cost: $5.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3: Recent concluded data shows demand sold = 50 (P1) and 45 (P2). On-hand=5, in-transit=0 so available stock is very low vs typical demand (~47.5 recent average). Both concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so actual lead time appears to match promised 0. I set L using calculate to confirm observed lead-time behavior. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the historical samples (the engine has access to the full sample set). This balances service level (profit and shortage cost symmetric given profit=holding) while avoiding overstock given holding cost equals profit. With on-hand=5 and expected demand ~47\u201350, the backend will likely order up to the computed base-stock to cover the (L+1) period demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1; P2 order arrived P2)

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in Period 3 conclude: P1 and P2 orders arrived same period). Recent demand observations (from concludes) have been 50, 45, 86 \u2014 a spike in Period 3 but not sustained for 3+ periods, so no confirmed regime change. Promised lead time = 0 and concluded evidence matches it, so use default lead time. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this leverages all available history without overreacting to the single high-demand spike in Period 3. With profit = holding, the backend target service quantile is 0.5 (z*\u22480), so default forecasts keep base-stock near historical mean to balance stockouts vs. holding. No overdue shipments or lost orders are evident.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (carry-over insight). Recent demand history shows variability (one large spike in Period_3) but not a sustained regime change. Given confirmed 0-period actual lead time and no clear sustained shift in mean/variance, use default methods so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps ordering responsive to same-period arrivals while avoiding overfitting to the single spike in Period_3. Default sigma allows the engine to capture observed variability; defaults balance service level vs holding cost under equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 in Periods 1\u20135 (orders placed arrived same period). Recent concluded demand history shows volatile demand (concluded demands: P1=50, P2=45, P3=86, P4=45, P5=57) but no sustained regime shift of 3+ periods. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by concluded arrivals, so use the default lead-time setting. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set; this leverages all available data while keeping parameters simple given no strong evidence of a new regime. With profit = holding cost, critical fractile q = 0.5 (z*\u22480), so base-stock will center around the demand forecast; using default uncertainty (sigma_hat default) lets the capped policy temper orders to avoid excess inventory given equal profit/holding. This approach addresses the zero observed lead time, accounts for recent demand variability without overreacting to one-off spikes, and keeps exposure to holding cost limited.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 context: on-hand=4, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand (Periods 2\u20136) = [45,86,45,57,50], recent average \u224856.6 units/period and recent volatility elevated by the Period_3 spike (86). Promised lead time = 0 and prior conclude messages (Period 1\u20136) confirm same-period arrivals; no new evidence of lost shipments or longer lead time. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time=0 (confirmed historically). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 2\u20136) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime which shows a higher mean (~56.6) than the older samples; with L=0 mu_hat becomes (1+L)*recent_mean = recent_mean. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=5 to capture current volatility (including the P3 spike) so the OR backend will inflate safety stock appropriately. This choice balances service level (avoid stockouts given recent ~56/day demand) against holding cost: using recent data increases target base-stock and safety buffer but is justified by repeated high demand in recent periods. With on-hand=4 and no in-transit, the backend will likely order up to the computed base stock to cover same-period demand and uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start. On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P7) consistently show arrivals with lead_time=0 (confirmed in Period 3 insight). Demand has been variable (recent demands: 50,45,86,45,57,50,50) but no sustained (>3 periods) regime shift; spikes (e.g., Period 3) are isolated. Promised lead time=0 matches observed arrivals; no overdue or lost shipments visible. I choose L='default' to use the promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose 'default' so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively \u2014 this leverages all available demand history without overfitting to an isolated spike. Given profit=holding, the backend will target a median service level (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), so keeping mu_hat/sigma_hat as defaults balances service vs. holding cost in the absence of a sustained demand or lead-time shift.

Daily Profit: $53.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $53.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (arrivals observed same period for prior orders). Recent demand has shifted versus the very early spike (Period_3 = 86); the most representative recent window is Period_4\u2013Period_8 with demands [45,57,50,50,64], mean = 53.2 units and population std \u2248 6.6 units. Using L = promised (0) is supported by concluded messages. I choose mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods (recent_N, N=5) to capture the current demand regime (removes influence of the isolated high spike at Period_3). I choose sigma_hat also using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings give the OR backend a (1+L)-period forecast centered on recent average demand (~53 units) and modest volatility (~6.6), which balances service (avoid stockouts given recent demand) against holding cost (profit and holding cost are equal, so extreme safety stock is penalized). No overdue shipments or lost orders are detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 decision. Recent realized demand (Periods 5-9 = 57,50,50,64,31) shows mean ~50.4 with moderate volatility; on-hand=23, in-transit=0 and prior conclude messages confirm actual lead time=0 (orders arrive same period). No shipments are overdue. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 vs $1) so the critical fractile q = 0.5 (z*\u22480) \u2014 the OR engine will target roughly the forecasted demand across review+lead. To keep service while avoiding excess holding given current lower recent average demand I use a recent_N forecast: mu_hat based on the last 5 periods (captures the post-spike drop after Period 3) and sigma_hat likewise on the last 5 to reflect current volatility. L set to default (promised lead time 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirmed same-period arrivals. This combination gives the OR backend a demand forecast that is responsive to the recent regime and keeps base-stock near the recent mean, limiting excess inventory given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 start: on-hand=23, in-transit=0. Recent observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (previous carry-over). Demand over the most recent 5 concluded periods (P6\u2013P10 = 50, 50, 64, 31, 28) shows a lower and more variable regime than earlier spikes; mean_recent_5 = 44.6. With promised lead time 0 and profit=holding ($1/$1) the critical fractile q = 0.5 (z*\u22480), so the OR backend will target roughly the (1+L)*mean demand. Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat (and sigma_hat) focuses the forecast on the most recent regime (captures the downward shift after the P8 spike). Given on-hand 23 and no in-transit, this will let the OR engine compute an order that balances service vs. holding cost for the current lower-demand regime. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift since all recent orders concluded same-period.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 decision. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we have no coverage for upcoming demand. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods (earlier carry-over). Recent concluded demands (Periods 1\u201311) average \u224851.8 units/period with visible variability (demands range 28\u201386). With promised lead time = 0 and confirmed same-period arrivals, using the backend defaults is appropriate: let L use the promised lead time (default = 0) and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample set. This yields (1+L)\xd7mean demand = ~52 units target coverage for the review+lead period and a sigma consistent with full-sample variability. Given profit = holding cost, the critical fractile q = 0.5 (z* = 0) so the backend will center base-stock at the mean; using defaults avoids overfitting to short-term spikes (e.g., Period 3 and Period 11 spikes) while ensuring the immediate order replenishes one period of expected demand. I therefore select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes parameters using all observed concluded demand and lead-time data.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 decision. History (Periods 1\u201312) shows arrivals always same-period; previous carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 0. Recent demand history (Periods 1\u201312) has mean \u224852.75 units/period and std \u224815.70. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we need to replenish to cover this period's demand. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by observed arrivals, so use default lead time. With profit = holding, the OR backend will target a 50% service quantile (z*=0) when computing base_stock; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set, yielding a baseline replenishment that balances service vs holding costs without overreacting to recent variability. If lead-time or sustained demand shifts appear in future concluded periods, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit method.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 start. Recent history (Periods 1\u201313) shows consistent same-period arrivals: every concluded message reports arrived=ordered and lead_time=0; earlier carry-over insight already recorded lead_time=0 at Period 3. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no pending arrivals will cover Period_14 demand. Demand history (Periods 1\u201313) has mean \u224856.6 and std \u224819.7. There is a single large spike at Period_13 (demand=103) but this is isolated (only one period) and does not meet the 3+ period threshold for a sustained regime change, so I will not treat it as a permanent shift. Given confirmed 0 actual lead time and no sustained changepoint in demand, use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample set. This balances service (captures overall demand variability) against holding cost; keeping L at promised/confirmed 0 avoids over-ordering for delayed shipments that are not occurring.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 decision. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-time observations (Periods 1-14) consistently show arrivals same period as orders, so promised lead time=0 is still valid. Recent demand (Periods 11-14 = 64,63,103,85) is materially higher than earlier history; I therefore treat the demand regime as shifted beginning Period 11 and base forecast on the most recent 4 periods. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period delivery. For mu_hat I choose recent_N (N=4) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of the last 4 samples, capturing the new higher demand level while avoiding dilution by older low-demand periods. For sigma_hat I choose recent_N (N=4) to reflect the elevated volatility seen in the recent regime. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service (reducing lost sales during this sustained higher demand) while keeping holding exposure constrained by using a short recent window rather than the full history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg increased from 47.1 (Periods 1-10) to 78.8 (Periods 11-14) (+67%).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical arrivals show lead time reliably 0 (confirmed earlier), and no overdue or missing shipments in recent history. Demand history P1\u2013P15 sums to 906 over 15 periods \u2192 mean demand = 60.4 units/period; sample std \u2248 21.44. I choose to use the promised/default lead time (L=default) because concluded periods consistently show lead_time=0. For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) \u2248 60.4 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2248 21.44. This balances service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine set the base-stock from observed overall mean and variability; with profit=holding cost the critical ratio is 0.5, so default statistics give a conservative safety stock reflecting real variability. No evidence of new sustained regime changes since prior carry-over notes, and no delayed shipments to adjust lead time upwards.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: confirmed same-period fulfillment historically (lead time observed = 0) and recent sustained higher demand since Period 11. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover Period 17 demand. Historical demand (Periods 11-16) = [64,63,103,85,85,79], mean \u2248 79.83, sample std \u2248 15.0. This reflects the demand regime identified at Period 15 (mean up from ~47 to ~79+). Lead time decision: use default (promised = 0) because concluded history confirms 0-period lead time. mu_hat decision: use recent_N with N=6 (the confirmed new regime from Periods 11\u201316); backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples (~79.8 units) which aligns base-stock to the higher demand. sigma_hat decision: use recent_N with N=6 to capture the elevated volatility in the new regime (std \u224815 units, so sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u224815). Given profit = holding, q=0.5 so target z*\u22480 and base_stock\u2248mu_hat; using recent samples prevents dilution by the older low-demand periods and ensures the OR engine orders enough to meet the sustained higher demand while not overreacting to a single extreme (we used 6 periods, the observed regime length).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period_11 (Periods 11-17 consistently elevated). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current period demand plus review+lead coverage. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period across history), so use a lead-time estimate that reflects observed data. I set L using 'calculate' to let the backend confirm average observed lead time (which will be 0). Demand forecast uses recent_N with N=7 (periods 11-17) because a clear regime shift began at Period_11 and the regime length is 7 periods; N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) = 7. Using recent_N focuses the base-stock on the new, higher-demand regime rather than diluting with older low-demand data. Sigma uses recent_N N=7 as well to capture recent volatility. These choices instruct the OR engine to size base-stock for the elevated mean and current variability while keeping lead-time conservative (observed 0), balancing profit-driven service level against holding cost given holding cost equals profit ($1/$1).

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so keep L as default (promised lead time=0). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 11 (Periods 11-18 demands: 64,63,103,85,85,79,104,96 \u2014 clearly elevated vs. Periods 1-10). To capture the post-changepoint demand level I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime. Regime length = 8 (Periods 11-18), so I choose N=8 (fits rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). Using recent_N focuses the OR backend on the higher mean and volatility observed since Period 11, increasing target base-stock to reduce stockouts during this sustained higher-demand period while accepting holding cost tradeoffs.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20 start: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (arrivals matched orders each period). Demand has shifted up starting Period_11; the recent regime (Periods 11-19) shows substantially higher demand (mean \u2248 88 units) versus earlier mean \u2248 50.6. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0, confirmed by arrivals). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the current high-demand regime so mu_hat = (1+L) \xd7 mean of the last 9 demand samples (Periods 11-19) to capture the sustained elevated demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with the same N=9 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service (higher base stock) in the confirmed higher-demand regime while using recent volatility so the OR backend's cap still limits over-ordering given holding cost = profit.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders from P1..P20 all arrived same period), and a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 11 (higher demand since P11). I therefore keep L at the promised/confirmed value (0). For demand I target the post-shift regime: use recent_N over the last 10 periods (Periods 11-20) where mean demand = 90.9 units; with L=0 this yields mu_hat \u2248 (1+L)*mean = 90.9. I set mu_hat method to recent_N, N=10 to focus the forecast on the sustained higher-demand regime. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=10, since variability increased with the new regime; sample std over Periods 11-20 \u2248 18.9, and with L=0 sigma_hat \u2248 18.9. These choices (recent, regime-focused estimates) give the OR backend an updated base-stock aligned to the confirmed higher-demand regime while preserving the low lead time; this balances service (avoid stockouts given zero observed lead time and higher demand) against holding cost by not inflating estimates with older low-demand data.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 decision. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 11 (Periods 11\u201321 show consistently elevated demand: samples 64,63,103,85,85,79,80,84,85,89,91,114,116,114 \u2014 strong sustained increase vs. Periods 1\u201310). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover this higher regime immediately. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded history (multiple arrivals same period), so use the promised/default lead time. To capture the sustained higher mean and the increased variability, I use recent_N over the most recent regime (Period 11 onward). Regime length ~11 periods, so N=11 (meets the min 3 and cap rules). Using recent_N for mu_hat ensures the base_stock reflects (1+L)*recent mean (and with profit=holding, service quantile=50%, base_stock\u2248mu_hat). Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures recent volatility for the OR engine's cap calculation. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the new high-demand regime) while not overstocking on older low-demand data.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time reliably 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 11 (carry-over insight): recent demands (P11\u2013P22) average \u224895.5 units with elevated variance and consistent high sales (many periods with stockouts). With profit=$1 and holding=$1, the critical fractile is 0.5 (z\u22480) so the OR backend will target roughly the forecasted demand across review+lead. I therefore set L to default (promised 0) because concluded evidence supports 0 lead time. For demand and volatility I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the sustained higher mean and recent variability: N=12 (Periods 11\u201322). This gives the backend a forecast (mu_hat) that reflects the elevated demand regime and a sigma_hat that reflects recent volatility \u2014 together they will raise order quantities enough to reduce frequent stockouts while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost parity with profit. No shipments appear overdue or lost.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (observed repeatedly since Period 1). Demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning at Period 11 (Periods 11-23 consistently higher than Periods 1-10). Recent demand is materially larger and more relevant for setting target inventory. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0, which matches observed). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 11-23) to capture the confirmed demand regime shift: regime length = 13 periods (P11\u2013P23), so N = 13 per the rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3). This places the base-stock target and safety-stock on the elevated recent mean and volatility, improving service during the higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods. With profit=holding cost, the OR backend will set z accordingly; using recent demand statistics reduces stockouts under the new regime while limiting excess holding from older low-demand data.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 11 (previous carry-over), and the last five concluded demands (Periods 20-24 = 116, 114, 123, 117, 174) show elevated average and increased volatility with a large spike in Period 24. No shipments are overdue or missing. To respond quickly to the recent elevated demand while keeping holding cost in check, I keep L at the promised/default (0) and set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine targets the recent higher mean (captures the recent spike influence). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased short-term volatility; this raises safety stock and helps avoid lost sales during the recent high-demand periods while keeping orders responsive given zero lead time.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26 context: on-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 periods (orders placed have always arrived same period). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 11 (sustained elevated demand through Period 25). I therefore keep L as the promised/default lead time (0) because concluded history confirms it. For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach anchored on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 11\u201325, regime length = 15) so the backend computes mu_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 15 samples; this captures the sustained higher mean and prevents under-ordering. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with the same N=15 to reflect current volatility in the high-demand regime. These choices balance service (reduce frequent stockouts given higher recent demand) against holding cost by limiting the window to the confirmed new regime rather than all historical low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $104.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27 decision. History shows consistent same-period arrivals: every concluded period from P1\u2013P26 reports lead_time=0 when arrivals occurred, so actual lead time = 0 is well supported. Demand shifted up at Period_11 and has remained elevated from Period_11\u2013Period_26 (16 periods of higher demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we need orders to cover current period demand after decision. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand I use a recent_N forecast over the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 11\u201326, 16 samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 16 samples; this captures the sustained higher mean and avoids dilution by low pre-shift periods. I also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=16 to reflect volatility in the current regime (including large spikes in P24 and P26). These choices push the backend toward a higher base-stock and a wider safety buffer, prioritizing service (profit $1 vs holding $1) while acknowledging holding cost parity.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period_11 (already recorded). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must order to cover current period demand as arrivals are same-period (lead time confirmed 0). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=17) to capture the elevated regime from Period_11 through Period_27 (17 periods) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 17 demands). I also use recent_N (N=17) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility rather than diluting with older low-demand data. This focuses the OR engine on the higher demand regime so base-stock and caps better match current sales while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $91.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: on-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show arrivals same period (lead time = 0 observed across many periods), so promised lead time = 0 is still supported. Demand history shows the earlier sustained regime shift (Periods 11-14 upward) already recorded in carry-over insights; no new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time in the most recent periods (Periods 24-28 show high but variable demand, not a new sustained regime). Given confirmed same-period arrivals and no new sustained signal, use default calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level versus holding cost. Current low on-hand (9) and zero in-transit mean the OR engine will likely order up to computed base stock to cover demand for the review+lead period.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historically actual lead time confirmed as 0 (arrivals matched same period). Recent demand (Periods 25-29 = 115,160,141,100,147) is substantially higher than the prior elevated regime (Periods 11-24 avg \u224878.8). This 5-period high-demand run is sustained (>=3 periods) so I treat it as a new regime starting Period 25. No overdue shipments or in-transit inventory to offset upcoming demand, so we must increase the forecast used by the OR engine to avoid stockouts. Because lead time is 0, the review+lead period length is (1+L)=1. I select L="default" (trust promised lead time=0), and use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (N = regime length =5). This focuses the backend forecast on the most relevant recent data; with profit=holding, target service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0) so the OR base stock will align closely with the recent mean demand, reducing stockouts while limiting excess holding. Using recent volatility (sigma_hat recent_N=5) ensures safety-cap calculation reflects current demand dispersion.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: avg increased from 78.8 (Periods 11-24) to 132.6 (Periods 25-29) (+68%).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 decision. Context: chips(Regular) profit=$1/unit and holding=$1/unit (symmetric costs \u2192 target service quantile q=0.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders placed arrived same period through Period 30). Demand has exhibited two sustained upward regime shifts previously (recorded in carry-over insights): mean ~47 \u2192 ~79 \u2192 ~133 across the timeline, so recent demand is much higher than early samples. Given confirmed same-period lead time and many demand samples across regimes, I choose default lead time so the OR engine uses the promised lead time (0). I also select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples respectively, letting the engine combine long-run data and its internal cap logic. This balances service (we want to meet high recent demand) and holding cost (profit and holding cost equal, so median-based safety stock). No visible overdue shipments or lost orders to adjust L upward.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 decision. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=0). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must cover immediate demand. Demand regime shift at Period 25 produced a sustained higher-demand regime: Periods 25-31 demands = [115,160,141,100,147,137,155], mean \u2248136.43, population std \u224820.07. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 (the length of the current high-demand regime, Periods 25-31) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over those recent samples. This focuses the forecast on the sustained higher-demand regime, increasing target inventory to reduce lost sales risk now that demand is consistently higher. Given Profit = Holding, the backend will target the mean (z*\u22480) so raising mu_hat to the recent regime mean increases service level while sigma_hat based on the same window captures current volatility and keeps safety stock calibrated.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 decision. Recent demand has been at the higher regime (Periods 25-32: mostly 100\u2013155) and historical carry-over already recorded two regime shifts (Period 11 and Period 25). On-hand = 7, in-transit = 0 so we currently have little cover for this period's demand. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 historically (arrivals matched orders same period). Given the confirmed 0 lead time and the game's OR backend formula, I choose default settings so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples (which incorporates the full history including the higher-demand regime). This keeps parameters consistent with observed same-period arrivals and lets the OR engine compute the base-stock level that balances service level vs holding cost (profit = holding cost -> critical fractile = 0.5, which naturally drives z\u22480 and centers orders on the estimated demand). Using defaults avoids overfitting to very recent noise while still reflecting the sustained demand increases already captured in history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34 decision. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period_25 (carry-over insight recorded previously): Periods 25-33 show consistently elevated demand (examples: demands in P25-P33 = 115,160,141,100,147,137,155,130,134; mean ~135 over P25-33). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so there are no arrivals scheduled or overdue shipments to reconcile. Promised lead time is 0 and historically actual lead time has been confirmed as 0, so I use the promised/default lead-time treatment. To ensure the OR backend orders enough to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon while reflecting the recent, sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent regime (Periods 25-33). Regime length = 9, so N=9 (within the allowed 3-20 range). This captures the recent elevated mean and volatility and prevents under-ordering given current zero on-hand/pipeline. Because profit and holding cost are equal, the OR backend will target median service level; using recent demand statistics helps avoid stockouts during this sustained higher-demand period while not grossly overstating variance. No new sustained changepoint detected in the last 3+ periods, so no new carry-over insight is recorded.

Daily Profit: $108.00, Daily Holding Cost: $28.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. On-hand = 28, in-transit = 0. Promised lead time = 0 and historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in history and carry-over). Demand has clearly shifted up in past regimes (carry-over notes shifts at Period 11 and Period 25). Recent demand regime from Period 25\u201334 appears to be the current normal (higher mean and volatility). To avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost (profit = holding cost, so service level tradeoff matters), I use a recent-regime forecast: set L to the promised default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; set mu_hat using the last N=10 periods (Periods 25\u201334) to capture the current elevated mean over the review+lead period; set sigma_hat using the last N=10 periods to capture recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while keeping holding exposure constrained to the current short lead time. The OR backend will convert (1+L)\xd7mean_recent and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_recent into base-stock and cap values balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Recent history shows confirmed zero promised/actual lead time and a sustained higher-demand regime that began at Period 25 (periods 25\u201335 mean demand \u2248136.6). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must order to cover immediate demand this period. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=11) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 25\u201335) rather than diluting it with older, lower-demand data; mu_hat therefore targets (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 11 samples (\u2248136.6 units). sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=11) to reflect the volatility observed in the current regime. Using recent-regime estimates keeps the OR backend\u2019s base_stock aligned with the new normal, improving service (reduce lost sales) while avoiding excessive holding from older, lower-demand periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime that began at Period 25 (carry-over insight). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must instruct the OR engine to plan using the higher recent demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so we use the promised/default lead time. For demand (mu_hat) I use a recent_N approach over the current high-demand regime to capture the new mean without dilution from earlier low-demand periods; I set N=12 (Periods 25\u201336) because that is the detected regime length and satisfies the N selection rule. For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N with N=12 to reflect recent variability. These choices tell the OR backend to compute base_stock and the cap using the recent high-demand mean and std, balancing service level (avoid stockouts in the new regime) against holding cost. No new sustained lead-time or seasonal changes beyond previously recorded insights.

Daily Reward (R_t): $136.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. Recent demand has been at a higher regime since Period 25 (sustained higher weekly demand ~100-170 units). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 (no pending arrivals), so we must cover immediate demand risk. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use default promised lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 25\u201337) to capture the post-Period-25 regime; N computed as regime_length=13, N = max(min(13,20),3)=13. Using recent data reduces bias from earlier, lower-demand periods and produces a base_stock aligned to current demand. For volatility I also use recent_N N=13 to reflect current variability. These choices increase service level to avoid lost sales in the high-demand regime while not inflating safety stock with older low-demand data, balancing profit ($1) vs holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $139.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 decision. Recent demand has settled at a higher regime since the shift around Period 25: last 9 demands (Periods 30-38) = [137,155,130,134,108,143,162,171,161], mean = 144.6, sample std \u2248 19.7. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed early in history and repeatedly thereafter), and current on-hand + in-transit = 0 so we are fully depleted going into this decision. I choose L=default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0 periods and there is no evidence of lost shipments. To reflect the new, sustained high-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, with N=9 (regime length = 9 periods since Period 30). This makes the backend compute demand across the review+lead period using the most recent, relevant samples ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 9 = ~144.6 units). Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=9) ensures safety-stock reflects current volatility (~19.7). These choices balance service (higher target stock to avoid lost sales in the new high-demand regime) against holding cost by using only the recent regime data rather than older, lower-demand samples.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. All historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly since Period 1\u201339), so use promised lead time (default L=0). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0; there are no overdue shipments to reconcile. Recent demand is clearly elevated relative to early periods (regime shifts recorded previously); the most relevant data for next-period demand is the most recent history (Periods 31\u201339: demands = 155,130,134,108,143,162,171,161,200). To keep the base-stock forecast responsive to the high-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand observations, I select recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 concluded demand samples (N=9). This will produce (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the recent high-demand regime, increasing target inventory to preserve service in this sustained higher-demand environment. With Profit = Holding = $1, the OR backend will set service quantile q=0.5; using recent demand stats balances lost-sales risk against holding cost given current zero inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41 context: On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Profit=$1/unit and holding=$1/unit mean critical service-level tradeoff (q=0.5 => z*=0). Historical concluded lead times consistently show 0 periods (multiple concluded messages P1..P40), so I keep L as the promised/default (0). Demand has a clear sustained higher regime starting at Period 25 (carry-over insight already recorded): demands from Periods 25\u201340 are materially higher than earlier periods. To focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime I use a recent_N approach for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, taking N equal to the regime length from the last changepoint (Periods 25\u201340 => 16 periods). This targets (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std estimates to the most relevant recent data and avoids dilution by the pre-25 low regime. With L=0 and recent_N based mu_hat/sigma_hat the OR backend will compute a base-stock appropriate for the elevated demand while the capped order cap limits extreme ordering. Keeping L=default (promised) reflects strong concluded evidence of zero lead time and avoids unnecessary order smoothing that would increase holding costs. The chosen recent_N=16 balances responsiveness to the new regime and sample stability.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over: Period 3). Recent demand (Periods 1-41) shows elevated levels relative to very early data but no new sustained changepoint (need \u22653 periods of consistent evidence beyond already recorded shifts). Given no new confirmed lead-time or regime shifts and promised lead time = 0, I select default methods so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance and the promised lead time. This keeps the base-stock tied to observed long-run demand and leverages the backend cap. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so target service quantile is moderate; using default mu/sigma avoids overreacting to short-term noise when there are no clear new signals. Also, with zero on-hand and in-transit, default parameters will prompt the OR engine to replenish toward the long-run base stock.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 25 (carry-over: regime shift at P25). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we have no cover for today or future periods without ordering. No concluded arrivals are overdue and lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 0 in history, so use the promised/default lead time. For demand forecast I anchor to the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 25\u201342) rather than the full history to reflect the sustained step-up in demand. Regime length = 18 periods (P25\u2013P42) so I use recent_N with N=18 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current mean and volatility over that regime. This balances service (avoid frequent stockouts against high demand) while letting the OR backend compute safety stock given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 0 (concluded arrivals every period). Demand has undergone earlier sustained upward regime shifts (Periods 11 and 25) captured in carry-over insights; recent demands (Periods 25-43) remain elevated versus initial periods. On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we need the OR backend to target cover for the review+lead period (L+1 periods). Given strong evidence that lead time is 0 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=0) and no new sustained changepoint in demand beyond those already recorded, I select: L = default so backend uses the promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively \u2014 this lets the OR engine incorporate the full historical demand (including the elevated recent regime) and compute the base-stock and cap per its formula. This balances service level (by reflecting higher recent mean in the full-sample mean) against holding cost, and avoids overreacting to short-term noise since regime shifts were already consolidated into history.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 decision. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (multiple concluded arrivals same period as order). Demand has undergone two sustained upward regime shifts (Period 11 and Period 25) and demand since Period 25 remains elevated. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must order to cover immediate demand. I set L to default to use the promised lead time (0), consistent with the many conclude messages showing same-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (the most recent 20 periods beginning at the last confirmed regime change in Period 25) to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility. Using recent_N allows the OR engine to size base stock for the elevated mean and variability while keeping holding risk in check; choosing N=20 uses the full available post-changepoint window (capped at 20) to produce stable estimates for (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std that reflect current demand patterns. No overdue shipments or lost orders detected.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 context: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders placed each period arrived same period), so promised lead time = 0 is confirmed. Demand has been in the higher regime for many periods (Periods 25-45 average demand ~114 units/period), with no new sustained changepoint in the last few periods. Given confirmed lead time=0 and stable high-demand regime, I use default calculations so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean demand and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full history. This keeps the policy responsive to the established higher mean while letting the backend set the service-level safety stock using the profit/holding cost tradeoff. Using defaults also avoids overreacting to short-term noise; with zero lead time, orders arrive same period, so small corrective orders can be placed next period if demand shifts again. (Note: full-history mean \u2248114.38 units/period used by backend when L=0.)

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 in concluded history (multiple periods showing arrived in same period), so I use the default promised lead time. Demand has moved into a higher regime since Period 25 and the most recent 10 concluded demands (Periods 37-46: 171,161,200,145,150,223,177,179,166,172) average ~174.4 \u2014 I therefore set mu_hat using a recent_N mean with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime and avoid diluting with older lower-demand periods. Volatility also appears elevated in these recent periods; I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 so the OR backend measures current demand variability and sets safety stock accordingly. These choices keep the base-stock targeted to recent realized demand (improving service) while the matching recent sigma limits excessive extra safety stock that would raise holding costs given profit=holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201347) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period they were ordered). Demand has stepped up historically (noted regime shifts at Period 11 and Period 25). Recent demand (Periods 28\u201347, especially 40\u201347) is substantially higher than early-period levels and shows continued volatility with several very large demands (e.g., 223 at P42, 222 at P47). I choose to (1) set L using observed lead times (calculate) to confirm the persistent 0-period lead time signal; (2) set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to anchor the base-stock calculation to the most recent 20 demand observations so the OR backend targets the current high-demand regime while capturing recent volatility. Using recent_N for both mean and std reduces risk of understocking from older low-demand periods and balances service level vs holding cost by reflecting current demand scale and variability.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 context: on-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical data shows sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 25 (carry-over insight): recent demand levels are much higher than early periods. Promised lead time is 0 and earlier concluded history (Periods 1-48) consistently confirms actual lead time = 0, so I use the default promised lead time to keep ordering aligned with supplier promise. On demand forecasting I focus on the most recent sustained regime (Periods 25+) because that regime (+68% jump) is still in effect and best predicts near-term demand. I select recent_N for mu_hat with N=20 (the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 20 demand samples) to capture the current high-demand mean while smoothing short-term noise. I also select recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 so variability reflects the same recent window. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to avoid lost sales given very low on-hand and zero in-transit, while using recent data limits over-reaction to older low-demand periods. No evidence of missing or delayed shipments (arrivals always concluded with lead_time=0), so no lead-time explicit adjustment is needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $152.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 decision. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since the carry-over insights (notably Periods 25+). Current on-hand=5, in-transit=0 \u2014 effectively no cover for upcoming demand this period. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (multiple confirmations), so I use the default promised lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime and current elevated demand levels, I set mu_hat using a recent_N forecast over the most recent 9 demand observations (Periods 41-49) which average ~178 units; this gives the OR engine a base-stock aligned with current demand. Because demand volatility has also increased, I set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=9 so the backend computes variability from the same recent window. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts) while the OR backend will cap orders; using recent data avoids dilution from much lower early-period demand and aligns safety stock with recent volatility. No explicit numeric values are provided here because the backend will compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the specified recent_N windows.
