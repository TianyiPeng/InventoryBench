Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical samples for chips(Regular) show recent demand: [30,49,48,65,56] with mean 49.6 units/period and noticeable variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals exist yet (no evidence of lead-time shifts or lost shipments). Promised lead time is 0; with no concluded data to contradict it, use default lead time. Use default demand and volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set, which captures the observed mean (~49.6) and variability while letting the backend apply the profit/holding tradeoff and caps. This conservative choice avoids overfitting to very short samples and preserves responsiveness in future periods when concluded arrivals or regime changes appear.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period: Period_2. Recent concluded history shows Period_1 order (71) arrived in same period (arrived=71, lead_time=0). On-hand = 21, in-transit = 0. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [30,49,48,65,56] (mean = 49.6). Promised lead time = 0 and the single concluded observation confirms a 0-period arrival for the most recent order, so I use the default promised lead time. With L = 0, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples (this yields mu \u2248 49.6 forecast for the review+lead period). This keeps decisions tied to the full-sample demand estimate and leverages the backend's analytic service-level calculation (profit-to-cost tradeoff) while avoiding overreacting to a single-period signal. On-hand (21) vs expected period demand (~49.6) implies we will likely order to replenish to the computed base stock; using defaults avoids bias from small-sample recent noise while the system gathers more concluded lead-time evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $831.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 both arrived in the same period (arrived in P1 and P2 respectively), so evidence supports actual lead time = 0 so far. Current on-hand = 24, in-transit = 0; upcoming demand for the decision horizon should be forecast from the provided historical demand samples (30,49,48,65,56) which have mean = 49.6. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals match that for two periods, so I use the calculated lead-time estimator to let the backend confirm (average of observed lead times = 0). For demand I choose the default method so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 1*49.6, which balances recent sample mean with the OR engine's stock formula. For sigma_hat I also use the default so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) (population std \u2248 11.54) to reflect observed variability. These choices keep target base-stock centered on the historical mean demand while using observed zero lead time to avoid extra pipeline safety stock and thus limit holding costs given high per-unit profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1273.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (provided) across five periods have mean \u224849.6 units and std \u224812.7; observed concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-3 arrived same period (lead_time=0). Profit $19 vs holding $1 yields q=19/20=0.95, implying a high service-level target (z large). Given clear, sustained evidence of zero lead time in concluded history and no signs of missing shipments, I use the default (promised) lead time to let the OR engine use the known promised L=0. For demand forecast and volatility I also select default methods so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances high service level (to avoid lost sales given high profit) against holding cost by relying on the OR engine's z* calculation and its capped ordering policy. I note current on-hand + pipeline = 0, so the backend will likely order toward the high service-level base stock to cover expected demand this period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3).

Daily Profit: $855.00, Daily Holding Cost: $36.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $819.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. Context: on-hand=36, in-transit=0, recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P4 arrived same period). Demand history (all samples) average = 49.6 units/period; variance moderate. Profit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), so the OR backend should bias toward higher service level. I therefore use the default lead time (promised = 0, supported by concluded arrivals) and default demand estimates so the backend computes base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 with q = profit/(profit+holding) and its capped order cap. Using defaults keeps the forecast anchored to all available samples (stable recent pattern) and leverages the backend formula to trade off stock vs. holding costs. No overdue shipments observed (in-transit=0), so no explicit adjustments for lost/delayed orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1061.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision. Recent realized demand (Periods 1\u20135) = [50,45,86,45,57], mean \u2248 56.6 units, sample std \u2248 17.2. On-hand = 22, in-transit = 0. Promised lead time = 0 and past concluded arrivals show lead time=0 consistently (confirmed earlier). No sustained demand regime change: the high value in Period 3 (86) is a one-period spike, not a multi-period shift (no 3+ period trend). With lead time = 0 the OR model needs to cover current period demand (L+1 =1). I therefore use the defaults so the backend computes base_stock from the full-sample mean/variance, giving mu_hat \u2248 (1+0)*56.6 \u2248 56.6 and sigma_hat \u2248 sqrt(1+0)*17.2 \u2248 17.2. This balances service level (using full-sample estimates to capture typical demand) against holding cost given relatively low holding cost ($1 vs. $19 profit). Note on inventory posture: on-hand 22 and no in-transit means we are under the estimated 1-period demand (\u224856.6) and the OR engine will place an order to refill toward the computed base-stock. If future periods show a sustained change (\u22653 periods) I will switch to recent_N or EWMA methods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $922.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 decision. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-6) shows on-hand=28, in-transit=0 and every order in history arrived same period (lead_time observed = 0 consistently). Demand observed in concluded periods: P1=50, P2=45, P3=86, P4=45, P5=57, P6=50 \u2014 no sustained, multi-period regime shift (one high spike at P3 only). Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes confirm same-period arrivals, so I use the default promised lead time to keep the OR backend assumptions aligned. With L = default, I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level against holding cost using the full-sample statistics rather than overreacting to the single high demand spike at P3. On-hand (28) plus zero pipeline is visible; no overdue shipments. Using default statistics keeps orders sized to cover expected demand for the review+lead period without excessive inventory buildup given low holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $924.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start. Recent observed demands (Periods 3-7) = [86, 45, 57, 50, 50]; on-hand=26, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and prior concluded messages (Periods 1\u20137) consistently show arrivals same-period \u2192 actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand shows one large spike (P3=86) but subsequent periods (P4\u2013P7) returned to the mid-40s/50s range; no sustained upward regime. To balance service level vs holding cost I use L=default to keep the backend's view aligned with promised lead time. For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach (N=5) to capture the most recent regime including the spike but weighted equally to avoid overreacting; this sets mu_hat to (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands (reflecting current demand level ~57.6). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent variability including the spike. These choices ensure the OR engine orders to cover the immediate-period demand (L+1 periods) with safety driven by recent volatility while avoiding excessive inventory from older samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1195.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 start. On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u20138) consistently show same-period arrivals; previous carry-over insight confirmed lead time = 0. Recent demand over the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 4\u20138: 45,57,50,50,64) averages higher than the older 5-sample prior; I treat this as the current demand regime for the review+lead window. Therefore: set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 and there are no missed shipments. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures the modest uptick to ~53 units). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility rather than the older sample set. This combination keeps the OR backend's base-stock tuned to current demand while avoiding overreaction to single spikes, and balances service level (profit high relative to holding cost) against inventory carry given on-hand=21 and no pipeline arrivals expected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $554.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 context: confirmed history shows arrivals each period with lead time 0 (Periods 1-9 concluded arrivals same period). On-hand = 35, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand (Periods 5-9) = [57,50,50,64,31], recent mean = 50.4, overall mean (Periods 1-9) \u2248 53.1. Profit per unit ($19) >> holding cost ($1) => very high critical ratio (q\u22480.95) so the OR backend will target a high service level; to avoid excessive inventory from using the full 9-period mean (which includes an isolated large spike at Period 3 = 86), I use a recent-window forecast to reflect the more typical recent demand regime. Lead time remains the promised 0 and is confirmed by concluded history, so I leave L as default. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime (Periods 5-9) and reduce sensitivity to the isolated Period 3 spike. This keeps base-stock responsive while the high profit justifies higher z*. Given on-hand=35 and no pipeline, the backend will compute orders to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the base stock derived from these parameters, balancing service level (to capture high profit sales) against carrying cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $489.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 start. Recent demand history (P1\u2013P10): [50,45,86,45,57,50,50,64,31,28], mean=50.6 units/period, demand volatility moderate with occasional spike (P3=86). On-hand=43, in-transit=0 \u2192 current visible stock is slightly below the recent mean demand so without ordering we'll likely stockout this period. Historical concluded arrivals (P1\u2013P10) consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed in carry-over); no evidence of lost shipments. I therefore use L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand forecasting I use the default methods so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures all available history and the P3 spike) and default volatility so the engine computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. These choices balance service level (mean demand ~50.6 suggests we should replenish toward that level) against holding cost: using full-sample mean and std gives a stable base-stock target while keeping z* driven by profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3, P4 arrived P4, P5 arrived P5, P6 arrived P6, P7 arrived P7, P8 arrived P8, P9 arrived P9, P10 arrived P10).

=== Period 11 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1205.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 context: lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 periods (concludes through Period 11). Recent demand history (Periods 1\u201311) shows no sustained regime shift: demands = [50,45,86,45,57,50,50,64,31,28,64], mean \u2248 51.82 units/period, moderate variability but no 3+ period sustained change. Current inventory: on-hand=11, in-transit=0, so available supply covers only ~0.21 of a typical period; with promised/confirmed L=0 we must replenish to meet same-period demand. Economics: profit = $19/unit, holding = $1/unit/period \u21d2 high critical ratio (q \u2248 19/(19+1)=0.95) so we favor service level over modest holding cost. Given confirmed lead time = 0 and no significant recent changepoint, I use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean demand + safety stock per its formula and applies the capped policy. This leverages the full historical sample for stable estimates while letting the OR engine incorporate the profit/holding tradeoff into z* and the cap. This setting also avoids overreacting to the single high demand spike (86 at Period 3) and to noise in low-demand periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 start. Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed repeatedly through Period 12). Current on-hand = 13, in-transit = 0, no overdue shipments. Demand history through Period 12 shows moderate variability but no sustained regime shift (last 12 periods demand fluctuates between ~28 and 86 with no >30% persistent jump). Given confirmed prompt deliveries and no strong recent demand changepoint, use the backend defaults so the OR engine uses the full historical mean/variance over (1+L) review+lead window. This keeps the base-stock calibrated to long-run average demand while the supply reliability (L=0) allows lower pipeline targets and prevents excess holding costs. Defaults let the OR engine compute safety stock from profit/holding tradeoff and observed variability.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals through Period 13 consistently show lead_time=0 (every order from P1\u2013P13 arrived same period). Demand history (P1\u2013P13) = [50,45,86,45,57,50,50,64,31,28,64,63,103], mean \u2248 56.6 units, sample std \u2248 20.5. With confirmed same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost shipments, use the promised/default lead time (L=0). I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages the full observed demand history (mean \u224856.6, std \u224820.5) to set base-stock and the capped order cap. Using defaults balances service level (capture spikes such as the recent 103 demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio; it avoids overreacting to a single high demand by relying on the overall sample statistics. Because on-hand + in-transit = 0, the backend will compare the computed base_stock to pipeline and place orders accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1614.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 context: on-hand=1, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals visible for recent orders. Historical concluded lead-time evidence (Periods 1\u201314) consistently shows arrivals in the same period they were ordered, so actual lead time = 0 is confirmed. Recent demand (Periods 12\u201314 = 63, 103, 85) shows a sustained higher regime for 3 periods versus the earlier periods (Periods 1\u201311 average demand \u2248 51.82). To protect service while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set L to the promised/default (0) and use a recent_N demand estimate with N=3 so the OR engine targets the (L+1)-period demand reflective of the new higher regime (mean \u2248 83.7). I also use recent_N N=3 for sigma to capture the elevated short-term volatility. This increases target base_stock to reduce stockouts given the sustained uplift while keeping holding cost pressure visible to the optimizer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 12: avg demand P12\u2013P14 = 83.67 vs prior P1\u2013P11 avg = 51.82 (+61.6%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 decision. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 in prior periods (consistent with carry-over). Recent demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 12: Periods 12\u201315 demands = [63,103,85,85], average \u224884, higher than earlier periods. On-hand = 32, in-transit = 0. With confirmed L=0, current period demand must be covered immediately; using a recent regime window captures the higher post-change mean and recent volatility. Choices: L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. mu_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to target the new regime mean (Periods 12\u201315), so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 4 samples \u224884 units, matching the elevated demand. sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to reflect the recent regime's volatility (captures variation due to the large 103 spike). These parameters bias orders toward higher service (protecting against stockouts in the new higher-demand regime) while holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so prioritizing service level is appropriate.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Recent demand has shifted up starting Period 12: Periods 12\u201316 demands = [63,103,85,85,79], avg \u224883.0 (vs prior long-run \u224852). On-hand = 32, in-transit = 0, so no arrivals pending. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime (5 periods since changepoint) I set L to the promised/default (0) and asked the OR engine to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 periods so the base-stock target and cap reflect the higher mean and recent volatility. This raises the forecasted (1+L)\xd7mean and the safety stock to improve service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19) keeps z* high and justifies carrying more inventory to avoid stockouts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1973.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 decision. History shows actual lead time confirmed as 0 in many concluded periods; promised lead time = 0 remains valid. Current inventory: on-hand=3, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted higher starting Period 12 (Period12\u201317 demands = [63,103,85,85,79,104], recent avg \u2248 86.5) versus earlier average \u2248 51.8 \u2014 a sustained regime. To capture the new higher-demand regime and keep stock available given same-day arrivals, I set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=6 (the length of the confirmed higher-demand regime, Period12\u201317) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 6 samples) which biases orders toward the higher recent mean and helps avoid stockouts. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect the realized volatility in the new regime (captures the larger spread caused by two ~100 demands). This balances profit (high per-unit profit $19) against holding cost ($1) by raising the base stock to service the higher recent demand while using only 6-sample recent stats to avoid overreacting to older low-demand data. No evidence of lost shipments; same-period arrivals have been reliable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1808.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 context: recent periods (P12\u2013P18) show a sustained higher-demand regime versus P1\u2013P11 (P12\u2013P14 noted earlier). Current on-hand = 16, in-transit = 0, so no pipeline cover for upcoming demand. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded messages through Period 18 confirm actual lead time = 0 repeatedly, so no upward lead-time adjustment is needed. I set L to default (use promised 0). For demand I detect a changepoint starting Period 12; I therefore use recent_N (N=7, covering P12\u2013P18) to capture the new higher mean demand (avg \u2248 87.86 units per period). Using recent samples prevents dilution by older low-demand history and ensures the base stock reflects the current regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=7 to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices raise target base stock to improve service (avoid stockouts observed in high-demand periods) while sigma based on recent volatility prevents over-ordering; holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so biasing toward higher service is appropriate. Given on-hand=16 and no pipeline, this will produce an order to cover the elevated (1+L)-period demand and safety stock implied by recent mean and variance.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2128.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. Demand history through Period 19 shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 12 (carry-over insight already recorded). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue arrivals or lost shipments to reconcile. Promised lead time = 0 and multiple concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 0, so use default lead time to keep OR backend aligned with supplier promise. Because demand increased and has been sustained from Period 12 onward, I use a recent_N forecast for both mu_hat and sigma_hat anchored on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 12\u201319, 8 samples) so the base stock reflects the new higher mean and the increased volatility. N=8 is selected per the changepoint rule (regime length = 8; N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) = 8). This raises target inventory to protect service during the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures the larger variability so the backend's cap limits extreme over-ordering given the holding cost ($1/unit). Overall: L=default to reflect confirmed 0 lead time; mu_hat recent_N to increase (1+L)-scaled demand estimate from the new regime; sigma_hat recent_N to reflect observed volatility and temper orders via the OR cap.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent demand has been in the higher regime that began at Period 12 (P12\u2013P20 shows consistently elevated demand versus P1\u2013P11). Current on-hand=2, in-transit=0 and promised lead time is 0; historical conclude messages through Period 20 confirm actual lead time = 0 (many orders arrived same period they were placed). With lead time effectively 0, the OR base-stock should cover (1+L) review+lead demand where L=0. I choose L="default" to rely on the promised lead time (which is supported by repeated concluded arrivals = 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the last 9 periods (Period 12\u201320) because the demand regime shift at Period 12 is sustained (9 periods in the new regime); N=9 follows the guideline N = max(min(regime_length,20),3). Using the recent 9-sample mean captures the higher current mean demand and avoids diluting it with older lower-demand data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=9 to reflect volatility in the current regime. These choices increase the target base-stock to protect service level in the sustained high-demand regime while keeping holding cost in mind; with L=0 we avoid extra pipeline uncertainty and order as needed to restore on-hand coverage.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 decision. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 12 (previously recorded). On-hand = 9, in-transit = 0; no overdue arrivals. Recent demands (P12\u2013P21) have been elevated vs P1\u2013P11, so I want the OR engine to target the higher regime. Promised lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 in concluded history, so use default lead time. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime to reflect the new mean/variance: regime length P12\u2013P21 = 10 periods, so set N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This concentrates replenishment on the higher recent mean (reduces stockouts) while the backend's capped order will limit excessive ordering; using recent data avoids diluting the forecast with earlier, lower-demand periods and helps balance the high service level implied by profit/holding (q\u22480.95) against holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2335.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 context: recent periods (P12\u2013P22) show a sustained higher demand regime after Period 12. Current on-hand = 2, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is far below recent per-period demand (recent mean >> 2). Historic concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (many confirmed same-period arrivals), so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. I set L to default to keep lead-time assumption at the promised 0 periods (supported by repeated concluded evidence). For demand sizing I use recent_N on the most recent regime (Period 12\u201322) to capture the elevated mean demand and avoid under-ordering: N=11 (regime length = 11). Using recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N captures the current volatility rather than diluting with older low-demand periods. These choices push the OR backend to a higher base stock (covering the elevated mean and current variability) which balances high profit ($19/unit) against modest holding cost ($1/unit) to avoid costly stockouts in the high-demand regime. Because on-hand+pipeline is essentially zero relative to recent demand, this will result in meaningful replenishment recommendations from the OR engine.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 12 sustained through Period 22: avg demand P12\u2013P22 = 98.36 vs prior P1\u2013P11 avg = 51.82 (+89.6%)

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 start. History shows stable, same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed repeatedly through Period 23) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 12: recent periods (P12\u2013P23) have much higher demand (~98 avg) vs earlier (~52). Current on-hand = 12, in-transit = 0 so we are effectively exposed to same high-demand regime with little buffer. Therefore: keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time; use recent_N for demand parameters to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (N = 12 covers Period 12\u201323). This increases the base-stock estimate to meet the new higher demand while keeping volatility based on the same recent window. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher ordering to avoid lost sales in the sustained high-demand regime, while cap constraints will limit extreme orders and holding cost ($1/unit) is low relative to profit ($19/unit), so prioritizing service is appropriate.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Historical demand shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 12 (Periods 12\u201324 average demand \u2248 105.6 units vs prior P1\u2013P11 avg 51.82; sustained for 13 periods). All concluded arrivals in history indicate actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). With zero inventory and no pipeline, we must cover the immediate (L+1) period demand; given confirmed regime shift to higher demand, we should base demand forecast on the post-changepoint samples. Choices: L set by calculating observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 0); mu_hat set using recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (N=13, Periods 12\u201324) so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of recent regime \u2248 105.6; sigma_hat set using recent_N over the same N=13 to capture the volatility of the new regime (sample std \u2248 27.1, scaled by sqrt(1+L) in backend). This keeps service high under the sustained higher-demand regime while avoiding overstating uncertainty beyond the recent regime. Because arrivals have consistently had 0 lead time, we do not extend lead time despite tight inventory\u2014instead we rely on the backend's base-stock calculation using the recent higher mean and its volatility.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26 decision. Context: multiple concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals through Period_25). Recent demand has clearly been elevated since Period_12 (previous carry-over). More recently, demand in Periods 23\u201325 = [117, 174, 115] shows a further upward shift vs the earlier elevated regime (P12\u2013P22 avg \u224898). On-hand = 36, in-transit = 0; with lead time 0, any order placed will arrive within the same demand cycle (and will be observed in the conclude message). To capture the latest regime while keeping the OR backend\u2019s base-stock calculation responsive, I choose: L = default (use promised lead time 0), mu_hat = recent_N using the newest detected regime (Periods 23\u201325) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean of the most recent 3 samples, and sigma_hat = recent_N with N=3 to reflect volatility in the same short recent window. This focuses service level on the newest sustained increase (3 periods) while avoiding overreaction to single spikes. These parameters will raise the base stock and the cap appropriately to reduce expected stockouts given the higher recent demand, while sigma_hat based on N=3 ensures safety stock reflects increased variability at the most recent horizon. Also note: no overdue or lost shipments are present (arrivals confirmed each period), so default lead time is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: avg demand P23\u2013P25 = 135.33 vs prior P12\u2013P22 avg = 98.36 (+37.6%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $3009.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 23 (carry-over noted): recent demands P23\u2013P26 = [117, 174, 115, 160], mean = 141.5 units, sample std \u2248 30.0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods through Period 26. Current inventory: on-hand=31, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals historically confirm that, so use the default promised lead time. Because demand clearly shifted up starting Period 23 and that regime persists through Period 26, I base demand forecasts on the most recent regime (last 4 periods) to capture the higher mean and realized volatility. I choose recent_N (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock sized for the new higher-demand regime while reflecting recent variability. This is conservative on service (profit >> holding cost, implied q\u22480.95) to avoid lost sales given high profit per unit; using recent data avoids diluting the forecast with earlier low-demand periods. With no pipeline, the system must order to bring inventory toward the higher base-stock implied by recent demand to cover the immediate (L+1)=1 period of demand after ordering.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 decision. Recent demand has settled into a higher regime since Period 23 (P23\u2013P27 demands = [117,174,115,160,141], avg = 141.4), substantially above the pre-Period-12 baseline. On-hand = 50, in-transit = 0, so no incoming units will cover Period 28 demand \u2014 we must order for current-period demand plus safety stock. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 0, so using the promised/default lead time is appropriate. I choose L = default to keep lead time = 0. For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach (N=5) covering Periods 23\u201327 to capture the current high-demand regime; this yields (1+L)\xd7mean based on the most recent 5 samples. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) so the OR backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of those same 5 samples. Using recent_N increases the base_stock and the cap to protect against stockouts in this sustained high-demand regime, while still allowing the OR engine's q (profit/(profit+holding)) to control the service vs holding tradeoff. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift is present.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. Recent demand remains in the elevated regime established from Period 12 onward; last five demands (P24\u2013P28) = [174,115,160,141,100], mean=138.0, showing sustained high demand versus pre-Period12. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (every prior order arrived same period), so promised lead time is reliable. Current inventory: on-hand=85, in-transit=0, so we have some buffer but no pipeline replenishment. To balance service level (high profit $19) against low holding cost ($1), I keep L as default (promised 0) and use a recent_N forecast to capture the elevated recent mean and volatility. Using N=5 focuses the forecast on the most recent demand regime (captures the P24\u2013P28 spike and variability) so the OR backend will size base stock to meet current elevated demand while capping order size to limit excess holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2751.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Recent demand has been well above the early-period baseline (sustained regime shifts recorded in carry-over). On-hand=42, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0, so use promised/default lead time. Demand over the most recent 5 concluded periods (Periods 25\u201329: 115, 151, 155, 135, 104? \u2014 but focusing on the most recent clear elevated regime, I use the last 5 demand samples P25\u2013P29 = 115, 160, 141, 100, 147) yields a recent mean \u2248 132.6 units \u2014 substantially higher than the long-run mean and consistent with the documented regime shifts. To keep the OR backend responsive to the sustained higher demand while limiting holding cost exposure, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the base-stock and cap reflect the recent elevated mean and realized volatility (~22). L is left at default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals across many periods confirm 0 lead time. This configuration increases target inventory to meet higher demand without over-committing to long-term averages.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 decision. Recent history shows consistently zero actual lead time (confirmed repeatedly in concluded periods) and a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning Period 12 with a further step-up around Period 23. Current inventory: on-hand=36, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand (Periods 23\u201330) = [117,174,115,160,141,100,147,137], mean = 136.375 over last 8 periods. With promised lead time = 0 and observed arrivals historically matching that, I use the default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with supplier promise. However demand is clearly in a higher regime (Period 23+), so I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent regime (last 8 periods, P23\u2013P30) to capture the current elevated mean and variability. This recent_N choice (N=8) yields an expected (1+L)-period demand around 136.4 units \u2014 much greater than on-hand (36), so ordering to raise the pipeline toward that level reduces near-term stockout risk. Using recent demand and volatility focuses safety stock where it is needed now (higher service level) while the OR engine\u2019s cap will limit excessively large orders to control holding cost. The parameters: L default (promised lead time 0); mu_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect elevated current mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 decision. On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods (many period concludes confirm same-period arrivals). Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 12 with further increases around Period 23\u201326 (recorded in carry-over). Given the long history of concluded zero lead time, I select L=default to keep promised lead time=0. To let the OR engine use the full observed demand history (which already embeds the sustained higher-demand regime), I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the base-stock anchored to the empirical overall mean/volatility while the capped ordering constraint will limit order size per period; with Profit >> Holding cost (q high) this yields a relatively high service-level target appropriate for the sustained higher demand. Current low on-hand (22) and zero in-transit mean the backend will likely order up toward the computed base stock to avoid stockouts immediately.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: recent history shows sustained high-demand regime since Period 23 (carry-over notes). On-hand=24, in-transit=0, so current visible supply is far below recent demand levels (recent 10-period avg \u2248137.6). Promised lead time has repeatedly been confirmed as 0 in concluded periods; I'll use the default lead time (promised=0). To capture the current elevated demand regime and its most relevant volatility, I use recent_N over the last 10 periods (Periods 23\u201332) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10 is the regime length and meets the recent_N rule). This biases the OR backend toward a substantially larger base-stock to avoid stockouts during this sustained high-demand phase while sigma_hat from recent variability calibrates safety stock. Given profit=$19 and holding=$1, the backend will set service-level q and compute z*; my choices ensure the backend's base_stock reflects the new higher demand rather than long-run lower history, while keeping lead time at the historically confirmed 0 so arrivals are same-period.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26: recent demands (P26\u2013P33) avg \u2248 138 units/period. On-hand = 41, in-transit = 0, promised lead time = 0 and past concluded messages consistently confirm 0 lead time. With current on-hand (41) and expected single-period demand \u2248138, we must target the recent regime mean rather than long-run average. Therefore: L set to default (promised 0). mu_hat set using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=8, P26\u2013P33) so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u2248138, aligning base-stock to current elevated demand. sigma_hat set using recent_N N=8 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service (reduce lost sales given much higher recent demand) while the relatively low holding cost ($1) vs. profit ($19) favors stocking to meet demand. The OR backend will apply its z* and cap constraints; using recent_N for mean and volatility gives it up-to-date inputs for the elevated regime.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Current on-hand = 61, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (many periods with orders arriving same period), and carry-over insights confirm sustained lead-time=0 and multiple upward demand regime shifts (notably starting Period 12 and again around Period 23). Recent demand (Periods 26\u201334) remains elevated with mean \u2248 134.7 units, so I treat the most recent regime as the best predictor for the next review+lead period. Given lead time appears reliably 0, I choose L = default to use the promised lead time (0). For mu_hat I select recent_N using the last 9 demand samples (Periods 26\u201334) to capture the current higher-demand regime; this focuses the base-stock on the elevated demand rather than diluting it with older, lower-demand data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N = 9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase the target base stock to improve service under the sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind by limiting the lookback to the most relevant regime instead of the full historical series.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Recent history shows consistent, same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed across many concluded periods) and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 23 (P23\u2013P35 high demand). Current on-hand = 25, in-transit = 0 so no incoming units are scheduled to arrive this period. I choose L="default" to trust the promised lead time of 0 (supported by many concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (covering Periods 23\u201335, the current high-demand regime length = 13) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 13 samples; this focuses the forecast on the sustained higher-demand regime and avoids diluting with older low-demand data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=13 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices raise the backend base-stock to meet the elevated demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock; using recent data prevents stockouts under the new regime while limiting excess holding by not over-weighting distant historical lows.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders from P1..P36 all arrived same period). Demand has been in a higher regime since P12 with further uplift around P26; recent demand remains elevated. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0 periods. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=11 (covering Period 26\u201336 regime length \u224811), so mu_hat and sigma_hat are based on the last 11 demand samples \u2014 this biases the base stock upward to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from the same window quantifies volatility for safety stock. With profit $19 and holding $1, the backend will target a high service quantile (q\u22480.95); using recent regime statistics reduces stockouts from under-forecasting while keeping holding cost awareness via sigma_hat and the engine cap. No in-transit arrivals are overdue and no lost shipments detected.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (multiple confirmations across periods), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has shifted upward in past regimes (sustained increases starting Period 12 and again around Period 23/26) but those regime shifts are already recorded in carry-over insights; given abundant historical samples and confirmed lead time=0, I choose default aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps parameters stable and lets the OR engine apply its profit/holding tradeoff (high profit relative to holding cost will yield a higher z service level). Using default L ensures orders arrive same period as placed (matches observed behavior) and avoids over-complicating estimates given no new sustained pattern since last insights. Finally, with on-hand and in-transit both zero, this parameterization will prompt the OR engine to replenish toward the backend's computed base stock to restore service while respecting its cap.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39 context: on-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (many confirms), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has clearly shifted up and stabilized since Period_23; mean demand P23\u2013P38 = 140.94 units/period (16 samples). With profit $19 and holding $1, critical fractile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 \u2014 we should target a high service level. Given the sustained higher-demand regime from P23 onward (16 periods), I set demand forecast using the recent regime (recent_N) to capture current elevated mean and volatility rather than diluting with older low-demand periods. This helps the OR backend compute base_stock = mu_hat + z*\xb7sigma_hat with a high z*, reducing stockouts while holding cost is low relative to profit. Reconciling inventory: with only 5 on-hand and no in-transit, ordering to cover (1+L) periods at the recent mean is warranted to avoid lost sales under the new high-demand regime. Methods chosen: L=default to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=16 (Period_23\u2013Period_38) to reflect the sustained high-demand regime.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and past concluded history consistently confirms actual lead time = 0 across many periods (multiple concluded periods showing same-period arrivals), so I will use the default (promised) lead time. Demand has experienced sustained upward regime shifts noted in carry-over history; recent demand since Period 23 is materially higher than early periods (carry-over: elevated regimes starting P12, P23, and P26). To capture the current high-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast for mean and volatility using the most recent regime (Periods 23\u201339 inclusive = 17 periods) so the OR engine orders to cover current demand level. I choose N=17 (regime length 17, capped by available samples rule). This raises mu_hat (=(1+L)*mean of last 17 samples) and sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)*std of last 17 samples) so the backend's base-stock and cap reflect the elevated mean and variability, balancing higher service level (avoid stockouts during strong demand) against holding cost (holding cost is low relative to profit). Using default lead time (0) keeps pipeline short since arrivals have been same-period historically.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 0 in many concluded periods (P1..P40 all arrived same period). On-hand = 43, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. Demand history shows sustained higher-demand regimes already recorded in carry-over insights (shifts at P12 and P23 and P26). Given stable same-period arrivals and no new aberration in the last several periods, use the promised/default lead time so the OR backend uses current promised L. I choose default forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat default) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available samples \u2014 this leverages the full observed demand history including recent high-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and caps. This balances service (high profit $19 vs holding $1 encourages availability) against holding cost: by relying on full-sample statistics and confirmed L=0, the backend will size orders to cover one period of demand with safety stock implicitly set by the q ratio. No explicit over-ordering is needed because on-hand (43) plus the OR order will cover expected demand; we avoid explicit inflation of mu_hat which would raise holding costs unnecessarily.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 0 (no delays). Demand has exhibited sustained upward shifts: a jump starting P12, another step up around P23 and again around P26; recent periods (P26\u2013P41) show substantially higher demand (e.g., P36\u2013P41: 162,171,161,200,145,150). To ensure the OR backend targets the current high-demand regime, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, with N=17 to cover the sustained high-demand period beginning around P26 through the most recent data. L is set to default (promised lead time = 0) because conclude history consistently confirms same-period arrivals. Using recent_N captures the elevated mean and higher volatility in the current regime so the base-stock will rise to protect service level; the sigma choice increases safety stock to account for variability while the backend\u2019s cap still limits extreme over-ordering, balancing profit per unit vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been well above early-period levels\u2014sustained high-demand regime from Period 23 onward. I want the OR backend to target the recent high-demand regime so orders cover the review+lead period demand. Therefore: keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime; choose N=20 to cover the sustained regime from Period 23\u201342 (20 periods) so the forecast reflects the most recent stable elevated demand and its volatility. This balances service level (reduce stockouts during elevated demand) against holding cost by using observed recent mean and std rather than the long-run lower mean. The backend will compute base_stock and cap using these inputs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3342.00

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 in many periods (confirmed repeatedly through Period 43), so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Demand has clearly shifted upward in earlier phases (regime change starting Period 12 and further uplift around Period 23 and Period 26). The most recent sustained higher-demand regime runs from Period 23 onward (Periods 23\u201343 available). To keep the backend's forecast sensitive to the elevated recent demand while still using many samples for stable volatility estimates, I select recent_N with N=20 (capped by available recent regime length). This (1+L)\xd7mean over the last 20 demand samples will push base_stock up to cover current high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N=20 captures recent variability. Using L=default (0) keeps orders arriving same period and avoids artificially inflating pipeline coverage. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat tuned to elevated recent demand) while sigma_hat and the backend cap limit prevent extreme over-ordering, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show orders arriving same period (lead_time=0) across many periods (Periods 1\u201344), so promised lead time=0 is reliable. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting around Period 12 and subsequent step-ups (recorded in carry-over insights), but those are already captured and no new sustained changepoint is evident in Periods 42\u201344. Given current on-hand is low and there are no in-transit units, I keep L at the default (promised lead time=0) so arrivals will be treated as same-period by the OR backend. I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses the (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of the full historical samples \u2014 this leverages the long-run demand evidence and the confirmed zero lead time. This balances service level (by reflecting historically higher demand in the full-sample mean) against holding cost; if demand outlier patterns re-emerge, I will switch to recent_N or explicit forecasts. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (multiple confirms through Period 45). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime for many periods (regime shifts recorded through Periods 23\u201345). Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) the OR formula targets a very high service level; to reflect the sustained elevated demand I use a recent-sample forecast rather than the full-history mean. Therefore: L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms lead time=0; mu_hat set with recent_N using the last 20 demand observations (Periods 26\u201345) to capture the current high-demand regime; sigma_hat set with recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned with the elevated demand and the backend's high critical ratio while avoiding excessive overweighting of much older low-demand samples. No overdue shipments detected (in-transit=0), so no explicit lead-time correction needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3238.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0 (many periods confirmed). On-hand = 30, in-transit = 0. Demand has been in a higher regime since ~Period_12 and especially elevated from Period_23 onward; recent periods (P27\u2013P46) show consistently high weekly demand (typically 100\u2013200). To capture the current high-demand regime while keeping the OR engine's base-stock responsive, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0. For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach with N=20 (the most recent 20 demand observations) to reflect the sustained high-demand regime and reduce influence of older low-demand periods. I apply recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N=20 so the backend computes volatility based on the same recent window. These choices bias the base-stock upward to maintain service during this sustained high-demand period while the 0 lead time keeps orders arriving same period they are placed, limiting unnecessary pipeline buildup and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3857.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 decision. Recent history shows many consecutive concluded arrivals with lead_time=0 (orders placed arrive same period), on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 at start of Period 48. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 23 (carry-over notes show sustained increases, with very high recent demands through Period 47). No overdue shipments to reconcile. I therefore keep L as default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (the most recent 20 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat: the carry-over insights identify a sustained regime change starting Period 23 and the recent 20 samples capture the current high-demand regime while limiting influence from the low-demand early periods. Using recent_N increases the forecasted base stock and safety stock to match elevated demand, while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by not inflating estimates with older low-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2928.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. History shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) across many concluded periods and carry-over insights already confirm lead time = 0. On-hand = 55, in-transit = 0, so we must order to cover current-period demand plus replenish. Demand has exhibited a sustained upward regime since Period 12 with further lift around Period 23\u201326; to make the OR engine responsive to the recent, higher-demand regime I use recent_N on the most recent 20 demand samples (Periods 29\u201348) which captures the post-regime behavior while smoothing short blips. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently support that and the backend expects the promised lead time. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat increases the forecasted base_stock and the safety stock to reduce stockouts during this higher-demand regime; this trades slightly higher holding cost for much higher expected profit given profit >> holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1), which makes higher service preferable. Recent_N N=20 balances responsiveness and statistical stability (covers ~half the history and the sustained high-demand period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2930.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: recent realized demand has been in a higher regime vs early periods (sustained since Period 12 with further lifts around Period 23 and Period 26). Current on-hand=53, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments observed (lead time historically confirmed as 0). Promised lead time = 0 and historic concludes consistently show 0 - use default L to keep backend aligned with promise. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime and prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1), I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent data: use the last 10 demand observations (Periods 40\u201349) so the base_stock and cap respond to the elevated recent mean and volatility while avoiding over-reacting to single spikes. This raises the backend's mean demand forecast (improves fill rate) while sigma_hat from the same recent window captures current variability. This choice balances high per-unit profit (favoring higher service level) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute z* (based on profit vs holding) while providing an up-to-date mu_hat and sigma_hat reflecting the current high-demand regime.
