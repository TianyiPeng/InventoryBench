Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals yet; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [30,49,48,65,56] (mean=49.6, std\u224812.1). Promised lead time is the default; no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments yet. Using default methods: L=promised (stable until we observe concluded arrivals), mu_hat default \u2192 (1+L)*mean of all samples to capture average demand over review+lead period, sigma_hat default \u2192 sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples to reflect observed variability. This balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 high critical ratio) with holding costs by letting the OR backend compute base-stock using the full-sample mean/variance until we observe regime changes or delivery issues.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start: Period_2. History shows Period_1 order arrived in Period_1 (arrived=71, lead_time observed=0). Current on-hand=21, in-transit=0, no overdue or missing shipments. Historical demand samples (Period_1..5) give mean \u224849.6 and recent observed demand (Period_1 conclude demand=50) aligns with that mean \u2014 no sustained changepoint detected. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by observation, so use the default lead-time setting. To let the OR backend compute the base-stock using the full-sample mean and volatility (balanced against Profit=$19 and Holding=$1), I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This keeps the policy stable given no evidence of regime shift or lost shipments and ensures pipeline targets roughly one period of expected demand while respecting the backend cap.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date Period_3. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical sample demand (provided) has mean \u224849.6 (samples: 30,49,48,65,56). Concluded arrival history shows lead times observed so far are 0 periods (Period1 and Period2 orders both arrived same period). Period demands observed in conclude messages (50, 91) include a large spike in Period_2, but this is only one high period and does not yet constitute a sustained regime shift (require \u22653 periods). To avoid overreacting to a single spike while ensuring service for the immediate period, use estimated lead time computed from observed lead times (calculate -> average = 0) and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies the base-stock scaled to (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service level versus holding cost conservatively given limited evidence of a demand regime change. If the elevated demand continues in future concludes, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1113.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Recent realized demand from concluded periods: P1=50, P2=91, P3=60 (avg=67). On-hand=27, in-transit=0 so available inventory (27) is well below one-period demand at recent pace. Promised lead time=0 and concluded arrivals for P1-P3 show actual lead_time=0, so no lead-time inflation detected. I choose L.method="default" to trust promised lead time (0). I choose mu_hat.method="recent_N" with N=3 to rely on the most recent 3 concluded demand observations (captures the recent higher-demand regime: avg=67 units for the review+lead period). For sigma_hat I choose "recent_N" with N=3 to reflect recent demand variability (P1-P3 = 50,91,60). These settings tell the OR backend to target a base stock built around the recent mean and recent volatility, increasing order quantity relative to long-run historical mean while keeping lead-time at the confirmed 0. This balances service (avoid stockouts given the recent spike) against holding cost by using a short recent window rather than upweighting older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected over P1-P3: recent avg demand=67 vs prior sample mean=49.6 (+35%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Profit: $950.00, Daily Holding Cost: $53.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $897.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_5. Context: On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times for chips(Regular) are all 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P4 arrived same period), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand history shows a recent upward regime identified previously (carry-over): a changepoint was detected with a recent higher mean over the most recent 3 periods. To react conservatively to the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost small (holding $1 vs profit $19 \u2192 high service target), I use a recent_N forecast over the last 3 periods (regime length=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the recent regime. L is set to 'calculate' so the backend confirms lead time from observed conclues (which are all 0). This choice raises the base-stock to match the confirmed higher-demand regime and the high service quantile implied by the profit/holding ratio, while sigma based on the same recent window captures increased variability. Given on-hand=53 and no in-transit, this will prompt the OR engine to order up toward the recent-regime-driven base stock and avoid stockouts during the sustained higher-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1297.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: all concluded arrivals from Periods 1\u20135 show actual lead_time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period). On-hand = 33, in-transit = 0, recent demands (Periods 1\u20135) = [50, 91, 60, 50, 70], sample mean = 64.2. A demand upshift was previously detected (noted in carry-over): recent regime average ~67 vs prior ~49.6. Given confirmed same-period lead time and limited in-transit stock, I keep the lead-time estimate anchored to observed data and use overall-sample demand estimates so the OR backend's base-stock calculation captures the elevated mean while remaining robust to variability. This balances high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1): using the full-sample mean (default sigma) provides moderate safety stock without overstocking. If future concludes show continued higher demand, I'll shift to a recent_N or EWMA mu_hat to react faster.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1316.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 7. On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 for all observed orders (P1\u2013P6 arrived same period). Profit/holding imply very high service target (q = 19/(19+1)=0.95, z\u22481.645). There is a previously-detected demand regime shift beginning at Period 4 (sustained increase). Recent realized demands (Periods 4\u20136) = [50,70,70], avg \u2248 63.3, which is materially above earlier-period averages. Given the confirmed regime shift (sustained 3 periods) and zero observed lead time, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand forecasting, I use recent_N for mu_hat to capture the new, higher regime: choose N=3 (the regime length) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of the last 3 demands. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices keep the OR engine focused on the recent higher-demand regime while preserving the high service level implied by profit/holding tradeoff. With on-hand=14 and no in-transit, the backend's base-stock target (based on recent mean and volatility) will drive replenishment to cover the now-higher short-run demand while capping order size via its cap to limit overstock risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1577.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 context: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals from Periods 1-7 show actual lead time = 0 (orders ordered and arrived same period), so I trust lead time = 0. Recent realized customer demand has risen: Periods 5-7 demands = 70, 70, 106 (mean = 82.0) which is a sustained 3-period elevation versus earlier periods. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I set lead time by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand I use a recent_N approach over the most recent 3 periods (N=3) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands) = 1*82.0; this captures the recent upward regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=3 so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std(last 3). This combination raises the base-stock to reflect the higher realized demand while letting the capped order cap limit excessive orders; using recent_N keeps the policy responsive to the confirmed 3-period increase and balances profit vs holding cost given Holding=$1/unit and Profit=$19/unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg demand P5-P7 = 82.0 vs prior periods P1-P4 avg = 62.75 (+30.7%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $1183.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: recent concluded demands (P4-P8) = [50,70,70,106,65], recent 5-period mean = 72.2. On-hand = 52, in-transit = 0, so current visible supply is below one-period expected demand. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P8 arrived same period), so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. I choose L = default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent higher-demand regime (includes the large spike at P7); mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands centers the base-stock on recent demand rather than older low-demand samples. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability including the P7 spike, which increases safety stock. This combination raises the target base stock to cover the recent elevated demand while keeping holding cost in mind (holding cost is low relative to profit), aiming to maximize profit \xd7 units_sold minus holding cost. Ordering now will top up inventory to meet the next-period demand spike while avoiding stockouts given no in-transit units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1653.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 decision. Recent demand has trended higher since Period_5 (P5-9 demands = 70,70,106,65,88; recent 5-period mean = 79.8). Current inventory: on-hand=19, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this period; no overdue/lost shipments observed (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead times are all 0, so use default lead time. To reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime that began around Period_5 and to keep service (profit >> holding cost, q \u2248 0.95) high while controlling holding cost, I set mu_hat using a recent_N estimate over the last 5 demand periods (captures the new regime). Volatility also set using recent_N over the same 5 periods so the backend correctly scales safety stock. Methods chosen: L=default (use promised 0), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect upward shift and avoid diluting signal with older low-demand periods, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 so safety stock reflects current variability (not older low-variance data). These parameters push the OR engine toward higher base-stock (appropriate because profit is large relative to holding cost) while keeping cap constraints enforced by the backend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $832.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 context: promised lead time = 0; historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all concluded periods (P1\u2013P10). On-hand = 61, in-transit = 0, so available inventory currently covers roughly ~0.8\u20131.0 periods of recent demand (recent demand elevated vs early periods). Recent demand (Periods 6\u201310) shows higher and more volatile demand (70,106,65,88,47) so I bias forecasts to recent observations. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (concluded history confirms 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 6\u201310) so mu_hat reflects the most recent regime (average \u224875.2 units for one-period review+lead). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to capture elevated recent volatility. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat for elevated recent demand) against holding cost by not using all older low-demand periods that would understate current demand. With no in-transit stock and confirmed short lead time, the backend will compute base_stock from these recent estimates to place an order sufficient to cover the higher recent demand while limiting excess holding costs.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201311) shows all orders arriving same-period (observed lead_time = 0 each conclude). On-hand = 47, in-transit = 0, and recent average demand \u2248 69 units/period (mean of Periods 1\u201311 = 69.36). With promised lead time = 0 and confirmed actual lead time = 0 across concluded messages, I choose to use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base_stock from the full-sample mean/variance (captures full history and stability). This balances service level (profit=$19 >> holding=$1 so high fill rate desired) against holding cost by letting the OR formula set z* automatically. Using defaults also avoids overreacting to short fluctuations given no new sustained regime change since prior carry-over insights.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use promised lead time. Recent demand shows variability with several high-demand spikes (e.g., Period_7=106, Period_9=88, Period_12=112). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1), I bias the forecast to recent demand: use the last 5 periods (P8\u2013P12) to capture the most recent regime including the large P12 spike. Therefore: L=default (promised 0), mu_hat based on recent_N N=5 to focus the (1+L) forecast on the latest demand level, and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) with modest holding cost by not overreacting to single-period noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2223.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent history shows elevated demand in the last 3 periods (P11-P13: 66, 112, 118) after a generally lower prior run (P1-P10 avg ~69.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we have no coverage for current-period demand. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so use the promised/default lead time. To ensure the OR backend targets the now-higher realized demand while keeping safety stock responsive to recent volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (captures the confirmed 3-period high-demand regime). This raises the base-stock to match the new demand regime and increases variability estimate to improve service levels despite holding cost being low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1). Using recent_N (N=3) balances responsiveness to the confirmed regime shift while avoiding overreacting to a single spike.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg demand P11-P13 = 98.7 vs prior P1-P10 avg = 69.7 (+41%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $1874.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Recent history shows consistently short (0) actual lead times in concluded messages and multiple sustained demand regime shifts through Period 14 with elevated demand since Period 11 (user carry-over notes). Current on-hand = 45, in-transit = 0 \u2014 no arrivals are pending, so pipeline_inventory = 0. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals consistently report lead_time = 0, so I keep L at the default (promised) value. For demand forecast I use the backend defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the base-stock from the profit/holding tradeoff using all available demand history; given recent high-demand regimes the engine will upweight required safety stock through its z* calculation if profit dominates holding cost. Using defaults also avoids overreacting to short-term noise given multiple prior regime detections already recorded in carry-over insights. Finally, because there are no in-transit units, the OR engine can place orders to immediately replenish to the computed base stock as needed.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 context: on-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201315) show actual lead time = 0 every time (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand has been elevated and sustained: Periods 11\u201315 demands = [66, 112, 118, 101, 94], recent mean \u2248 98.2 versus earlier long-run average \u2248 69\u201370 (evidence of the regime shift already noted at Period 14). Because demand has stayed high for 5 consecutive periods, I bias the forecast toward the recent regime so the OR engine sets a higher base stock and avoids stockouts. Decisions: use default promised lead time (L=0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the confirmed high-demand regime (1+L times mean of the last 5 demands); use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base_stock (\u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302) to improve service level while the backend's cap still limits excessively large orders. With on-hand=18 and no in-transit, this will prompt ordering to cover the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in check.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start. Recent realized demands (P11-P16) are: 66,112,118,101,94,88 \u2014 this indicates a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 11 (previously recorded). All concluded orders show actual lead time = 0 periods, so use promised lead time (default). To capture the elevated demand level while being responsive to the most recent six periods (regime length = 6), I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 6 samples). This balances service (higher mean \u2192 higher base stock) against holding cost by using a recent-sample estimate rather than the full-history mean, avoiding overreaction to older lower-demand periods. L uses "default" since observed lead times have consistently been 0 in concluded messages, so no adjustment for lead time is needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2132.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. Recent demand has been elevated versus the earliest samples: last 5 demands (Periods 13-17) = [118, 101, 94, 88, 113], recent mean \u2248 102.8 and recent std moderate. All concluded arrivals show lead_time = 0 historically (every concluded arrival had lead_time 0). On-hand = 15, in-transit = 0 so pipeline is empty; next-period demand likely near the recent mean (\u2248103), so without ordering we will stockout. I choose L via 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time = 0 from concluded history. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime evident since ~Period 11\u201314 and avoid diluting the forecast with much older, lower-demand periods. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to protect service against the elevated recent demand while keeping holding costs in check by using only recent data rather than all historical samples.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 context: recent demand has been elevated vs early history. Last 5 realized demands (Periods 14\u201318) = [101, 94, 88, 113, 116], recent mean = 102.4 units/period, recent variability evident. All concluded lead times = 0 (no delays observed), on-hand=8, in-transit=0. I choose L=default because concluded history consistently shows promised lead time = 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime that began around Period 11 and is still present; this yields (1+L)*mean \u2248 102.4 and prevents understocking. For uncertainty I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility (sd computed over the same recent window). This combination biases the OR engine toward higher base stock to protect service given high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1) while avoiding overly long tails from older lower-demand periods. With on-hand=8 and no in-transit, these parameters will drive the backend to replenish to cover the elevated recent demand while keeping holding cost in check.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every past order arrived with lead_time=0 (all concluded lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been elevated (Periods 15-19 demands = 94, 88, 113, 116, 122) \u2014 last 5-period mean = 106.6, indicating a sustained higher regime vs earlier periods. Profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1) implies a high target service level (q\u22480.95) so we should size the base-stock to meet recent higher demand and keep safety stock. Therefore: L = default (promised 0). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated recent mean ((1+L)*mean of last 5). For sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 so the backend computes volatility from the same recent window. These choices ensure the OR engine targets a high service level appropriate to high profit while reflecting the recent demand spike; they also respond to extremely low on-hand (1) and zero in-transit by increasing the forecasted pipeline requirement.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 11 (P11-P20 demands: 66,112,118,101,94,88,113,116,122,111). On-hand = 20, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is low relative to recent demand (single-period average ~103 across last 10). All concluded messages P1\u2013P20 show arrivals occurred same period as ordered (observed lead_time = 0 consistently). To ensure the OR backend targets service with the confirmed higher-demand regime, I set lead time via calculate (so backend uses observed average lead time), and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (N=10 periods, P11\u2013P20) to capture the sustained elevated mean and current volatility. This raises the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under current demand, improving fill rates while the sigma estimate supports a safety-stock buffer. Using recent data avoids dilution from older, lower-demand periods and addresses the zero in-transit position by signaling higher replenishment targets.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (all orders arrived same period ordered). Recent demand has clearly shifted upward: last 5 demands (Periods 17-21) = [113,116,122,111,155], average = 123.4 units, substantially above the prior-period average (Periods 1-16 mean = 79.75). Because arrivals have been reliable and lead time remains 0, I keep L as default (promised lead time). To ensure the OR backend targets the new higher demand while limiting holding costs, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (the detected recent regime length). Using the last 5 observations focuses the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime and increases the base-stock recommendation; using recent volatility (sigma_hat recent_N) raises safety stock to cover observed variability. This balances service level (capture high sales/profit of $19/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) given zero lead time and no pipeline inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg demand P17-P21 = 123.4 vs prior P1-P16 avg = 79.75 (+54.7%), sustained for 5 periods

=== Period 22 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $2186.00

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23. On-hand = 37, in-transit = 0. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals through Period 22 show actual lead time = 0 historically (every concluded arrival lists lead_time 0). Demand has undergone several sustained upward shifts; most recent confirmed regime change was at Period 17 (user-provided): avg demand P17-P21 = 123.4, sustained 5 periods. Recent realized demands (P18-P22) = [116, 122, 111, 155, 117], which continue to show elevated demand vs early periods. To respond quickly with minimal holding cost given lead time 0 and high profit/holding ratio (profit $19, holding $1), I bias the forecast to recent realized demand. I set L = default to keep promised lead time (0) since concluded history confirms actual lead time 0. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (capture the most recent elevated regime length = 5 periods) so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean of the last 5 demands; this focuses the base stock on the currently higher demand level. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=5 so variability is estimated from the same recent window. These choices keep service levels high during the sustained high-demand regime while avoiding excessive long-term holding by not using the full historical (lower) mean.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 context: on-hand=33, in-transit=0, profit=$19, holding=$1. Historical conclude messages show every order has arrived with lead_time=0 consistently (no delayed or lost shipments observed), so promised lead time remains accurate. Recent observed demand has shifted into a higher regime (noted previously starting around Period 17 with sustained high demands through Period 23). To ensure the OR backend targets the current high-demand regime while keeping holding costs reasonable, I use the default lead time (promised=0) and compute demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 5 periods (captures the recent high-demand regime length ~5 periods). Choosing recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat gives the backend an updated (1+L)-period mean and std that reflect the elevated demand, improving service levels without over-accumulating inventory given current on-hand=33 and zero in-transit.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 decision. Context: on-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all prior periods (orders placed arrived same period), so I use the default (promised) lead time. Recent demand has been elevated: the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 20-24 = 111, 155, 117, 121, 126) average 126, well above earlier-period averages. Profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), so we prioritize service level and therefore set the demand forecast using a recent-window estimate to capture the higher current demand and increased volatility. I choose recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime (captures mean and variability over last 5 periods). This increases base_stock to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N increases the safety-stock term to reflect observed variability; using promised L keeps pipeline calculation consistent with observed 0 lead time. No overdue shipments are visible (no in-transit), so no explicit lead-time correction is applied.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2585.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Recent history shows consistently zero actual lead time (every concluded arrival lists lead_time = 0). On-hand = 18, in-transit = 0, so no confirmed incoming stock for this period. Demand has stepped up over time (recent periods 17\u201325 show substantially higher demands vs early periods), and prior carry-over insights already record multiple sustained demand regime shifts. Given the complete sequence of concluded arrivals all showing lead_time = 0, I will use the default promised lead time so the OR backend treats L as promised (0). For demand mean and volatility I choose the defaults so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) using the full historical demand record: this leverages all available data, lets the OR engine compute the base-stock and the capped order quantity, and avoids overfitting to a very short recent window. This approach balances service level (by including observed elevated recent demand in the full-sample mean) with holding cost via the backend's q-based z* and cap. No shipments appear overdue or lost in the concluded history, so no explicit lead-time correction is applied.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1658.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: on-hand=52, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Historical concludes for Periods 1\u201326 consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0 (no delayed or lost shipments observed), so use the promised lead time. Recent demand has been at a higher regime: last 6 periods (P21\u2013P26) demands = [155,117,121,126,137,90], mean = 124.33 units. I choose L='default' (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0. For mu_hat I select recent_N with N=6 to capture the currently elevated demand regime; backend will compute (1+L)*mean_recent = 1*124.33. For sigma_hat I also select recent_N with N=6 so variability reflects recent volatility (this helps the OR engine size safety stock appropriately). This configuration balances service (high recent demand means higher target base stock) against holding costs (holding cost is low $1 relative to profit $19, so we accept higher stock to avoid lost sales). No overdue shipments or lost orders to account for.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1980.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent demand has been elevated relative to early periods; last 5 realized demands (Periods 23-27) = [121, 126, 137, 90, 107], recent mean = 116.2. On-hand = 53, in-transit = 0 so no pending arrivals; all historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 consistently. I therefore use the promised/default lead time to keep pipeline assumptions aligned with observed arrivals. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and ensure adequate service (profit >> holding cost), I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent demand regime while meeting the N selection rules). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect current demand volatility. These parameters raise the backend base-stock toward recent demand levels (improving fill rates and profit), while capping orders via the OR engine's cap and keeping holding cost sensitivity through the backend z* calculation (profit $19 vs holding $1 favors higher service level). No overdue or lost shipments are observed, so no lead-time correction is applied.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 decision. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201328) show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so I keep L at the promised/default (0). On-hand = 12, in-transit = 0 \u2192 there are no confirmed incoming units visible to me for Period_29. Demand history shows a prolonged higher-demand regime in recent periods, but those regime shifts are already recorded in prior carry-over insights. I choose default methods so the OR backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat using the full sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This lets the backend balance profit vs holding cost using its standard base-stock formula while relying on observed zero lead time. If shipments begin to miss/conclude differently, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit lead-time estimate in future periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so I keep L as default (promised lead time). Demand has undergone sustained upward shifts (most recently the regime change documented around Period 17 leading to much higher average demand through Period 29). To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates, basing the estimate on the most recent 13 observed demand periods (Periods 17\u201329 inclusive; regime length = 13). This focuses the base-stock target on current elevated demand and reduces risk of understocking given zero pipeline and no incoming arrivals visible. Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=13) aligns uncertainty with recent variability rather than diluting it with older, lower-demand periods. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given high profit ($19/unit) and low holding cost ($1/unit), while letting the OR backend cap orders via its cap rule to limit excessive inventory build-up.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31 context: on-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0), so promised lead time appears accurate. Demand has undergone sustained upward regime shifts (user carry-over shows recent sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 17 with avg ~123 over P17-P21 and continued high demand through P30). To avoid stockouts given low on-hand and no pipeline, we should set L to default (use promised lead time=0). For demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N methods focused on the most recent periods to capture the sustained high-demand regime; I select N=9 (roughly P22\u2013P30) to cover the post-regime data while respecting the regime detection guidance. This raises the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast to reflect the higher recent demand and increases safety stock via the recent volatility estimate. These choices prioritize avoiding lost sales (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while limiting excess inventory by using recent data rather than the long-run mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3021.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32 start. All concluded arrivals through Period_31 show actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order: arrived same period ordered). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover immediate (same-period) demand. Recent demand has been elevated: last 5 demands (P27-P31) = [107,135,161,132,165], mean = 140. Given confirmed same-period lead time, set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 periods = 1*140, capturing the recent high-demand regime and avoiding dilution by older, lower-demand periods. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility around the elevated mean. This choice prioritizes service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) by sizing base stock to recent realized demand while keeping holding-cost sensitivity via the OR backend's q formula; using recent samples helps the backend avoid understocking given the clear, sustained uptick in demand observed across recent periods. No evidence of lost or delayed shipments\u2014arrivals consistently matched orders with lead_time=0.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent demand has been consistently high over the last several periods (Period 28-32 demands = 135, 161, 132, 165, 116) and earlier carry-over notes show multiple sustained upward regime shifts through Period 22. All concluded orders historically show lead_time = 0 (every conclude message lists lead_time was 0), so actual lead time is confirmed as same-period. On-hand = 63, in-transit = 0; with lead time 0 the OR engine must cover current-period demand only, but we still want a short buffer because demand variance is elevated. I set L = default to use the promised/confirmed lead time (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the last 5 periods (Period 28-32) to capture the current high-demand regime without diluting with older lower-demand history. I also set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so safety stock reflects the elevated recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward higher service (capturing recent higher mean and variance) while keeping holding cost controlled by only using a short recent window rather than the full historical average.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning around Period 22 (user carry-over notes) with demands frequently exceeding 120 and several peaks ~160-180 in the most recent periods. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so there is no pipeline coverage for current-period demand; any order placed now must cover this period's demand (review+lead coverage). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so I will trust the promised lead time (default) rather than lengthen L. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (average demand across the (1+L) review+lead window based on the most recent regime). I choose N=11 (Period 23\u201333 inclusive is the recent high-demand regime length) so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 11 samples; similarly use recent_N N=11 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to protect service level during the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping L at the trusted promised value to avoid overestimating lead time and unnecessary holding cost. No new missing shipments or lead-time changes detected in the conclude history.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Recent demand has been elevated versus early periods; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 30-34) = [132,165,116,179,131], mean=144.6, std\u224826.3. On-hand=46, in-transit=0, no overdue or missing arrivals (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so I keep L as default (promised=0). To react quickly to the current higher-demand regime while limiting exposure to holding cost, I set mu_hat using a recent_N = 5 (captures the most recent demand regime; N=5 is within the recommended bounds and matches the recent sustained elevated demand). I also set sigma_hat using recent_N = 5 to reflect current volatility (std\u224826.3 over last 5). These settings push the OR backend to target a base-stock roughly equal to one period's recent demand plus safety stock proportional to current volatility, which balances the high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) and the observed higher demand. No delayed shipments to adjust for.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Recent demand has been higher than early-sample averages (last 5 demands: P31-P35 = 165,116,179,131,144; mean \u2248147). On-hand = 44, in-transit = 0, so we currently have less than a single period of recent demand on-hand. All concluded arrivals historically show lead_time = 0 (orders placed have consistently arrived same period), so I retain the promised lead time. To align the OR engine with the recent higher-demand regime and to avoid stockouts, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most recent 5 samples. This raises the base-stock level to reflect elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent data keeps safety stock responsive to recent volatility. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), prioritizing service (higher mu_hat) reduces lost sales value more than the incremental holding cost.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37 decision. Recent demand is elevated versus the full-sample mean (multiple prior carry-over insights record sustained regime shifts through Period_22). All concluded orders show actual lead time = 0 historically (every concluded message reports lead_time 0), so I keep L at the promised/default. Current inventory: on-hand = 9, in-transit = 0 \u2192 very low cover versus recent demand (recent demands in the last several periods: P32-P36 demand = 116,179,131,144,180). To better capture the current higher-demand regime and reduce stockouts, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base_stock from the most recent 5 demand samples (this raises the forecast mean and volatility compared with the long-run average). This balances profit-driven service (profit=$19 >> holding=$1) by biasing toward higher service level while keeping the capped order size in place. Using default L avoids introducing artificial lead-time buffer since no evidence of delayed or lost shipments exists in concluded history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3762.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to meet the current higher demand regime visible in recent periods. Historical conclude messages show consistently zero lead time (orders arriving same period), so I keep L at the promised/default value (0). Demand has clearly shifted up in the most recent ~8 periods (Periods 30\u201337: demands = [132,165,116,179,131,144,180,199]; recent mean = 155.75 units, recent sample std \u2248 29.2). Because the recent upward regime is sustained and materially higher than older data, I use a recent_N forecast for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to make the base-stock (and cap) responsive to the current higher mean and observed volatility. This approach raises the target inventory to reduce stockouts while the low holding cost ($1 vs profit $19) tolerates higher on-hand inventory. Using default lead time keeps the backend assumptions consistent with observed concludes (LT=0), while recent_N for demand captures the regime shift and shortens the memory window to avoid dilution by older, lower-demand periods. No in-transit units are visible, so the order recommendation will aim to bring pipeline+on-hand up toward the new base-stock implied by the recent regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 decision. Recent demand has been high (Periods 34-38 = 131,144,180,199,171; recent 5-period avg \u2248165), and on-hand=33, in-transit=0 so we currently have very little coverage vs. recent demand. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrived lead_time=0 for all past orders (every concluded arrival lists lead_time 0), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Given the confirmed 0 lead time and no clear new sustained regime shift beyond those already recorded, I will let the OR backend compute demand parameters from the full sample set (default methods). This lets the backend combine long-run demand stats with the known lead time to compute base_stock and the capped order. Using defaults avoids over-reacting to short-term noise while the backend's formula (base_stock = mu_hat + z*\xb7sigma_hat) will trade off the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost. Note risk: current on-hand (33) is well below recent-period demand (~165), so the computed order may be large to restore service level given profit > holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Demand has shown multiple upward regime shifts; most recently periods 30-39 show a sustained high-demand regime (10 periods). To capture the current elevated demand I set mu_hat using a recent_N window of the last 10 periods (Periods 30-39) so the OR backend base_stock reflects the current higher mean rather than the long-run average. Volatility also appears higher in the same recent window, so I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 to reflect current variability. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service level (avoid stockouts in current high-demand regime) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent mean and variance rather than inflating targets with older low-demand periods. L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 consistently.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand P30-P39 = 159.6 vs prior P1-P29 avg = 94.0 (+69.7%), sustained for 10 periods

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 context: on-hand=29, in-transit=0. Recent history shows the elevated demand regime established around Period 30 (carry-over: avg P30-P39 = 159.6, and Period 40 demand=176). All concluded orders historically had lead_time=0, so promised lead time remains credible. Given the clear, sustained high-demand regime over the last ~11 periods (Periods 30\u201340), I use a recent-window forecast so the OR backend targets the current higher demand level rather than long-run lower means. Decisions: L=default to respect the promised 0-period lead time (supported by all concluded arrivals). For mu_hat I select recent_N with N=11 to capture the last 11 periods (Periods 30\u201340) where demand averaged ~160+; this sets (1+L)\xd7mean over the current regime. For sigma_hat I also select recent_N N=11 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This combination raises the base-stock to meet the new demand regime while keeping safety stock consistent with recent variability; with profit >> holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1) the backend will choose a high service quantile but the recent_N choices avoid diluting responsiveness with older low-demand data. With on-hand=29 and no in-transit, these parameters will prompt replenishment to cover the (1+L)-period demand at the higher recent mean and appropriate safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2635.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 context: on-hand=63, in-transit=0, profit=$19, holding=$1. Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time observed = 0 repeatedly), so promised lead time = 0 is confirmed. Recent demand (Periods 37-41) = [199, 171, 179, 176, 142], recent 5-period mean = 173.4 which is higher than earlier regimes and represents the current demand regime. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time 0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and ensure the OR engine sizes the base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand using the most recent, relevant data. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent volatility (std of recent five = about 21.6), avoiding dilution from older low-demand periods. These choices bias orders toward meeting the current elevated demand while keeping holding cost in check by not over-weighting distant historical low-demand periods. With on-hand=63 and zero pipeline, the backend will compute base_stock from the recent demand estimate and the q-derived z to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders in prior periods arrived same period). Demand has been in a higher regime for many periods (carry-over notes: sustained increases culminating in ~160+ avg in P30-P39). Recent realized demand (Periods 38-42 = 171,179,176,142,193) remains elevated and volatile; the most relevant signal for the next (L+1) period is the very recent average. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0, consistent with concluded history) so the OR backend assumes same-period arrivals. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the immediate elevated demand level without diluting by older lower-demand periods; this sets the review+lead demand forecast to (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demands. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current volatility observed in the last 5 periods. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to protect service given high profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), while using a short recent window to avoid over-committing to outdated lower-demand history. I note there are no in-transit units and will monitor arrivals in the next conclude message to confirm continued lead-time=0 behavior.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 context: recent concluded history shows consistently zero actual lead time (all concluded arrivals report lead_time = 0). On-hand = 38, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is low relative to the high-demand regime established since Period 30 (carry-over insight: elevated demand ~160 avg in P30-P39). Promised lead time = 0 and observed lead time history confirms same-period arrivals; no evidence of delays or lost shipments. To let the OR backend use the full long-run demand statistics and the promised lead time, I select default methods: L default (use promised lead time = 0), mu_hat default ((1+L) \xd7 mean of all samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L) \xd7 std of all samples). This keeps the model anchored to the complete sample set while the backend's capped policy will limit extreme orders; it balances service level given high profit ($19) versus holding cost ($1) without overreacting to short-term noise. Given no in-transit stock and elevated recent demand, the backend will raise base-stock via the data-driven defaults to restore on-hand coverage.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 start. On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1-P44) show actual lead_time consistently 0 (every concluded arrival lists lead_time=0), so I trust promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 40-44 = 176, 142, 193, 166, 181) remains substantially higher than early-sample means and reflects the sustained high-demand regime already captured in carry-over insights. To avoid stockouts given very low on-hand and high recent demand, I set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast I prioritize the most recent 5 periods to capture the current elevated regime: mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5. Volatility is similarly taken from the last 5 samples (recent_N N=5) so the OR engine's safety stock and cap reflect current variability. This raises the base-stock target to reduce lost sales while the holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so biasing toward higher service is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3816.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 decision. Context: on-hand=3, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. All concluded orders (Periods 1\u201345) arrived with lead_time=0, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0 \u2014 same-period arrival. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 30 (documented in carry-over notes). To keep service while avoiding excessive holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1), I use a recent-window demand estimate so the OR backend targets inventory to the current high-demand regime rather than the full-sample average. Therefore: L set to default (promised 0). mu_hat uses recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 30\u201345) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last N samples; N=16 equals the regime length and captures the confirmed higher mean. sigma_hat uses recent_N with the same N=16 to reflect recent volatility; this tightens safety stock around current variability. These choices ensure the base-stock reflects the elevated demand pattern while the OR engine's cap limits extreme orders, balancing service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. On-hand = 65, in-transit = 0. Historical conclude messages for Periods 1\u201346 consistently show arrived orders with observed lead_time = 0 (every concluded order lists lead_time 0), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand has been elevated for many periods per provided carry-over history, but no new sustained changepoint (3+ new periods) is visible since the last recorded insight. Given confirmed L=0 and broad historical demand samples, use the backend defaults so the OR engine calculates base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma based on all samples; this leverages all available demand history and the confirmed zero lead time. Using defaults keeps orders responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff automatically. Current pipeline = on-hand + in-transit = 65; with no in-transit, orders will top up per the backend-calculated base stock.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order from P1\u2013P47 arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 consistently), so promised lead time=0 is reliable. Recent demand has been high (P30\u2013P47 trend captured in prior insights), but no new sustained changepoint confirmed in concluded history. No overdue or missing shipments to account for. I select default lead time so backend uses the promised L=0. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the full sample set and the engine's capped order cap to trade off service level (profit-driven q) versus holding cost. Given on-hand+pipeline=0, the backend will order toward the computed base-stock to cover current period demand while capping extreme orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3724.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. Recent history shows consistently zero realized lead time (all concluded arrivals report lead_time = 0) and strong, sustained demand growth recorded in game carry-over insights (multiple regime shifts earlier). Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0 so no arrivals expected this period; we must cover current period demand plus replenishment exposure. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use default lead time. To keep the OR backend aligned with historical sample statistics (and because the supplied carry-over insights already document the demand regime shifts), use default demand and volatility calculations so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1 encourages availability) with holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the appropriate z* safety factor from profit/(profit+holding). No overdue or lost shipments are present to justify explicit lead-time extension or manual overrides.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3660.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50. Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed concluded lead_time = 0 for all recorded orders), and demand has been elevated for many periods (recent demands ~150-200 range) but these regime shifts were already captured in previous carry-over insights. Current on-hand = 7, in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to cover this period's demand immediately (lead time = 0 means same-period arrival). Profit $19 / holding $1 implies a very high target service quantile (q = 19/20 = 0.95) so the OR backend will compute a high z. Because actual lead time is confirmed as 0 across concluded history and we have a long, varied demand history, I select default methods so the backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while letting the OR engine compute the appropriate base-stock and cap given the high service target. No evidence of lost shipments or a new sustained demand/lead-time changepoint in the most recent concluded period, but note low on-hand and zero in-transit so orders should replenish immediately under lead time 0.
