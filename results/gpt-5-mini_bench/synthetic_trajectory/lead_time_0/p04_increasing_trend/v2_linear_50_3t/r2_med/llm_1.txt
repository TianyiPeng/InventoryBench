The 5-period average \u224849.6 units/period with some upward fluctuation but no sustained abrupt regime shift (variation between 30 and 65). c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0, but actual lead time can differ and must be inferred from conclude messages later. Currently there are no concluded arrivals or in-transit units, so we cannot confirm actual lead time; treat arrival as uncertain but assume planning target of covering the next period's expected demand. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so there is no available stock to meet Period_1 demand. Holding cost is $1/unit/period and profit is $4/unit \u2014 it's profitable to sell but excess inventory increases holding cost. e) Final order logic: Forecast next-period demand \u224850 units (5-period mean ~49.6). Because we have zero on-hand and zero in-transit, place an order to cover expected demand for the coming period while avoiding large excess inventory given holding cost. Order 50 units.",

  "rationale": "a) World/calendar/product: No calendar dates or special events provided beyond generic Period_2. Product is regular chips \u2014 typically stable, no seasonal spike evident.\nb) Demand regime analysis: Historical sample series supplied in game instructions shows Period_2 demand ~49 (samples: P1:30, P2:49, P3:48, P4:65, P5:56). Actual observed demand in Period 1 was 50 (sold 50). This recent sale (50) and the historic Period_2 sample (~49) indicate expected demand for this period is about 49\u201350 units.\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Period 1 order (50) arrived in-period and conclude message shows lead_time = 0 observed. No in-transit inventory. This single observation is consistent with supplier-promised lead_time=0. (Not enough sustained periods to record a carry-over insight.)\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive in this same period's arrival resolution and can satisfy current-period demand. Holding cost is $1/unit/period; profit per sold unit is $4. The marginal net gain from a unit that sells this period is +$4 (profit) and if it doesn't sell this period, it still costs $1 holding (and may or may not sell later). Given high probability demand near 49\u201350, stocking to meet expected demand maximizes expected reward.\ne) Final order logic: Target to cover expected demand this period (49\u201350). Given recent actual sale = 50 and the historical sample for Period_2 ~49, I choose to order 50 units to meet likely demand while avoiding unnecessary excess holding. This balances service level (capture sales at $4 profit each) against $1 holding cost on any leftover.\n",

Conservatively treat expected demand as elevated relative to P1. c) Lead time / arrivals: Both concluded arrivals (P1 and P2) show orders arriving in the same period (ordered on Period 1 arrived Period 1; ordered on Period 2 arrived Period 2).

Recent sample average = 64.2; sorted sample = [50,50,60,70,91]. Demand is variable with occasional spikes (P2=91). c) Lead time & pipeline: Carry-over previously confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive during the same period and can satisfy that period's demand). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order placed now will arrive in Period_6 and can meet Period_6 demand. d) Inventory & risk tradeoffs: Profit per sold unit = $4; holding cost = $1 per unit/period for ending inventory. Understock cost (lost profit) = $4 per unit; overstock cost = $1 per unit.

Demand regime analysis: use observed concluded demands (these are authoritative). Concluded demands: P2=91, P3=60, P4=50, P5=70, P6=70. The most recent 3\u20134 periods (P3\u2013P6) average \u224862.5; including P2 gives a 5-period average \u224868.2. The recent two periods (P5\u2013P6) were 70, indicating a near-term expectation around 68\u201370 units. Lead time & pipeline: carry-over already confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive during the same period and will be available to meet Period_7 demand). Current inventory: on-hand = 15, in-transit = 0. Decision logic: with L=0 we must ensure on-hand + order covers expected demand for the current period (L+1 = 1 period). Forecast demand \u224868 units. To avoid stockouts (lost profitable sales at $4 profit each) while limiting holding cost ($1/unit/period), target total available \u224868. Therefore order = max(0, forecast - on-hand) = 68 - 15 = 53 units. This balances capturing expected profitable sales while minimizing end-of-period holding cost. If demand materializes closer to 70, a small shortfall of up to 2 units is acceptable versus extra holding cost. If you prefer slightly more safety, add a few units, but given holding penalty we choose the forecast-matching quantity.",

We must place an order to cover current-period demand (L+1 = 1 period) plus minimal safety to avoid stockout given variance. Holding cost = $1/unit/period; profit = $4/unit sold.
