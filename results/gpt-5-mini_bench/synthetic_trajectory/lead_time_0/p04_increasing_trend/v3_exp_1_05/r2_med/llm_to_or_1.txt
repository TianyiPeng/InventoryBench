Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrival history to infer actual lead time. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show a modest upward trend across the five samples (103, 81, 107, 127, 160) but only 5 points \u2014 not yet a sustained regime shift. Promised lead time is 0 and there are no concluded arrivals to contradict that, so use default lead time. To keep the OR engine aligned with available history and avoid overfitting to a small recent spike, use default demand/volatility computations: mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This provides a balanced base-stock target reflecting all observed demand while letting the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff and its cap. Monitor future conclude messages for any confirmed lead-time changes or sustained demand regime shifts and adjust to recent_N or explicit methods if/when evidence (\u22653 periods) accumulates.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2. Recent demand samples for chips(Regular) show mean ~115.6 units/period (samples: 103,81,107,127,160). Inventory: on-hand=18, in-transit=0. Profit per unit = $4, holding cost = $1 \u2192 service-level q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 so backend will target a high fill rate. Historical conclude shows the Period 1 order (ordered P1) arrived in P1 (lead_time=0), confirming promised same-period lead time so far. I choose to let the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) and use default demand aggregation (default) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances capturing all available demand history while relying on confirmed lead-time behavior; it keeps safety stock moderate given relatively high profit and low holding cost. Given on-hand=18 and no in-transit, the engine will order toward the base_stock implied by full-sample stats.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived in Period 1, lead_time=0)

Daily Reward (R_t): $315.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 context: on-hand=49, in-transit=0, observed demands in concluded history P1=123, P2=91. Historical sample set (provided) has mean=115.6 and std\u224826.58. Both concluded arrivals (P1 and P2) show lead_time=0, so I trust that actual lead time is 0. I choose L by 'calculate' (average of observed lead times = 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand forecasting I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging the provided historical sample pool mean\u2248115.6 and std\u224826.6). This keeps the base-stock rooted in the longer historical sample while the zero lead time keeps the review+lead period short; with on-hand=49 and no in-transit, the backend will place orders to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the base stock, balancing the $4 profit per unit vs $1 holding cost per unit-period. No evidence of lost shipments or regime shift beyond the confirmed lead_time=0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $459.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision. Recent concluded history shows arrivals for Periods 1\u20133 all had lead_time=0 (orders placed in each period arrived in the same period), and on-hand = 17, in-transit = 0. Demand history (reference samples) has mean ~115.6 units/period (samples: 103,81,107,127,160) and recent realized demands (concluded) are 123, 91, 119 (mean ~111). Given three consecutive confirmed same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost or delayed shipments, I will set lead time based on observed data (calculate). With L=0, using the default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) gives the OR engine a robust baseline forecast centered on the longer-sample mean (115.6) while preserving measured variability. This raises the base-stock level to cover expected same-period demand without overstating lead-time risk. Operationally: current on-hand (17) + in-transit (0) is well below the forecasted single-period demand; the OR backend will compute base_stock and capped order size accordingly. These parameter choices prioritize service (high profit per unit $4 vs holding $1) while letting the OR cap limit order size to avoid excessive holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Recent demand samples: [103, 81, 107, 127, 160] (mean=115.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; previous periods show consistent same-period arrivals (Periods 1-4 arrivals matched orders), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1 implies a high service quantile (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8). No sustained (>3 periods) regime shift in demand mean or variance detected despite a recent uptick in Periods 4-5, so I retain the default demand aggregation. To keep service level high while controlling inventory cost, I use the backend defaults: L=default (promised lead time 0), mu_hat=default ((1+L)*mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). This gives the OR engine a stable base-stock target reflecting all historical samples and the high service-level implied by profit vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $263.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision with on-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently show arrivals same period (confirmed lead time = 0 in prior periods), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history (samples provided) has mean 115.6 units/period and moderate volatility (std ~26.6). With L=0 the backend's default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean gives ~115.6, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std gives ~26.6. Using the defaults keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to the full-sample mean/variance; this balances the high profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1) by letting the backend compute the service-level quantile (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/5 = 0.8) while avoiding overreacting to recent single-period fluctuations. Given on-hand=57 and no in-transit, this policy will top up toward the statistically justified base stock while avoiding excessive holding cost from over-ordering.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent concluded history shows arrivals for Periods 1\u20136 with observed lead_time=0 each time. Demand history (concluded) for Periods 1\u20136: 123, 91, 119, 137, 80, 143 \u2014 variable but no sustained regime shift detected. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals consistently confirm that. There are no overdue or missing shipments to reconcile. Given consistent evidence of 0-period actual lead time, I set L using the calculate method to leverage observed lead-time data. For demand parameters I choose default methods: mu_hat default = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level (using the full-sample mean/variance) against holding costs given no clear recent demand regime change and confirmed same-period arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: on-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods 1-7) = [123, 91, 119, 137, 80, 143, 122]. Promised lead time = 0 and prior concluded messages repeatedly show arrivals same period (lead_time=0 confirmed), so use default lead time (promised). Recent demand shows elevated and variable sales in the last several periods (Periods 3-7 mostly above ~115 except Period 5=80). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I bias the demand estimate toward recent history: use a recent_N forecast using the last 5 periods to capture the more current regime (Periods 3-7: [119,137,80,143,122], mean ~120). Sigma will also be estimated from the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. These settings give the OR backend a (1+L)-adjusted mean based on recent demand and a volatility reflecting the recent regime, balancing the profit-driven service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost and low on-hand inventory. I expect the backend to compute base_stock from these inputs and cap orders appropriately. No evidence of lost shipments (arrivals always concluded), so no explicit lead-time adjustment is needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $344.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=44, in-transit=0, recent concluded demands (Periods1-8) = [123,91,119,137,80,143,122,97]. Every concluded arrival since Period1 shows lead_time=0 (consistent, no missed shipments). No sustained changepoint in demand (variation but no 3+ period shift up or down), so I keep the backend defaults so it uses the full-sample mean/variance with promised lead time. Using L=default (promised 0) aligns with repeated confirmed 0-period arrivals; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples to produce the base-stock. This balances service level (profit/holding ratio embedded in OR) while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise given current on-hand of 44 and zero in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $544.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 decision: recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20139) shows every order arrived in the same period it was placed (lead_time=0 repeatedly). Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no incoming supply will satisfy Period 10 demand unless we order now. Profit= $4, holding cost= $1 \u2192 critical ratio q=4/(4+1)=0.8 implying a high service level (we want to stock to avoid lost sales). I will set L using 'calculate' so the backend infers the observed average lead time from concluded history (which will be ~0). For demand forecast and variability I'll use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because we have 9 concluded demand observations with no clear sustained demand regime shift that would justify a recent-N or EWMA override. These choices push the OR engine to compute a base-stock that balances the high desired service level against holding costs given the empirical mean and variance. Given on-hand=0 and no in-transit, this will produce an order this period to cover (1+L) periods of demand per the backend formula.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201310) show every order arrived in the same period it was placed (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Recent demand history (Periods 1\u201310) shows variability but no sustained (>3 periods) upward regime shift; short spikes in Periods 9\u201310 are not long enough to justify changing the demand model. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no sustained changepoint, I choose the default, aggregate-statistics-based settings so the OR backend uses all samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (by using full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost and leverages the verified same-period arrivals to avoid over-estimating pipeline. With on-hand and in-transit both zero, the backend will compute the base-stock order to cover (1+L) demand using full-sample statistics.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 context: recent demand has risen over the last 3 periods (P9=149, P10=182, P11=145 \u2192 avg\u2248158.7) compared with the longer-run mean (~126). On-hand=2, in-transit=0 so we currently have virtually no cover for the upcoming period. Lead time evidence: all concluded periods show arrivals in the same period they were ordered (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect the confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I detect a recent upward regime beginning at Period 9 that has persisted for 3 periods, so I use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat to make the OR engine target the higher short-term demand (mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 demands). I also use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices ensure the backend raises the base-stock to cover the higher realized demand while keeping holding exposure limited because the regime evidence is just 3 periods long (conservative), and lead time is estimated from observed arrivals (0) so we don't over-order for hidden in-transit delays.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 decision: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times from Period 1\u201312 are consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so promised lead time=0 remains appropriate. Recent demand has risen materially: Periods 9\u201312 demands = [149, 182, 145, 177], average = 163.25, which is ~43% above the earlier Periods 1\u20138 average (~114). With no pipeline inventory and a sustained higher-demand regime for 4 periods, I increase the forecast to focus on recent performance to avoid stockouts. Therefore: set L to default (promised lead time 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (this yields (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 samples). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=4 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices raise the base-stock target and the capped order cap appropriately to reduce lost sales risk while the holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) tradeoff is handled by the backend via its service-level mapping.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: avg demand increased from ~114 (Periods 1\u20138) to 163.25 (Periods 9\u201312), +43.2%; sustainment: 4 periods (P9\u2013P12).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 decision. Recent demand has shifted up since Period 9; last 5 demands (P9\u2013P13 = 149,182,145,177,177) average ~166 units, higher than earlier periods. On-hand=3, in-transit=0 so we are effectively out for upcoming demand this period. Promised lead time is 0 and prior conclude messages consistently confirmed lead_time=0. I therefore keep L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use a recent_N approach with N=5 to capture the sustained higher regime observed since Period 9 (regime length = 5 recent periods); this raises the base stock to cover the new normal. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent observed volatility rather than older low-variance history. These choices push the backend to increase target inventory to avoid stockouts under the new higher demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Profit per unit=$4, holding=$1. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1\u201314) are all 0, so I use calculate to confirm L=0. Demand shows a sustained higher regime starting at Period 9 (Periods 9\u201314 demand sequence: 149,182,145,177,177,216 \u2014 6 periods). Because this is a sustained uplift, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (captures the current higher mean and volatility across the review+lead horizon). This keeps required inventory aligned to the new demand regime (improving service) while limiting overstock by using only the recent regime data rather than all older low-demand periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16: on-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple confirms P1\u2192P1, etc.). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 9 (Periods 9\u201315 show sustained higher demand vs Periods 1\u20138). With lead time = 0, we must cover current-period demand only when ordering. I choose L='default' to trust the promised lead time (and confirmed 0 in history). For demand sizing I use a recent_N approach using the most recent continuous high-demand regime (Periods 9\u201315, 7 samples) so mu_hat reflects current elevated demand rather than older low-demand data. I set sigma_hat with recent_N (same N=7) to capture recent volatility. This increases the base_stock to reduce lost sales during the sustained high-demand regime while the profit/holding tradeoff (profit $4 vs holding $1) still favors service; using recent data keeps safety stock appropriate without overstocking against older low-demand periods. Given on-hand=9 and no pipeline, these parameters will prompt the OR engine to order towards the elevated base stock to restore service level quickly.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 9 (historic samples P1\u2013P16 available). Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (recorded earlier). Given zero on-hand/pipeline and sustained higher recent demand (Periods 9\u201316 show elevated means around ~180\u2013200), I use a recent_N forecast to focus the OR engine on the current high-demand regime. L set to default to keep promised lead time=0 (confirmed by history). mu_hat set to recent_N with N=8 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 8 periods (Periods 9\u201316) capturing the sustained demand increase. sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility rather than diluting with low-demand earlier periods. These choices prioritize service (higher base-stock) while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap formula to limit excessive inventory given holding cost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 start: on-hand=6, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been high and sustained \u2014 last 5 period demands (P13\u2013P17) = [177,216,187,217,198], average \u2248199, showing the elevated regime observed earlier. Historical concluded lead times remain 0 in all observed periods, so I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). Because demand regime increased but is already reflected in recent orders/arrivals and the OR engine's default mu_hat/sigma_hat use all samples (providing stability), I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history. This balances service (captures long-run mean) against holding cost; if shortages or clear new sustained shifts appear in future periods, I'll switch to a recent_N or EWMA update. Current decision also accounts for no in-transit inventory and only 6 on-hand, so the backend's base-stock calculation (using profit/holding tradeoff) will drive the immediate replenishment quantity.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201318) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period), and current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we have no buffer heading into Period 19. Demand shows a sustained higher regime starting Period 9 (noted in carry-over): recent demand (Periods 9\u201318) is materially above pre-Period-9 levels. To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost, I select the promised/default lead time (0) because arrivals have repeatedly confirmed 0. For demand we target the recent higher regime by using the last 10 periods (Periods 9\u201318) to form mu_hat \u2014 this captures the sustained uplift while using a sufficiently large sample (N=10) to stabilize the mean. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the current regime volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend sets a base-stock sized to cover the (1+L)-period demand under the elevated regime (improving fill rates) while the recent-N volatility estimate prevents excessive safety stock that would raise holding cost.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show all observed orders arriving same period (lead_time=0) and a sustained demand regime increase beginning Period 9 (Periods 9\u201319 average demand materially higher than Periods 1\u20138). Given zero inventory and elevated recent demand (Periods 9\u201319 = 11 periods), I bias the demand forecast to the recent high-demand regime to avoid costly stockouts. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by concluded history, so I keep L='default' (use promised lead time). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=11 (the length of the current high-demand regime) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 11 samples. This raises the base-stock to match higher demand while the backend's service-level z (driven by profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 high q) ensures a relatively high safety stock; using recent data prevents underforecasting and excessive lost sales given current zero inventory.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 decision. Recent history (Periods 9\u201320) shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs Periods 1\u20138: demand has been elevated and more variable since Period 9. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no pending arrivals). Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201320) confirm actual lead time = 0, so I use the default promised lead time. To capture the elevated demand regime I set demand forecast using the recent regime data: mu_hat uses recent_N over the most recent 12 periods (Periods 9\u201320) so the base-stock reflects higher recent mean demand across the (1+L) review+lead period. Volatility has also increased in the recent regime, so sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=12 to reflect recent std deviation rather than diluting with older low-demand periods. These choices (L=default, mu_hat recent_N N=12, sigma_hat recent_N N=12) steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock appropriate for the sustained higher demand while letting the backend cap prevent excessive over-ordering; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand) against holding cost.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: demand context shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 9 (previously recorded). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must restock to cover this elevated demand immediately. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in conclude messages (orders arriving same period), so I keep L as default (promised = 0). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 9\u201321), I set demand forecasts using a recent-window over that regime: use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 9\u201321) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 13 samples. I apply the same recent_N window (N=13) for sigma_hat so variability reflects the current regime. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated, sustained demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent volatility; with L=0 the system can respond each period without needing extra pipeline coverage.

Period 23 decision. Recent demand has clearly increased and been sustained since Period 9 (carry-over already recorded). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201322) consistently show arrivals same period as order \u2192 actual lead time confirmed 0. Because the demand regime shifted up from Period 9 onward and that regime is sustained (Periods 9\u201322, length=14), I use a recent-window estimate to focus the forecast on the higher regime. Therefore: L set to default (promised lead time = 0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=14 to capture the elevated mean demand over the sustained higher-demand regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=14 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These settings give the OR backend a forecast that reflects the sustained higher demand and appropriate variability, improving service (profit capture) while avoiding excessive holding cost given lead time is zero and inventory is currently zero.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 for every past order (Period1\u201323 concluded arrivals). Demand has stepped up twice: an earlier shift around Period 9 (noted in carry-over) and a more recent, sustained high-demand regime from Period 19 onward (Periods 19\u201323 demands = 301, 296, 307, 283, 342). I therefore keep L = default to reflect the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost shipments. For demand forecasting I target the current high-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (last 5 periods, Periods 19\u201323) so the base-stock and safety buffer reflect the new higher mean and volatility. This raises target inventory to avoid stockouts while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap formula. The chosen approach balances service level (avoid frequent lost sales at current high demand) vs holding cost by relying on a short recent window (N=5) to capture the current regime rather than diluting with older, lower-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: avg demand (Periods 19\u201323) = 305.8 vs prior regime avg 163.25 (Periods 9\u201312), increase \u2248 +87.4%; sustainment: 5 periods (P19\u2013P23).

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 context: on-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders placed previously arrived same period through Period 24). Demand has clearly entered a higher regime since Period 19 (recent periods show demands ~300+). With only 17 units on-hand and no pipeline, we are effectively stockless versus expected recent demand (~300/unit periods). To get the OR backend to target the recent high-demand regime, I set L to the default promised lead time (0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 19\u201324, regime length=6) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 6 samples and plans base stock accordingly. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the recent volatility rather than older lower-variance data. These choices bias ordering toward meeting the elevated service-level implied by recent demand while keeping variance estimation focused on the most relevant regime. This addresses missing pipeline by forcing the OR engine to replenish to a base stock that reflects the current high-demand environment.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 start. Recent history (Periods 19\u201325) shows a sustained, higher-demand regime (~300+ units) relative to earlier periods; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet upcoming high demand. All concluded arrival messages (Periods 1\u201325) show orders arriving in the same period they were ordered, so actual lead time is 0. I select L using 'calculate' so backend confirms lead time from observed concludes (expected = 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 19\u201325) because a changepoint was detected at Period 19 and the high-demand regime has persisted for 7 periods; using the last 7 samples gives the backend a forecast anchored to the current high regime. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7 so variability reflects the recent high-demand regime volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand period while keeping holding cost awareness via the backend's service-level tradeoff.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning at Period 19 (Periods 19\u201326 all well above earlier levels). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must replenish to meet immediate period demand plus lead/review coverage. Observed concluded lead times across history are consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so I use the calculated/observed lead time. For demand I focus on the most recent confirmed regime (Period 19 onward) because it is sustained (8 periods so far) and materially higher than prior regimes; this avoids under-ordering from older low-demand data. Per the changepoint rules, I set N=8 (regime length) for recent_N methods. Thus: L chosen as "calculate" to reflect observed lead times = 0; mu_hat set via recent_N with N=8 to target (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 8 demand observations (captures the new higher mean); sigma_hat set via recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility. This combination tells the OR backend to size base stock for the elevated demand regime while using recent variability to set safety stock\u2014balancing the $4 profit per unit (favoring service) against $1 holding cost (penalizing excess inventory). Given on-hand and in-transit are zero, these parameters will produce an order to restore stock to the regime-appropriate base stock and reduce lost sales in the current high-demand regime.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent history shows demand has stepped up in two sustained regimes (noted in carry-over): a jump around Period 9 and a larger, sustained jump beginning ~Period 19. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we are fully exposed to stockouts this period. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201327) report lead_time=0 for orders (orders placed in Period X arrived same Period X), so I set L using observed data (calculate) which yields L\u22480. For demand forecast I concentrate on the most recent regime (Periods 19\u201327) because demand from that regime is substantially higher and sustained; I choose recent_N with N=9 (Periods 19\u201327) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 9 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 9 samples). This focuses the OR backend on the high-demand regime, improving service level while the cap still limits order size. Using recent_N for both mean and volatility helps balance profit vs holding costs in the current high-demand environment and avoids diluting the forecast with much lower earlier-period demand.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistently that actual lead time = 0 (every period's ordered units arrived same period). Demand has moved through two sustained up regimes captured in carry-over: a jump at Period 9 and a larger jump at Period 19; the most recent high-demand regime spans Periods 19\u201328 (10 periods) with demands in the ~300\u2013400 range. No overdue or lost shipments are visible. Therefore: keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm 0 lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples reflecting current elevated demand); set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility rather than older low-demand variance. These choices align the OR backend base-stock target to the current sustained demand level while limiting excess inventory from older low-demand periods.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, profit=$4/unit, holding=$1/unit. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders always arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 19 (see history). Given zero observed pipeline and immediate same-period arrivals historically, we must replenish to cover current high-regime demand. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=11) to capture the sustained high-demand regime from Period 19\u201329; this keeps the base-stock responsive to the new higher mean rather than diluting with older low-demand data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=11 to reflect volatility in the current regime. These choices ensure the OR backend computes a base-stock that targets a high service level (q = profit/(profit+holding)=0.8 \u2192 z\u22480.84) appropriate for high lost-sales cost, while using recent demand stats to avoid overstocking from older low-demand periods. I explicitly note that with on-hand and in-transit at zero, the OR engine will likely place substantial same-period orders to meet the elevated mean demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19 confirmed and sustained through Period 29: avg demand (Periods 19\u201329) = 336.64 vs prior regime avg 163.25 (Periods 9\u201312), increase \u2248 +106.2%; sustainment: 11 periods (P19\u2013P29).

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 decision. All observed conclude messages (Periods 1\u201330) show actual lead time = 0 consistently, and current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand regime shift that began at Period 19 produced a much higher demand level (Periods 19\u201329 avg \u2248 336.6) and Period 30 saw an extreme spike to 450 (single-period). Because the elevated regime (starting Period 19) is sustained through Period 29 and continues into Period 30, I bias the forecast toward the most recent regime rather than the long-run mean. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) since observed lead times are consistently 0. For demand I use a recent_N approach with N=12 (Periods 19\u201330) to capture the current high-demand regime while dampening the single-period spike at P30. I apply the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices give the OR backend a (1+L)-period demand estimate centered on the currently sustained high-demand regime, increasing service level to avoid stockouts while the capped ordering limits will control extreme orders and holding costs.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 19 and continuing through Period 31 (elevated demands ~300\u2013450). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must plan for the current high-demand regime and the current promised lead time. All concluded arrivals (P1\u2013P31) show lead_time=0 consistently, so use the default promised lead time. For demand forecasting I use a recent_N estimate to capture the sustained higher-demand regime: I select N=13 (Periods 19\u201331 inclusive) which captures the full recent regime length and is between the min/max bounds. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend sets base stock and cap reflecting the current elevated mean and volatility, improving service (reduce stockouts) while letting the backend's cap limit excessive orders to control holding costs.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 decision. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 19 and has persisted through Period 32 (14 periods). All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period throughout the history). On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so pipeline_inventory is zero entering the decision. Given sustained elevated demand (Periods 19\u201332) I set lead time to the promised/default (0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0; I set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent regime (to capture the new higher mean and variability). I choose recent_N with N=14 (Periods 19\u201332) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 14 samples, which aligns the base-stock target to current realized demand while keeping safety stock sized to the observed volatility. This balances higher service level (profit/$4 vs holding $1) against holding costs by using actual recent demand rather than long-run lower mean estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1704.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34: recent demand has jumped further. Historical conclusions: lead time has consistently been 0 (every concluded period shows arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover current period demand as arrival is same-period. Demand evidence: Periods 30\u201333 demands = [450, 444, 528, 534], a clear new high regime above prior P19\u2013P29 average (~336.64). I therefore (1) keep L = default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently confirms 0; (2) set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new elevated regime (N=4 chosen because the new regime duration is 4 periods so far, and N must be between 3 and available samples); this biases the base-stock toward the recently observed higher mean and volatility, which the OR backend will translate into a larger base stock to avoid stockouts while the holding cost tradeoff is handled by the backend's q calculation. With on-hand=0 and no pipeline, these parameters will prompt the OR engine to order aggressively to meet the now-higher demand while still balancing profit vs holding cost via the backend formula.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand (Periods 30\u201333)=489 vs prior regime avg 336.64 (Periods 19\u201329), increase \u2248 +45.4%; sustainment: 4 periods (P30\u2013P33).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 start. Recent history shows confirmed zero actual lead time (all concluded arrivals indicate lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so any order placed now arrives during Period 35 (lead_time=0) and will be available for demand in the same period. Demand has shifted upward: Periods 30\u201334 demands = [450, 444, 528, 534, 543], mean=499.8, clearly above prior regime (Periods 19\u201329 avg \u2248336.64). Because this higher-demand regime is sustained for 5 consecutive periods, I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new mean and volatility. L: keep default (promised lead time=0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. mu_hat: use recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the last 5 periods (captures the post-Period-30 regime mean \u2248499.8). sigma_hat: use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility around the new regime. Rationale vs costs: profit=$4, holding=$1 gives q=4/(4+1)=0.8 \u2192 high service level (z* large). Using recent data prevents the backend from under-forecasting given the clear sustained demand increase while sigma estimated on the same recent window lets the OR engine size safety stock appropriately. Because on-hand and in-transit are zero, this parameterization will prompt the OR engine to replenish up to a base-stock tuned to the recent high-demand regime, balancing lost-sales cost (profit foregone) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 confirmed and sustained through Period 34: avg demand (Periods 30\u201334)=499.8 vs prior regime avg 336.64 (Periods 19\u201329), increase \u2248 +48.7%; sustainment: 5 periods (P30\u2013P34).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Context: On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (every concluded period since P1 shows arrived same period), so promised lead time=0 remains valid. Demand has been through multiple upward regime shifts earlier; most recent stable high-demand regime began at Period 30 and has persisted through Period 35. Recent demands (P30\u2013P35) = [450, 444, 528, 534, 543, 519], average = 503 units/period. With lead time L=0, the review+lead period length is 1, so mu_hat should reflect the high recent mean rather than the long-run average. I choose recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 (the length of the current high-demand regime observed P30\u2013P35) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples = 1\xd7503 \u2248 503. For sigma_hat I also choose recent_N with N=6 to capture volatility in the current regime. Using recent samples reduces stockouts during this sustained high-demand phase while avoiding excessive hold costs from older, lower-demand data. Because on-hand is only 22 and in-transit is 0, this parameterization will push the OR engine to order toward a base stock aligned with the current high-demand regime and improve service while keeping holding cost tradeoffs explicit to the optimizer.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2164.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 start. Recent demand is firmly in the high regime that began at Period 30: recent demands (P30\u2013P36) = [450,444,528,534,543,519,567], mean \u2248 512 units/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand after ordering. Historical concludes consistently show orders arriving same period (observed lead_time=0 across many periods), so use promised/default lead time. To capture the elevated, sustained demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=7 periods, P30\u2013P36). This biases the OR engine toward a higher base stock to avoid lost sales while keeping safety stock sized to recent volatility. L: default preserves confirmed same-period arrivals; mu_hat: recent_N (N=7) uses the current high-demand average across review+lead; sigma_hat: recent_N (N=7) captures recent demand variability for appropriate safety stock sizing.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38: recent demand is a sustained high regime since Period 30 (periods 30\u201337 demands = 450,444,528,534,543,519,567,626). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current period demand plus safety. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period consistently), so use promised/default lead time. To capture the elevated mean and volatility of the current regime, I use recent_N on the last 8 demand samples (Periods 30\u201337) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This focuses the OR backend on the latest high-demand regime so base_stock scales up (higher \u03bc\u0302) while sigm\xe2 reflects recent variability, balancing service level (profit-driven) versus holding cost given holding cost is relatively low ($1) vs profit $4.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period for all concluded periods), so promised lead time remains valid. Demand has clearly shifted into a higher regime starting around Period 30 and sustained through the most recent periods (Periods 30\u201338 demand: 450,444,528,534,543,519,567,626,637 \u2014 sustained high demand). To have the OR engine target service during this sustained high-demand regime, I use recent_N (the most recent regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the elevated mean and volatility. I choose N=9 to cover Periods 30\u201338 (regime length = 9), which meets the recommended rule (N between 3 and 20 and equal to the recent regime length). L uses default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms lead time = 0. These choices bias ordering toward meeting high recent demand while allowing the backend's cap to moderate order sizes given its internal cap calculation.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Recent demand is in a sustained high regime since Period 30: Periods 30\u201339 demands = [450,444,528,534,543,519,567,626,637,679] (10 periods) showing a clear elevated mean and rising trend. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must protect service immediately. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0 (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0), so use the promised/default lead time to keep OR backend aligned. For demand sizing I use a recent_N forecast over the last 10 periods (N=10) to capture the new high-demand regime; mu_hat = recent_N will scale (1+L)\xd7mean of those 10 samples. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=10 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize meeting very high current demand (reduce stockouts) while keeping safety stock grounded in recent variance to limit excessive holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4 (service-favoring but not unlimited).

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals through Period 40 show actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order arrived same period). Demand has been in a high regime since Period 30 with especially strong recent demand (Periods 36\u201340: 567, 626, 637, 679, 694). To ensure the OR engine targets the current high-demand regime and captures recent volatility, I set L using calculate (confirming observed lead time=0) and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the last five periods. This biases orders upward to avoid stockouts in the sustained high-demand regime while letting the backend cap orders per its policy to limit excess holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2732.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 decision. Recent demand has been rising sharply and persistently; the last observed demand (Period 41) = 734. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0 so there are no arrivals expected this period and no overdue shipments to reconcile. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (every concluded arrival shows lead_time = 0), so I rely on observed lead-time history. Demand regime since Period 30 is the current high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201341 inclusive = 12 periods) \u2014 I therefore base the forecast on the most recent 12 samples to capture the current elevated mean and volatility. Choices: L: "calculate" to let backend compute average observed lead time (will reflect the sustained 0 observed). mu_hat: "recent_N" with N=12 to use (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 12 demand samples so the base-stock targets the current high-demand regime and reduces stockouts. sigma_hat: "recent_N" with N=12 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These settings help the OR backend increase target inventory to meet the sustained higher demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock; using recent_N avoids diluting the signal with older, lower-demand periods. Holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) implies a relatively high service level target; using the recent regime keeps service high while avoiding excessive carry from older periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (orders placed each period arrived same period through Period_42), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand has stepped up multiple times; most recently from Period_36 onward demand has been persistently higher (Periods 36\u201342: 567,626,637,679,694,734,719). I set L to default (promised lead time 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the new higher demand regime starting Period_36 \u2014 N chosen equal to detected regime length (7 periods) per the changepoint rules. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat makes the OR engine base-stock and cap respond to the sustained increase in mean and volatility observed since Period_36, improving service (reducing stockouts) while avoiding carrying unnecessary inventory from older lower-demand periods. This balances the profit-driven higher service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding costs by focusing estimates on the current high-demand regime rather than the full historical series.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: avg demand (Periods 36\u201342)=665.14 vs prior regime avg 499.8 (Periods 30\u201334), increase \u2248 +33.1%; sustainment: 7 periods (P36\u2013P42).

Period 44 start. Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 36. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals visible). Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect that confirmed behavior. For demand I target the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 36\u201343) where average demand \u2248 680.9 units/period (sum 5,447 over 8 periods -> 680.875). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 captures the current elevated mean and recent volatility while avoiding stale earlier low-demand periods. This will raise the base-stock to meet the much higher short-term demand and reduce lost-sales, while sigma_hat recent_N ensures the OR engine accounts for current variability. Profit=$4 and holding=$1 imply a high service target (q=0.8), so prioritizing recent high mean is appropriate given zero on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P44) consistently show orders arriving in the same period they were placed (observed lead_time = 0 every concluded period), so promised lead time = 0 is confirmed. Demand has moved through multiple upward regime shifts and the most recent high-demand regime has persisted from Period 36\u219244 (9 periods of elevated demand). To capture the current elevated demand level and its volatility, I use a recent_N window covering the most recent 9 concluded periods (Periods 36\u201344). This gives mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 9 samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 9 samples, allowing the OR backend to target a higher base stock consistent with current demand while the capped order cap will limit extreme orders. Using recent data helps balance service (avoid lost sales in this sustained high-demand regime) against holding cost (we keep window limited to confirmed regime length rather than using the much larger historical mean).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46 start. All observed conclude messages (Periods 1\u201345) show actual lead time = 0 (orders always arrived same period), so I'll use the default promised lead time. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we have no coverage for immediate demand; orders must arrive same period to help this period. Historical demand shows a sustained, higher-demand regime starting around Period 36 and continuing through Periods 36\u201345 (recent demands large and rising). To size the (review+lead) demand forecast I focus on the most recent stable high-demand regime: use a recent_N forecast to capture the elevated mean and recent volatility while avoiding outdated lower-demand periods. I select N=10 (Periods 36\u201345 is a sustained high-demand regime of length 10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets base-stock to serve the high recent demand while capping orders via its cap logic. This balances service (high profit $4 > holding $1 favors higher fill) versus holding cost by relying on recent data rather than the long-run average. Because there are no in-transit units and lead time is 0, the backend can place same-period replenishment to immediately meet demand.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 decision. All concluded history (Periods 1\u201346) shows actual lead time = 0 each time (every conclude includes arrived=(ordered on same period, lead_time was 0)). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for this period's demand plus maintain service given very large recent demand. Demand has undergone multiple sustained upward regime shifts (noted in carry-over): the most recent high-demand regime began at Period 36 and has persisted through Period 46. I therefore: (1) use L='default' to trust the promised lead time = 0 because concluded history consistently confirms lead_time=0; (2) set mu_hat using recent_N on the latest sustained high-demand regime to capture the current elevated mean demand and avoid under-ordering \u2014 I choose N=11 (Periods 36\u201346 inclusive is 11 periods, a sustained regime since the last documented changepoint); (3) set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=11 to reflect the recent volatility in the high-demand regime. Using recent_N for both mean and volatility ensures the OR backend's base-stock and cap calculations are driven by the most relevant, sustained demand pattern, balancing high service probability (profit $4 vs holding $1 encourages higher fill) against holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201347) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders ordered in Period X arrived in Period X), so promised lead time remains valid. Demand has experienced several upward regime shifts and the most recent sustained regime started at Period 36 and continues through Period 47 (12 periods) with substantially higher demand. With no pipeline and zero on-hand, we must size the review+lead demand forecast to the current high-demand regime. Therefore: L="default" to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded lead-time observations are consistently 0; mu_hat="recent_N" with N=12 to capture the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 36\u201347); sigma_hat="recent_N" with N=12 to reflect recent volatility. This choice keeps the base-stock targeted to the current regime mean (improving service in the face of much higher demand) while using recent volatility to avoid extreme safety stock that would inflate holding cost. It also addresses the immediate situation (zero on-hand/pipeline) by aligning replenishment to the confirmed high-demand period rather than older, lower-demand history.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. Recent demands have been in a high, sustained regime (Periods 44\u201348 demands = 873, 907, 968, 957, 1043). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet immediate period demand. All concluded messages consistently show orders arriving same period (lead_time observed = 0 every concluded period), so use the promised/default lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime while limiting excess holding cost, I set demand estimates from the most recent 5 periods (captures the latest trend while smoothing short noise). This yields mu_hat based on recent mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5) and sigma_hat based on recent std (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 5). These parameters increase the base-stock to meet the elevated demand but keep the cap constraint active to prevent extreme overstocking given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 in every concluded period, so using promised/default lead time (L=0) is consistent with evidence. Demand has undergone multiple sustained upward regime shifts (recorded in carry-over history). Recent realized demand (Periods 43\u201349) remains much higher than earlier regimes, so I focus forecasting on the most recent regime rather than the long-run mean. Therefore: L set to default (promised 0). mu_hat set using recent_N with N=7 to capture the last 7 periods' elevated demand pattern and produce (1+L)\xd7mean over that recent window. sigma_hat set using recent_N with N=7 to capture recent volatility. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock responsive to the current high-demand regime while avoiding blending with older, much lower-demand periods; using recent_N for sigma ensures safety stock reflects recent variability to balance the 80% service quantile (profit/(profit+holding)=4/5) against holding cost.
