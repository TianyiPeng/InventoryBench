Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrival history to infer lead time changes. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show mean demand = 115.6 units/period and sample standard deviation \u2248 26.6. Promised lead time applies and there is no evidence of a changepoint or seasonal event in the provided data. I choose default methods so the OR backend uses promised L and the full-sample demand moments: L=default to respect the promised lead time (no concluded arrivals to contradict it); mu_hat=default to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on all samples (conservative, uses all available information); sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (using historical mean) against holding cost given no signals of demand or lead-time shifts. On-hand + in-transit = 0, so orders will be driven entirely by the backend's base-stock calculation using these inputs.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. Context: On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Last conclude (Period 1) shows the Period 1 order (141) arrived in Period 1 (lead_time=0) and demand in that period was 118 (ending inventory 23). Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [103, 81, 107, 127, 160], mean = 115.6. Promised lead time = 0 and observed lead time so far = 0. Given a high profit-to-(profit+holding) ratio (q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8) the OR will favor a high service level; to support that without overreacting to a single period, I use the observed lead time average and let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample set (default). This provides (1+L)*mean demand and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples, which balances service level and holding cost while respecting confirmed 0-period lead time and current on-hand stock. No shipments are overdue and there is no sustained demand regime change warranting a recent_N or explicit forecast.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 1)

Daily Reward (R_t): $301.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Observed concluded lead times for Periods 1\u20132 are 0 (consistent with promised L=0). Current on-hand=51, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments visible. Demand history shows a recent upward shift: five-sample series = [103, 81, 107, 127, 160]; the mean of the last 3 samples = 131.3 vs overall mean \u2248115.6 (+14%), indicating a modest recent increase in demand. To capture this recent regime shift while relying on confirmed lead-time behavior, I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to weight the higher recent demand and its volatility. This increases the base-stock target to reduce stockouts given rising demand while keeping holding cost in mind (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies moderate service-level target).

Daily Reward (R_t): $387.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Observed concluded history shows actual lead times = 0 for all observed orders (Periods 1-3), on-hand = 45, in-transit = 0. Demand history (recent samples) shows an upward shift (103,81,107,127,160) with the last three periods noticeably higher; to capture the recent higher demand while keeping safety stock reasonable given high profit vs holding (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 high service target), I set L based on observed lead times and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest regime. This gives the OR engine a demand forecast focused on the most recent higher-demand regime while relying on confirmed lead time = 0 so orders are expected to arrive same-period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $257.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (Periods 1\u20134 arrivals all state lead_time=0) and on-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples: [103, 81, 107, 127, 160] (mean=115.6). Promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times confirm same-period arrivals. I select L using 'calculate' to let the backend compute the average observed lead time (will be 0 based on concluded history). For demand and volatility I use the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this leverages the full sample set (no strong evidence of a sustained regime change in demand yet) and keeps ordering aligned with observed lead time, balancing the high unit profit ($4) against holding cost ($1). This avoids overreacting to the single high demand in Period_5 while keeping service levels reasonable given confirmed zero lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $345.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: on-hand=35, in-transit=0, profit=$4, holding=$1. Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 each concluded period) and five recent observed demands: [118, 88, 108, 75, 95] (mean=96.8). Pipeline is empty so coverage must come from on-hand + new order. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0 actual lead time across periods 1\u20135. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent regime (no sustained multi-period structural shift detected but recent variability argues for using the latest sample set); backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 5) = 1\xd796.8 \u224896.8. For volatility I use default so the backend computes sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These choices keep the base-stock tuned to very recent demand while trusting confirmed short lead time, helping the OR engine balance service level (by using recent demand mean) versus holding cost (by not inflating demand estimate with older outliers). Given on-hand=35 and mu_hat\u224896.8, the OR engine will order to rebuild stock to cover the (L+1)-period demand while capping order size by its cap parameter.

Daily Reward (R_t): $472.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent concluded history (Periods 1-6) shows every order arrived in the same period it was placed (lead_time=0 for all concluded orders). Demand history across concluded periods: 118, 88, 108, 75, 95, 122. Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1 gives a high service target (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8). I set L using calculate to reflect the observed lead-time evidence (average of concluded lead times = 0). For demand I used the default methods (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat). Rationale: no sustained regime shift (need 3+ periods of a new level) \u2014 last-period spike to 122 is not yet a sustained change. Using all-sample defaults smooths noise while the high profit/low holding cost implies aiming for higher service levels; the OR backend will combine mu_hat/sigma_hat with the profit/holding ratio to set base-stock. Also flag that on-hand+pipeline=0 so the backend should replenish to meet target service level immediately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $512.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand history (Periods 1-7) shows a clear upward push in the last two periods (122, 167), suggesting demand has increased versus earlier periods. No concluded arrivals are outstanding and all prior orders have arrived with observed lead_time=0, so shipment reliability is good. I choose to use a calculated lead time based on observed data (calculate \u2192 average observed lead times = 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand level (mu_hat) I use an EWMA with gamma=0.5 to weight recent high demands more heavily while still retaining longer-run information \u2014 this helps the OR backend increase the base-stock to reduce stockouts given zero on-hand/in-transit. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture current volatility around the recent higher-demand regime (using the last 5 demand samples balances recency and sample size). These choices aim to raise target stock to avoid lost sales from the recent demand uptick while keeping variance estimates grounded so the backend's cap prevents excessive ordering and holding costs.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times for Periods 1\u20138 are consistently 0, so I trust a 0-period lead time. Demand has shifted up starting Period_6: Periods 1\u20135 mean demand \u224896.8, while Periods 6\u20138 mean demand \u2248167.7 (sustained for 3 periods). With no pipeline inventory and a confirmed higher-demand regime, I set L based on observed lead times and use a recent_N forecast (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new regime (Periods 6\u20138). This raises the backend base_stock to cover the higher short-term demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility; this reduces expected stockouts at the cost of some additional holding, which is acceptable given profit ($4) >> holding ($1) and the recent large demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg increased from 96.8 (Periods 1\u20135) to 167.7 (Periods 6\u20138) (+73%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $788.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. Recent history shows a clear, sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 6: recent demands (P6\u2013P9) are much higher than P1\u2013P5. On-hand = 8, in-transit = 0, and no overdue/lost shipments are observed (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). Promised lead time is 0 and historically confirmed. To capture the higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding cost, I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, anchored to the most recent high-demand regime. I select N=4 (Periods 6\u20139) because the changepoint regime length is 4 periods; this focuses the base-stock on the new higher-demand level. Keeping L=default (promised 0) leverages confirmed same-period arrivals. Using recent estimates increases service level during the sustained high-demand regime while sigma estimated over the same window prevents underestimating variability and controls excess inventory given the $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $415.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 context: confirmed same-period arrivals historically (lead time observed = 0). Recent demand regime (Periods 6\u201310) is higher than early periods: recent demands = [122, 167, 214, 199, 125], recent mean = 165.4. On-hand = 85, in-transit = 0, so we currently have moderate cover but demand is elevated; no overdue shipments observed. Decision: keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 periods. For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach with N=5 to capture the new, higher demand regime (Periods 6\u201310) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to raise the base stock to match elevated demand. For variability I also use recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine sees the recent volatility and sets safety stock accordingly. This balances service (avoiding stockouts under the new regime) against holding cost by basing calculations only on the sustained higher-demand recent window rather than diluting with the lower earlier periods.

Daily Profit: $756.00, Daily Holding Cost: $12.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $744.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 start. Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 0 in all concluded periods (P1\u2013P11). Demand rose starting Period_6 and has stayed at a higher level through Period_11 (P6\u2013P11 demands = 122,167,214,199,125,189). Current on-hand = 12, in-transit = 0, so we are effectively starting low against elevated demand and should plan against the higher regime. Profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high target fill rate (q\u22480.8); to avoid stockouts given this sustained higher-demand regime I set L to default (promised = 0) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the last 6 periods (Periods 6\u201311) which represent the new regime. N=6 (regime length=6) is \u22653 and captures the sustained shift. This raises the forecasted (1+L)-period mean and retains realized volatility from the recent regime so the OR backend will compute a larger base stock (higher \u03bc\u0302 and appropriate \u03c3\u0302), prioritizing sales and profit while accepting moderate holding cost given the high profit margin.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 6. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so I keep the backend's promised lead time. For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6\u201312) because demand averages and volatility are materially higher than Periods 1\u20135; I choose recent_N with N=7 (Periods 6\u201312) so the backend's mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new regime. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts during the sustained higher-demand period while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock to balance service level vs holding cost. No overdue shipments are visible (no missing arrives in concluded messages).

Daily Reward (R_t): $836.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period_6. Recent realized demands (Periods 6\u201313) = [122, 167, 214, 199, 125, 189, 213, 215], mean = 180.5 units/period. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0 so we must replenish to meet the elevated demand immediately. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so I retain the promised lead time. I select L = default to use the promised 0-period lead time. For demand sizing I use a recent_N approach over the most recent regime (Periods 6\u201313) where the higher demand is sustained; regime length = 8 so N=8. Thus mu_hat uses recent_N N=8 which yields (1+L)\xd7recent_mean = 1\xd7180.5. For uncertainty I use sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to capture current volatility from the same recent samples. These choices raise the base-stock and safety stock to meet the higher service needs observed since Period_6 while keeping holding cost awareness via the OR backend tradeoff (profit $4 vs holding $1). This approach responds to the confirmed regime shift and the current zero on-hand/pipeline to reduce stockouts while not overcommitting to older low-demand periods.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 decision: on-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (Periods 1\u201314). Demand has a sustained higher regime starting at Period_6 (higher mean since Period_6 vs Periods 1\u20135). I therefore use the promised/default lead time behavior (L=default) because concluded history confirms lead time = 0. For forecasting I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6\u201314) where demand is persistently higher: I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over that recent regime to capture the elevated mean and variability so the OR backend will target a higher base-stock (improving service during the higher-demand regime) while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to reduce stockouts. This approach keeps holding cost in check by not carrying safety stock based on older, lower-demand samples and trusts concluded lead-time evidence so orders should arrive same period as placed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $576.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 context: on-hand=56, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201315) consistently show arrivals same-period (lead_time=0), so actual lead time remains 0. Demand regime evidence: earlier periods 1\u20135 averaged ~96.8, then from Period 6 onward demand stepped up substantially (previous carry-over: +73%). Recent realized demands (Periods 11\u201315 = 189, 213, 215, 202, 158) average \u2248195.4, indicating the new higher-demand regime persists. Pipeline is empty and current on-hand (56) is far below one-period demand under the new regime, so we must target the higher recent mean to avoid stockouts. I therefore set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (0), and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base stock and safety stock based on the most recent high-demand regime (backend will apply the (1+L) multiplier). This balances service (avoid lost sales under the sustained higher demand) against holding cost by focusing on recent demand and observed low lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=21, in-transit=0, no overdue or missing arrivals (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). Demand has sustained at a higher regime since Period 6; the most recent 11-period mean (Periods 6\u201316) is \u2248182 units/period vs. pre-shift \u224897. Profit/holding ratio implies a high service target (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8). To ensure service while avoiding excessive holding cost, I use the confirmed promised lead time (default L=0) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent regime (recent_N with N=11) so the OR engine targets stock appropriate for the sustained higher demand. This balances higher fill-rate (to capture profit) against holding costs by letting the backend compute safety stock from recent mean/variance rather than diluting with older low-demand data.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 0 (every concluded order arrived same period). On-hand=16, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low relative to recent demand. Historical demand samples show a clear, sustained regime shift upward starting Period_6 (higher mean from Period_6 onward). Profit=$4, holding=$1 implies a high service-level target (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8) so the OR engine will target safety stock; to reflect the new higher-demand regime I use recent observations only. L: use default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=12 to base the (1+L)*mean on the last 12 periods (Periods 6\u201317) which capture the sustained higher-demand regime and give a stable mean estimate while respecting the changepoint. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=12 to estimate variability from the same recent regime. This combination raises the base stock to match elevated demand while keeping volatility and lead-time assumptions aligned with observed behavior, balancing lost-sales risk (high profit) against holding cost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand history (Periods 1\u201318) shows a sustained regime increase beginning at Period 6: later periods (6\u201318) have higher mean and volatility than Periods 1\u20135. With no pipeline inventory and recent high demand (including a 250 spike in Period 18), I choose parameters that focus the forecast on the post-change regime to avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost. L: use default (promised lead time 0) because all concluded lead-time observations are 0. mu_hat: use recent_N over the post-change regime to capture the higher recent mean demand; I choose N=13 (Periods 6\u201318) since the changepoint at Period 6 yields a 13-period recent regime. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=13 to reflect the recent higher variability and ensure the backend increases safety stock appropriately. This configuration raises target base-stock to cover the elevated recent demand and variance, reducing lost sales risk given zero on-hand and zero in-transit.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 (confirmed earlier), so I keep promised lead time (default=0). Demand clearly shifted up starting at Period 6 (Periods 1\u20135 mean \u224896.8; Periods 6\u201319 higher). To reflect the sustained higher regime, I use a recent_N estimate covering the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6\u201319) so the OR backend bases base_stock on current elevated demand. Recent_N (N=14) uses the last 14 concluded demand samples to capture the new mean and volatility while smoothing older low-demand data. This increases target base stock to protect service level given frequent stockouts in the new regime, while sigma_hat recent_N ensures safety-stock scales to observed recent variability. No shipments are currently in-transit, so orders placed now must cover current period demand plus the review horizon; choosing recent regime-based forecasts prevents chronic underordering and balances profit vs holding cost by reflecting true demand drivers.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so I will use the promised lead time. Demand exhibits a sustained higher-regime starting at Period 6 (noted previously); recent periods (P6\u2013P20) are the relevant regime for forecasting. To capture the elevated mean and variability while avoiding dilution by the low pre-change samples, I use recent_N = 15 (Periods 6\u201320) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N focuses the base-stock (mu_hat) on the higher demand regime and uses its volatility for sigma_hat, which raises the safety stock appropriately to keep service high given the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1). Keeping L=default (promised 0) aligns with observed lead times and prevents artificially inflating pipeline coverage.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_22. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) across many periods and a sustained higher-demand regime that began at Period_6 and continues through Period_21. Recent demand has been elevated and more volatile compared with Periods 1\u20135, so I place weight on the recent regime for forecasting. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm the observed lead time (historical concluded arrivals indicate 0). For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N over the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 6\u201321, regime length=16) so the OR backend targets a base-stock sized for the current higher-demand environment. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat increases service level during this sustained higher-demand regime while avoiding excessive stock from older low-demand data.

Period 23 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (confirmed previously). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (sustained elevated demand through Period 22). Given zero pipeline and zero on-hand, we need the OR backend to plan against the elevated-demand regime. I set L to default so the backend uses the promised lead time (0), which is supported by concluded arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I chose recent_N with N=17 to capture the recent regime (Periods 6\u201322 inclusive is 17 samples) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most relevant data. This emphasizes service (higher mean) while sigma reflects recent volatility, letting the OR base-stock and cap balance profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1). With no on-hand or in-transit, this avoids under-ordering into the confirmed higher-demand regime.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 decision with on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data (Periods 1\u201323) show consistent actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order arrived same period). A demand regime shift occurred at Period 6 (earlier insight): demand rose and has remained elevated through Period 23. To capture the post-changepoint regime, I use recent_N over the post-change samples (Periods 6\u201323) so the OR backend forecasts mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most relevant data. L uses the default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently confirms 0 lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose recent_N with N=18 (regime length Periods 6\u201323 = 18); this focuses the forecast on the higher-demand regime and gives the OR engine an (1+L)-adjusted mean and volatility that balance service level needs versus holding cost under the confirmed low lead time.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 6 (sustained higher volumes through Period 24). To reflect the sustained regime and prioritize service (profit $4 vs holding $1), I use the recent demand regime for forecasting so the OR engine sets base-stock to cover the elevated demand. L: keep default (promised lead time=0) because arrivals have consistently concluded with 0 lead time. mu_hat: use recent_N over the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 6\u201324). Per the changepoint rules, regime_length=19 so N=19. This gives (1+L)\xd7mean of last 19 samples, capturing the higher demand level. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=19 to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the OR engine to maintain higher on-hand to avoid lost sales while still using the backend's capped order logic to limit extreme overstock given holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1096.00

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Recent history shows a sustained higher demand regime starting at Period 6 that persisted through Period 25 (multiple periods with frequent stockouts and much larger demands vs. Periods 1\u20135). Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must plan for immediate fulfillment of the elevated demand. All concluded messages show actual lead time = 0, so use promised/default lead time. For demand forecasting I use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 6\u201325, length = 20) so the backend's (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the higher sustained demand; N=20 is chosen per the instruction N = max(min(regime_length,20),3). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to capture the current volatility in the high-demand regime. These choices bias the base-stock higher to reduce lost sales under the confirmed higher-demand regime while the sigma estimate ensures safety stock to balance holding cost vs. service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1128.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show promised lead time 0 has held consistently through Period_26 (orders placed each period arrived same period). Recent demand has trended sharply higher: last 7-period average ~317 units (Periods 20\u201326) vs ~190 units earlier (Periods 6\u201319). With profit=$4 and holding=$1, service level should be elevated to avoid lost sales given current zero inventory. I therefore keep L at the default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the OR backend on near-term realized demand (captures the latest elevated demand while not overreacting to single spikes). I also set sigma_hat as recent_N, N=5 so safety stock reflects the recent volatility. These choices raise base-stock and the OR capped order appropriately to prioritize sales (profit>holding) while limiting excess stock buildup.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: avg increased from 190 (Periods 6\u201319) to 317 (Periods 20\u201326) (+66%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1372.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime from Periods 20\u201327 (previously recorded). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet current high demand. Lead times observed in concluded messages have consistently been 0 (many periods with arrived=ordered same period), so I let the backend compute an empirical lead time (calculate). Demand regime: Periods 20\u201327 form the current regime (8 periods). I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=8 (regime_length=8 \u2192 N=8) so the OR engine bases base_stock on the current high-demand mean and volatility. This raises the base stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period demand while keeping holding cost in mind (profit $4 vs holding $1 favors service). The chosen settings help the OR backend balance higher service levels for this sustained high-demand regime while the sigma estimate reflects recent variability so safety stock is appropriate.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet current high-demand regime. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 0 (confirmed in early conclude messages and every period's arrivals), so I use the promised/default lead time. Demand has clearly been in the higher regime since Period_20 (carry-over insight: regime shift at Period_20 to avg ~317 for P20\u201326). To capture the current elevated demand I use a recent_N estimate based on the most recent regime (Periods 20\u201328). Regime length = 9 periods (P20\u2013P28), so N=9 (follows N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR engine's base-stock around the current high mean and measured volatility. This aligns with the high service-level implied by profit/(profit+holding)=4/(4+1)=0.8 (z* near high percentile) while keeping sigma updated to avoid under-ordering during large spikes. Given no overdue or in-transit inventory and confirmed short lead time, these parameters will prompt the backend to order enough to cover (1+L) periods of this elevated demand while limiting excessive holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1456.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 decision. Recent history shows consistently zero observed lead time (every concluded arrival reports lead_time=0), and current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Demand has stepped up: earlier carry-overs noted a regime shift at Period 20 (avg \u2248317 for P20\u201326), and the last three periods (P27\u2013P29 demands = 379, 394, 402) show a further sustained higher level. To keep service while avoiding excessive holding cost, I set L using observed lead times (calculate) which confirms 0 actual lead time. For demand I use a short recent window to capture the newest regime: mu_hat recent_N with N=3 (uses P27\u2013P29 mean scaled by 1+L) so the OR engine targets inventory appropriate for the current elevated demand. Volatility also updated with recent_N N=3 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices respond quickly to the recent upward shift while leveraging confirmed lead-time=0 to avoid over-pipelining inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: avg increased from 317 (Periods 20\u201326) to 391.67 (Periods 27\u201329) (+23.6%)

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 start. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we have no coverage for the current-period demand; all past concluded periods show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Demand has shown multiple upward regime shifts, with the most recent regime (Periods 27\u201330) at a higher level (Period demands: 379, 394, 402, 457). To capture the current high-demand regime and keep orders responsive, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0, supported by consistent concluded arrivals). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=4 to base the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent four periods (Periods 27\u201330) so the base-stock reflects the current elevated demand. For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent demand variability rather than diluting with older, lower-demand history. This combination keeps target inventory aligned to the new regime, reducing stockouts during the ongoing high-demand phase while avoiding excessive smoothing from older data.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32 context: on-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (every past order concluded with lead_time=0). Recent demand regime: a sustained high-demand regime began at Period_27 (carry-over notes); most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 27\u201331 = 379, 394, 402, 457, 402) show elevated mean and similar volatility. Given confirmed same-period arrivals historically and the clear regime established at Period_27, I use the promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to keep forecasts responsive to the new higher demand while limiting holding cost. Choosing recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) gives the OR engine a forecast centered on the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5) and its recent volatility, which increases target base stock to avoid lost sales but keeps cap constraints in place to limit excessive inventory and holding cost. This balances the high profit ($4) per unit against $1 holding cost per unit-period by prioritizing service in the current high-demand regime while relying on the capped order quantity to curb overstock risk.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 across many periods) and recent sustained demand increases with a confirmed regime change around Period 27 (higher demand since P27). I therefore keep lead time at the promised/default (0) because concluded history supports it. For demand forecasting I focus on the most recent regime (Periods 27\u201332) where demand has been elevated; I select recent_N with N=6 to capture the last 6 periods' demand behavior (this balances responsiveness to the higher regime while using at least 3 samples). I apply the same recent_N window for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices give the OR backend an (1+L)-period forecast centered on the current high-demand regime, increasing the base-stock to reduce stockouts while sigma estimated from recent data limits excessive safety stock given holding cost.

Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201333) consistently show orders arriving same period (arrived X units ordered on same Period Y, lead_time was 0 periods), so actual lead time = 0. Demand has experienced sustained upward regime shifts previously (noted in carry-overs); the most recent sustained high-demand regime began at Period 27 (Periods 27\u201333 show substantially higher demand than earlier). To keep the OR engine focused on recent elevated demand while recognizing lead time = 0, I set L using observed lead times (calculate). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 27\u201333) because the recent regime length is 7 periods, which captures the current higher demand level and recent volatility and is within the allowed N bounds. These settings concentrate safety stock on the current high-demand regime, improving service levels while limiting excess holding cost since L=0 reduces pipeline uncertainty.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 in all concluded periods), and recent demand has been escalating (Periods 20\u201334 much higher than early periods). With promised lead time = 0 and confirmed actual lead time = 0 from concluded history, I use the default lead time to let the OR engine assume promised behavior. I select default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively, letting it incorporate the full historic demand pattern (including the recent higher-demand regime) into base-stock and cap calculations. This balances service level (capturing higher recent demand in the full-sample mean) against holding cost given high profit-to-holding ratio ($4 vs $1). Using defaults avoids overfitting short-term noise while relying on the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so I keep L = promised (default). To ensure the OR backend targets the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent stable high-demand window). This balances service (meeting much higher current demand) against holding cost by focusing the forecast and variability on the latest regime rather than diluting with older, much lower demand periods.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37: recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (many concluded messages with lead_time=0), on-hand=10, in-transit=0. Profit $4 vs holding $1 implies q = 4/(4+1)=0.8, so backend will target a high service level (large z*). Historical concluded demand has had multiple sustained upward regime shifts already recorded in carry-over; recent periods (31\u201336) show high absolute demand but no clear new, sustained regime change beyond those already noted. Promised lead time remains accurate (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly), so use default lead time to let the OR engine use promised L=0. For demand forecast and volatility, use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all historical samples \u2014 this leverages the full sample set and the OR engine's capped ordering rule to balance service level (via high q) against holding costs. With on-hand=10 and no in-transit, the backend will top up toward the computed base stock; defaults are appropriate given stable verified lead time and no new sustained demand regime change.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 context: all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 32\u201337) is substantially higher than earlier periods (sustained uplift over 6 periods). I therefore (1) set lead time to the empirically observed average (calculate) = 0, (2) use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the new higher regime using the last 6 periods (Periods 32\u201337) so the OR engine sets base stock to cover the higher demand, and (3) use recent_N for volatility to reflect recent variability. These choices ensure the backend orders enough to reduce stockouts under the new demand regime while letting the OR engine's cap and service-level logic control overstock given the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: avg increased from 391.67 (Periods 27\u201331) to 538.83 (Periods 32\u201337) (+37.6%)

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 start. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 while demand has been in a higher regime since about Period 32 (Periods 32\u201338 show large, sustained demand increases versus earlier). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history (multiple confirms), so I'll trust the promised lead time. To keep service during this elevated regime I use recent_N for demand estimates focused on the most recent regime: N=7 (Periods 32\u201338) captures the current higher mean and volatility so the OR engine will target a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost under the current demand level. Sigma is also set using recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. No pipeline arrivals are expected this period, so these parameters will drive an immediate order to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand and the safety stock implied by the backend.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has consistently been 0 (many periods), so using promised lead time is safe. Recent demand is in a sustained high regime: Periods 32\u201339 demands = [507, 518, 492, 591, 549, 576, 614, 648], recent mean \u2248 562 units. Inventory is currently zero and no pipeline exists, so we must replenish to cover the high current-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0 lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the current elevated demand regime (changepoint detected earlier at Period 32; using the most recent stable window avoids diluting the forecast with much lower older periods). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)\xd7recent-mean demand forecast (~562) and a recent volatility estimate for safety stock; together with the backend's service-level calculation (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/(4+1)=0.8), the base-stock will aim to cover the elevated demand while the cap limits extreme orders. Using recent data prevents under-ordering into this sustained high-demand regime and balances holding cost by relying on the backend cap and z-selection.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201340) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (every concluded arrival states lead_time was 0). Recent demand has been high (periods 32\u201340 show sustained elevated demand vs early periods), but no new, distinct changepoint since the last recorded insights. Given confirmed lead time = promised (0) and ample historical demand samples, I use the backend defaults so it computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This lets the OR engine produce a base-stock that balances the profit/holding tradeoff using q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/(4+1)=0.8 while respecting the engine cap. Default choices are conservative given zero on-hand/pipeline and avoid overfitting to very recent volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1752.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 decision. Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals indicate lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we have no coverage for upcoming demand. Demand has clearly been in the high regime since Period 32 \u2014 recent 10 periods (P32\u2013P41) demands = [507,518,492,591,549,576,614,648,649,755], recent mean \u2248 589.9. I therefore set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 consistently. For the demand forecast across the review+lead period I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (regime length = 10 periods from P32\u2013P41). This gives mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples, which matches the OR backend's expectation to protect service level in this new, sustained high-demand regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=10 so the backend sizes safety stock to the observed recent volatility rather than long-ago, lower-variance samples. These choices prioritize meeting high current demand (profit $4 vs holding $1) while limiting excess inventory by using only the recent regime for mean and volatility estimation.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 context: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (orders placed each period have arrived the same period throughout history). Demand has exhibited multiple upward regime shifts; recent high-demand regime appears to start around Period 32 and continues through Period 42 (sustained elevated demand). Given zero observed lead time and no overdue shipments, I keep L as the promised/default (0). To capture the recent elevated demand level and recent volatility, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent regime. I choose N=11 (Periods 32\u201342 inclusive, regime length = 11) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand based on the latest sustained high-demand observations. This increases target base stock to reduce stockouts in this clearly higher-demand regime while sigma_hat using the same recent window captures current variability so the OR engine's safety stock balances service level (profit/$4 per unit) against $1 holding cost. With on-hand + in-transit = 0, this approach prompts replenishment sized to recent realized demand and avoids under-ordering that would cause lost sales in the current high-demand regime.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Profit = $4/unit, Holding = $1/unit/period. Historical concluded data show actual lead time = 0 for every observed order (consistent, same-period arrivals). Recent demand has stepped up substantially: Periods 40\u201343 demands = [649, 755, 741, 774], average \u2248 729.75, well above earlier regimes. Because arrivals are same-period (L=0) and pipeline is empty, we must target next-period service using the most recent high-demand regime. I choose L = default to use the promised lead time (0) since concluded history confirms lead time = 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the latest high-demand regime (Periods 40\u201343). This focuses the base-stock on the current demand level and recent volatility so the OR backend increases order quantities to satisfy the elevated demand while limiting excess holding by not blending in much older, lower-demand data. Using the last 4 periods keeps responsiveness high given a clear, sustained shift over at least 3+ periods and the empty pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 40: avg increased from 538.83 (Periods 32\u201337) to 729.75 (Periods 40\u201343) (+35%), sustained for 4 periods

To capture the most-recent regime while keeping variance estimation responsive, I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets base-stock to cover the current high-demand level ((1+L)*recent mean) and a volatility aligned with the latest variability. This choice prioritizes service (avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand regime) while the backend's cap will limit extreme orders and holding cost is moderate ($1/unit) relative to profit ($4/unit). No in-transit or on-hand inventory is available, so ordering to meet the recent high mean is appropriate.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 decision. Historical concludes show promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals have lead_time=0 (confirmed repeatedly since Period 1), so I trust L=0. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand. Demand has undergone several sustained upward regime shifts recorded in carry-over history; most recently a sustained high regime beginning at Period 40 (demands Periods 40\u201345 = 649,755,741,774,845,919). I therefore use a recent-window forecast to capture the current high-demand regime. I choose recent_N with N=6 (Periods 40\u201345) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat: N equals the recent regime length (6), bounded by the rules (\u22653). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period forecast based on the most relevant recent mean and volatility rather than diluting it with older, much lower-demand data. Using recent data also helps the backend's base-stock calculation reflect the high service level implied by profit/(profit+holding)=0.8 while avoiding excessive holding from mixing older low-demand periods. No overdue or missing shipments are present (no in-transit or delayed arrivals).

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 start. Historical concluded messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 in many periods), and current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has entered a sustained high regime beginning around Period 40 (periods 40\u201346 demands: 649, 755, 741, 774, 845, 919, 930). I set L to default (promised lead time 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms actual lead time = 0. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (the recent regime length: Periods 40\u201346). This biases the base-stock calculation toward current elevated demand and ensures the OR backend orders enough to meet the high service-level implied by profit vs holding cost while keeping safety stock sized to recent volatility. No overdue shipments are present (in-transit=0), so no explicit lead-time extension is needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3552.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201347) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so using the promised/default lead time is appropriate. Demand has trended upward through several documented regime shifts; the full sample mean (Periods 1\u201347) is ~393 units/period. With no in-transit stock and high recent demand, we need the OR backend to target the full-sample demand level to restore pipeline quickly while the lead time remains 0. I therefore select default lead time (use promised 0) and allow the backend to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample (default methods). This balances service (high profit relative to holding cost) by sizing base-stock from the overall observed demand distribution while letting the OR engine apply its capped ordering logic to limit over-ordering.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2320.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. Context: chips(Regular) profit $4/unit, holding $1/unit. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (many periods), and recent demand has moved into a sustained high regime since around Period 40 (demand from Periods 40\u201348 consistently very high). I therefore use the promised/default lead time (L=0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period fulfillment historically. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 40\u201348 inclusive = 9 periods) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of those recent samples and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. Choosing recent_N=9 keeps the base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while avoiding dilution by older, much lower-demand periods. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand/in-transit) versus holding cost by focusing safety stock on recent volatility rather than long-term averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3828.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: recent history shows consistently zero on-hand and zero in-transit at decision time, while observed demand has risen sharply in the last several periods. Demand samples (Periods 45\u201349) = [919, 930, 986, 1036, 1104], recent average ~995 units/period. Promised lead time = 0 and every concluded arrival for many periods lists lead_time=0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). I therefore keep lead time as default (promised 0). Because demand has a clear, sustained upward shift starting after Period 44, I bias the forecast to the most recent 5 periods to capture the new higher regime: mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demands. Volatility is also elevated, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. On-hand + pipeline = 0, so orders will need to cover current-period demand; using recent_N (N=5) increases the base-stock to target service given higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a relatively high target service level). These parameters let the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to the new high-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to older, lower-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 45: avg increased from 729.75 (Periods 40\u201343) to 995.0 (Periods 45\u201349) (+36%), sustained for 5 periods
