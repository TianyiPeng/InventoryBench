The most relevant anchor for the current period is the Period_1 sample (75 units). c) Lead-time / missing-order risk: Supplier promised lead time = 0, but actual lead time can differ and must be inferred only from conclude messages (none available yet). Because actual lead time is unknown, orders may either arrive same-period or be delayed; lost shipments are possible. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. There is no confirmed arrival history to rely on. e) Final order logic: Profit per unit ($19) is large compared to holding cost ($1/period), so the cost of a stockout (lost profit) is much higher than the modest holding penalty. I therefore order to cover the expected current-period demand based on the most relevant sample (Period_1=75). I avoid substantial over-ordering because lead-time uncertainty could delay/destroy shipments and because holding cost will apply next period. Therefore place order = 75 units to satisfy expected demand this period while keeping inventory risk moderate.",

No in-transit; supplier appears to be fulfilling with 0 actual lead time so far. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand =0, in-transit =0, so only a new order can satisfy Period_2 demand. Because actual lead time observed = 0, an order placed now should arrive in time to meet Period_2 demand. e) Final order logic: Given observed unmet demand in Period_1 and the provided Period_2 sample demand = 90, I plan to supply for the expected demand rather than understock. Marginal profit per sold unit is high ($19) relative to holding cost ($1), so the cost of a modest overstock is small compared to lost sales.

The provided historical sample set also lists Period_3 demand=0 and higher later-period demands (P4=170, P5=127), but the immediate live evidence (P1\u219279, P2\u2192114) suggests demand is at least in the 80\u2013120 range and possibly rising. c) Lead time / missing orders: concluded messages show orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived same period (lead_time observed = 0 in both cases). This is only 2 periods of evidence, so not yet a 3+ period sustained confirmation per carry-over rules, but it strongly suggests same-period arrival. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Because arrivals appear to be same-period, an order placed now will arrive before demand is realized this period, allowing us to satisfy demand. e) Final order logic: marginal profit per sold unit ($19) far exceeds one-period holding cost ($1), so the cost of understocking (lost $19 per unit of unmet demand) is much larger than modest holding cost. Given recent realized demand (79,114) and upward signal in the sample data, I place a moderately aggressive order to capture expected demand while accepting small holding risk.

Recent 3-period average demand = (79+114+164)/3 = 119 units, with a clear upward trend. c) Lead_time vs. missing orders: Orders in Periods 1\u20133 all arrived in the same period they were ordered (Period1 order arrived Period1, Period2 arrived Period2, Period3 arrived Period3).

P24 (271) was a stockout (ordered=0 arrived=0) so true demand that period could have been even higher; P25 (182) and P26 (60) show high variability. A simple short-run forecast using the most recent three concluded periods (P24\u2013P26) gives mean \u2248 (271+182+60)/3 = 171. c) Lead time / missing orders: History and provided carry-over insight confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (orders have consistently arrived same period). No evidence of lost shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 128, in-transit = 0. With L=0, any order placed now will arrive for Period 27 demand. To meet the short-run expected demand (~171) we need about 43 more units (171 \u2212 128). Given demand uncertainty and the high profit per unit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1/unit/period), it is profitable to bias toward meeting demand rather than risking lost sales. However, holding is nonzero so avoid large overstock. e) Final order logic: Order enough to bring on-hand close to the short-run demand forecast with a small safety buffer. Target on-hand \u2248 170\u2013180. Current on-hand 128 \u2192 order 50 units (results in ~178 on-hand this period), which balances service level vs. holding cost given demand volatility.",
