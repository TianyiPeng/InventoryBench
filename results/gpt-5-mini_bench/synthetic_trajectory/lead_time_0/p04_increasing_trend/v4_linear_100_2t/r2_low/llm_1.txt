For the current Period_1, the most relevant datum is the observed Period_1 sample = 75. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0 but we have no conclude messages yet to verify actual lead time; actual lead time could be \u22650 or shipments could be lost. With no evidence, I must balance risk of stockout vs. holding cost. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit = $1/unit, so carrying inventory into the next period erodes expected profit one-for-one. That makes overstocking costly. e) Final order logic: Aim to meet expected demand for the immediate period without building extra safety stock because holding cost negates profit if inventory is carried forward and we have no confirmed persistent lead-time or demand regime shift. Use the Period_1 historical demand (75 units) as the best single-period forecast. Therefore place an order of 75 units to cover expected Period_1 demand while minimizing ending inventory risk.",

Period_1 experienced high realized demand (132) but we had only 75 on-hand and sold out; this suggests demand can exceed shipments but we have no sustained multi-period shift signal. c) Lead time / orders: Period_1 order (75) arrived in Period_1 and the conclude message states lead_time was 0 periods; therefore same-period arrivals are possible. This is a single-period observation only (not yet a 3+ period confirmed change). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With confirmed 0-period lead time (orders arrive during the same period they are placed), an order placed now will be available to meet Period_2 demand. e) Final order logic: Profit = $1/unit and holding = $1/unit/period.

These indicate typical demand in the ~90\u2013130 range with stockouts in past periods, so true demand likely \u226590. The separate provided sample for Period_3=0 appears as an isolated sample in the earlier dataset and conflicts with the observed concluded sales pattern; I give greater weight to the actual concluded demands. c) Lead time / shipments: Concluded messages for Period1 and Period2 both state arrivals were same-period (lead_time=0). No evidence of delays or lost shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With supplier lead_time=0 historically, an order placed now should arrive in Period 3 and can be used to satisfy Period 3 demand. e) Order logic: Profit per unit = $1, holding cost = $1/period, so leftover inventory carries a full-period cost equal to the unit profit; overstock is costly. To balance stockout risk vs. holding cost, order close to expected period demand. Given two recent observed demands of 132 and 100 (both larger than prior orders), I choose a conservative target near the lower recent observed demand to reduce risk of heavy leftover holding cost while still serving most demand.

Earlier carry-over noted a sustained demand increase beginning at Period 11; that remains the baseline. c) Lead time / missing orders: History shows every placed order that was reported arrived in the same period it was ordered; prior confirmed insight (Period 4) indicates actual lead time = 0 periods.

Given high demand variance but confirmed zero lead time, it's optimal to target expected demand for the period rather than carry safety stock.
