Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time; use promised lead time (default). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean=315.4 units/period and std=144.0. With promised L=0, using default formulas gives mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 315.4 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std = 144.0. These default settings provide the OR backend with a baseline forecast and variability consistent with the full sample history while avoiding premature adjustments from limited/no arrival evidence. This balances service level (using historical mean) against holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/unit), letting the OR engine compute the appropriate safety stock (via its q and cap calculations).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-48.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_2. Current on-hand = 182, in-transit = 0. Last concluded period shows Period_1 demand = 134 and an order placed in Period_1 arrived same period (observed lead_time = 0). Historical demand samples show a clear upward trend across the five samples (Period_1..5 = [107,252,298,376,544]) indicating a higher recent mean than the earliest observation. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded evidence confirms 0-period arrivals so far. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained upward regime across the available samples so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=5) to let the backend estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices increase replenishment targets to maintain service given rising demand while relying on observed short lead time to avoid unnecessary extra pipeline. This balances profit-driven service (profit = holding cost, so higher service requires careful sizing) against holding cost by using recent data rather than long-run averages.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed across Period_1..Period_5: sample series [107,252,298,376,544], mean = 315.4; clear upward trend (Period_1\u2192Period_5 +408 units, +381%).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period = 3. Demand history shows a clear upward trend across samples [107,252,298,376,544] (mean=315.4) with recent periods much higher. On-hand=96, in-transit=0 and both concluded orders (P1,P2) had lead_time=0 so no overdue shipments. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because concluded lead-time observations (two arrivals) confirm same-period arrivals. To capture the recent upward regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 (last 3 demands: 298,376,544 => higher recent mean) so the OR engine will target (1+L)*recent mean and better match current demand. I also use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the most recent regime. These choices increase the target base-stock to avoid stockouts given rapidly rising demand while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the OR formula.

Daily Reward (R_t): $301.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision. Historical demand series (provided) shows a clear upward regime (mean\u2248315.4 over Period_1..Period_5). Concluded arrivals show three consecutive same-period arrivals: Period1 order arrived in Period1, Period2\u2192Period2, Period3\u2192Period3 \u2014 consistent evidence that actual lead time is 0. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish for current period demand plus cover short lead time. I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times (will average concluded lead times, confirming L\u22480). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime across all provided samples (use the (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). For sigma_hat I use 'default' so the backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service level and holding cost: recent_N for mu_hat ensures we target higher average demand and avoid stockouts under the established upward regime; default sigma gives conservative spread for safety stock; calculating L from observations prevents overstating lead time and reduces unnecessary inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $308.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Context: observed demand samples for chips(Regular) = [107,252,298,376,544], sample mean = 315.4 with a clear upward trend from Period_1\u2192Period_5 (+408 units). On-hand = 8, in-transit = 0; promised lead time = 0 and concluded history shows arrivals each period on-time (observed lead times = 0). Given confirmed same-period arrivals and a sustained higher-demand regime, I keep L at the promised/default (0) so the OR engine uses same-period replenishment. I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples \u2014 this encodes the elevated mean (315.4) and observed variability into the base-stock calculation, raising target inventory to meet the new regime. This balances service (higher safety stock because profit=holding cost -> 50% critical fractile) against holding cost; using all historical samples is conservative but appropriate because the upward shift is already reflected across the full sample set and lead time is stable. I flag current low on-hand (8) and zero in-transit; the OR backend\u2019s capped order will top up toward the calculated base stock while respecting the cap to limit over-ordering.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision. Context: profit = $1/unit, holding = $1/unit/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (from problem): [107,252,298,376,544] show a clear upward regime; the most recent observations are substantially higher. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded messages (orders placed in P1..P5 arrived same period). Because LT=0 is confirmed and demand has shifted upward recently, I prioritize responsiveness to recent high demand while keeping the OR engine aware of the confirmed short lead time. Therefore: set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the latest high-demand regime (focus on the last 3 samples of the provided series). This increases the forecast and variability the OR engine uses, boosting target base-stock to reduce stockouts during the sustained upward trend while the confirmed zero lead time prevents excessive safety stock buildup. No signs of lost shipments to adjust L upward.

Daily Reward (R_t): $378.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show a clear upward trend across the last 6 periods (Period_1..Period_6: 107,252,298,376,544,616) with recent demands much higher than early samples; lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded messages. There are no overdue or in-transit arrivals to expect this period. To prioritize service (avoid stockouts) given profit=$1 and holding=$1 (service quantile q=0.5 implying z*=0), I bias the forecast toward recent demand: set L to default (promised lead time = 0, supported by concluded arrivals), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent window to capture the elevated recent mean and volatility. I choose recent_N with N=5 (using the most recent 5 concluded demand samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean_of_last_5 and sqrt(1+L)*std_of_last_5; this raises target base-stock to reflect the sustained upward regime while keeping safety sizing aligned with recent volatility. This approach balances higher service given rising demand while avoiding excessive holding costs by not overreacting to a single extreme period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $395.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 across Periods 1\u20137, so use calculated lead time based on observations. Demand has accelerated sharply: concluded demands P1..P7 = [134,225,338,316,479,616,687]; the most recent three periods (P5\u2013P7) form a new, higher regime (means ~594 units) and are sustained for 3 periods, so I use recent_N=3 to forecast mean and volatility. Using recent_N concentrates orders to cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean and captures higher variance, improving service while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost equals profit ($1 each). These choices help the OR backend raise the base stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping cap constraints in mind and relying on confirmed lead time=0 to avoid extra pipeline padding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period5: avg demand increased from 315.4 (P1\u2013P5 baseline) to 594.0 (P5\u2013P7) \u2014 +88%; sustained for 3 periods (P5,P6,P7).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (orders placed each period arrived that period through Period_8). Recent demand clearly elevated since Period_5 (demands: P5=479, P6=616, P7=687, P8=800). Given confirmed lead time=0 historically and a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period_5, I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (Period_5..Period_8). Using the recent 4-period mean will raise the base-stock to meet current demand while sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 captures recent volatility. These choices aim to reduce stockouts under the higher demand regime while keeping holding cost in check by not inflating forecasts with older low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $646.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times for Periods 1\u20139 consistently show arrivals same-period (lead_time=0), so actual lead time remains 0. Demand has a clear upward shift beginning at Period 5: recent realized demands (Periods 5\u20139) = [479,616,687,800,943], mean = 705.0, which is materially above the earlier baseline. Because profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) the OR backend will target a 50% critical fractile, so accurate mean forecast across the review+lead window matters most; volatility affects cap but we still need to reflect the new higher mean. I therefore (1) keep L = promised (default) since concluded data confirms lead time = 0, and (2) set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N = 5 (Periods 5\u20139) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. N=5 chosen because a changepoint is evident at Period 5 and we want to use the most recent 3\u201320 rule, selecting 5 to balance recency and sample stability. Using recent demand samples raises the base-stock target to meet current elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures the increased volatility from the higher-demand regime. This helps the OR backend avoid chronic stockouts (by increasing mu_hat) while keeping holding cost managed through the capped order policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 9: avg demand for Periods 5\u20139 = 705.0, up from prior reported 594.0 (P5\u2013P7) [+18.7%]; sustained high demand across 5 recent periods.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 start. Recent demand has risen sharply and sustained: Periods 6\u201310 demand = [616, 687, 800, 943, 1021], recent 5-period mean = 813.4, volatility elevated. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P10 arrived same period). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2192 no coverage for upcoming demand. Promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time confirms 0, so set L to default (promised). To reflect the sustained high-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat with N=5 (captures P6\u2013P10 mean = 813.4, (1+L) multiplier =1). Volatility has also increased, so I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 so the OR engine computes safety stock using the recent std. This choice emphasizes meeting service with minimal lost sales given profit = holding cost (q\u22480.5), while avoiding excessive inventory by grounding forecasts in the most recent sustained high-demand regime. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1..P11) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand has shifted into a higher regime starting at Period_5 and has remained elevated through Period_11 (seven consecutive high-demand periods). Given confirmed same-period arrivals, I set L using observed lead times. For demand sizing I use a recent-N estimate to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u201311) rather than diluting with earlier low-volume periods. N=7 (Periods 5\u201311) captures the current regime length. I apply the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices raise the base-stock (mu_hat) to meet current high demand while sigma_hat reflects recent variability so the OR backend can compute an appropriate safety stock; using recent data avoids under-ordering in this elevated regime and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 11: avg demand for Periods 5\u201311 = 820.0, up from prior reported 705.0 (+16.3%); sustained high demand across 7 periods (P5\u2013P11).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201312) confirm actual lead time = 0 each period. Demand has shifted to a higher regime sustained across the most recent 7 periods (Periods 6\u201312: demands = [616, 687, 800, 943, 1021, 1194, 1137], mean = 914.0). Given the confirmed zero lead time and a sustained high-demand regime of 7 periods, I set L to the promised/default (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 to target the current high-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over these 7 samples). This increases target base-stock to meet the higher realized demand while keeping variance estimated from the same recent window. This choice balances service (avoid stockouts given past full-period stockouts) against holding cost given profit = holding cost (symmetric critical ratio).

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders placed arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 5 through Period 13 (large upward trend and sustained high sales). With profit = holding ($1 each), critical service/holding trade-off is balanced (q = 0.5), so we should size the review+lead demand forecast to recent high-demand regime. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0), because concluded history consistently confirms 0 lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 (covering Periods 5\u201313, the recent sustained high-demand regime length = 9). This focuses the OR engine on the most recent high-demand mean and volatility so base_stock will reflect current elevated demand while the capped cap prevents extreme one-shot orders. Given on-hand + pipeline = 0, this approach tells the OR backend to replenish to a base_stock appropriate for the latest high-demand regime and balances service level vs holding cost under equal profit/holding.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods (P1..P14 arrivals matched same-period orders). Demand shows a sustained, large upward regime since Period 5 and especially high values in the most recent periods (P8\u2013P14). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2192 we must replenish to cover current period demand and near-term high demand. No overdue shipments detected. Given the confirmed short lead time and rapidly rising recent demand, I choose to rely on recent demand samples rather than the long-run baseline. L: use 'calculate' so the backend will compute the average of observed lead times (which are all 0) and therefore keep lead time at 0 while explicitly reflecting observed data. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=7 to target the most recent regime (last 7 periods P8\u2013P14) which capture the persistent elevated demand; this makes (1+L)\xd7mean reflect the current high-demand level and avoid underordering from older low-demand samples. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=7 to base volatility on the same recent window so safety stock scales to recent variability. These settings push the OR backend to raise the base stock to meet the now-sustained high demand while keeping holding cost awareness (profit and holding cost equal yields moderate service-level z*).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show a sustained high-demand regime since Period 5 with recent demands: P5..P15 = [479,616,687,800,943,1021,1194,1137,1381,1326,1672]; avg(P5..P15)=1023.27 (11 periods). All concluded orders arrived same period (lead_time observed = 0 consistently). Given the clear, sustained upward regime (11 periods) I set lead time to the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand sizing I use a recent_N approach over the detected regime (N=11) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 11 samples (captures the new higher mean). I also set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture current volatility. This keeps the OR backend focused on the elevated demand level while letting its internal service-level math (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5) pick the safety-stock tradeoff. With on-hand and in-transit at zero, these parameters direct the optimizer to replenish to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand under the confirmed high-demand regime and account for observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 15: avg demand for Periods 5\u201315 = 1023.27, up from prior reported 820.0 (Periods 5\u201311) (+24.7%); sustained high demand across 11 periods (P5\u2013P15).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 for many periods) and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 5 with demand growing through Period 16. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand regime: recent high-demand regime spans many periods (Periods 5\u201316); to capture the current elevated mean and variability I use recent_N on the most recent regime. I choose N=11 to cover the sustained high-demand window (Periods 5\u201315/16 approximate regime length) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current elevated average and volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher expected demand while the cap in the OR engine will limit extreme over-ordering; using recent data helps balance service level vs. holding cost under the new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1120.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 5 (multiple periods with large demands, e.g., Periods 13\u201317 demands 1381,1326,1672,1542,1687). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to cover (1+L) review+lead demand. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 periods every concluded period (orders placed arrived same period repeatedly), so promised lead time is validated. I select L = default to use the promised lead time (0). Demand has a clear changepoint before Period 5 and has remained in the high regime for many periods (regime length from P5\u2013P17 = 13), so I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N = 13 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the most relevant recent high-demand samples. This places the base-stock level close to the recent elevated mean demand (improving service) while sigma_hat based on recent variance prevents underestimating uncertainty; together they help the OR engine balance service level against holding cost given profit=holding, by targeting the empirical high-demand mean and variability rather than diluting with much lower early-period observations.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: recent demand has been substantially higher and sustained since Period_5 (multiple periods with demand >> early baseline). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand. Observed concluded arrivals for prior periods consistently show lead time = 0 (orders placed in a period arrive that same period), so use the promised/default lead time (0). To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime: the high-demand regime runs from Period_5 through recent periods (length ~14), so I choose N=14 to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 14 samples. This biases ordering toward meeting the elevated demand while the backend's capped order limit still tempers order size to control holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1163.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 context: observed demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 5, with recent periods (P15\u2013P19) showing particularly strong demand and no on-hand or in-transit inventory (On-hand=0, In-transit=0). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (orders arriving same period), so using the default promised lead time is appropriate. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N on demand estimates, taking the last 15 periods (Periods 5\u201319) which represent the current regime length. This gives the OR engine a forecast that reflects the elevated demand while keeping variability estimated from the same recent window. With Profit = Holding, the backend will set a service-level balancing reorder quantity; using recent data helps avoid underordering into this sustained high-demand period. No overdue shipments are evident (arrivals always concluded same period), so no explicit lead-time extension is used.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 19: avg demand for Periods 5\u201319 = 1217.6, up from prior reported 1023.27 (+19.1%); sustained high demand across 15 periods (P5\u2013P19).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders placed in P1..P20 all arrived same period). Demand has exhibited a sustained, large upward regime since Period 5; recent periods (P5..P20) show much higher demand than P1\u2013P4. Because the demand regime is sustained and recent data is most informative for the OR engine's base-stock calculation, I select lead time = default (use promised 0). For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N over the most recent regime to capture elevated sales levels and higher variability so the OR backend raises base_stock and the cap appropriately. I choose N=16 (Periods 5\u201320 constitute a sustained high-demand regime of length 16), which balances responsiveness to the new regime while using enough samples for stable estimates. These parameters instruct the OR engine to target a higher service level appropriate to the sustained demand spike while letting its capped-order rule limit overly large single-period orders.

Demand forecast (mu_hat) uses recent_N with N=5 (Periods 17\u201321) to capture the current high-demand regime \u2014 these five most recent demands are 1687, 1793, 1986, 1875, 1995 (mean \u2248 1867.2); using recent data avoids diluting the forecast with much lower early-period demand. sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=5 to estimate volatility from the same recent window, reflecting the current variability around the elevated mean. Choosing recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat directs the OR backend to size base-stock around the current high-demand regime, balancing service (profit = $1/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period). With on-hand and in-transit = 0 and lead time = 0, this increases the order recommendation now so on-hand inventory is available for today's demand and reduces stockouts under the sustained elevated demand.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23: lead time history shows consistent same-period arrivals (many concluded messages with arrived=ordered and lead_time=0), so promised lead time remains accurate. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 5 with continuing increases through Period 22; recent history (Periods 5\u201322) supplies the best estimate for near-term demand. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover this elevated demand. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded messages repeatedly confirm 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 5\u201322) to capture the sustained high-demand level; available regime length = 18, so N=18 (fits the rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). Using recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N captures recent volatility rather than the much lower-variance early periods. These choices steer the OR backend to set a base-stock reflecting the current high-demand regime and a volatility estimate based on recent data so orders are large enough to meet service needs but still account for holding cost tradeoffs.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 decision. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (arrivals every period for orders placed same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has undergone a sustained upward regime since Period_5 and remains elevated through Period_23; to capture the recent sustained high-demand regime I use a recent_N demand estimate that emphasizes the most recent 19 periods (Periods 5\u201323). This lets the OR backend compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 19 samples) and sigma_hat based on the same window, reflecting the sustained higher mean and recent volatility. Rationale for choices: (1) L="default" because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0-period actual lead time; (2) mu_hat recent_N (N=19) captures the long, sustained high-demand regime and will raise the base-stock to avoid lost sales during ongoing high demand; (3) sigma_hat recent_N (N=19) uses recent volatility so safety stock scales to current variability. Given profit = holding cost, the backend will set service percentile at 50%, but using recent higher mean and volatility reduces stockouts while limiting excessive holding given equal unit profit and holding cost.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201324) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand has a clear, sustained upward regime since Period_5, with very large recent demands (Periods 20\u201324: 1875,1995,2218,2449,2460). Because profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) the backend's target service quantile is 0.5 (z*\u22480) so the OR engine will center base-stock near the demand forecast; to avoid overreacting to older low-demand data I use a recent-window forecast. I select recent_N with N=5 (Periods 20\u201324) so mu_hat reflects the most recent high-demand level (mean \u22482199.4) and sigma_hat reflects recent volatility. With L=default (promised lead time 0, confirmed by concludes) the forecast covers the immediate period (1+L=1). Given pipeline=0 this will prompt ordering to meet the recent high demand while limiting excess inventory from older low-demand history.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period (many confirms P1\u2192P25), so I trust promised lead time. Demand has exhibited a sustained, large upward regime since Period 5; recent periods (P6\u2013P25) remain elevated. To have the OR engine respond quickly to the high demand while limiting excess holding cost, I use L=default (promised lead time = 0) and compute demand estimates from the most recent regime using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 samples = P6\u2013P25) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This gives the backend a (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility focused on the current high-demand regime, improving service without over-weighting older low-demand periods. Using recent_N for sigma_hat also ensures safety stock reflects recent variance, and limiting N to 20 follows the recommended cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 25: avg demand for Periods 5\u201325 = 1503.33, up from prior reported 1217.6 (+23.5%); sustained high demand across 21 periods (P5\u2013P25).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in every concluded period (orders placed each period arrived same period through Period_26), so use the promised/default lead time. Demand has a clear, sustained upward regime starting around Period_5 and continuing through Period_26; recent demands are much higher (examples: P22=2218, P23=2449, P24=2460, P25=2309, P26=2427). To capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise, I use a recent_N approach using a large recent window capped at 20 periods (the policy guidance suggests N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). This will focus forecasts on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201326) rather than the much lower early-period values. Specifically: L=default (promised lead time 0, confirmed by concludes); mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to set (1+L)*mean over the last 20 demand samples, which raises the base-stock to meet current demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to estimate variability from the same recent window. This combination gives the OR backend an up-to-date demand mean and volatility while keeping lead time at the confirmed 0, balancing high service level (profit and lost sales risk) against holding cost given holding cost equals profit ($1 each).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes through Period 27 show consistent same-day arrivals (orders in P1..P27 all arrived in same period) so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand has trended sharply upward and remains elevated; recent five-period demands (Periods 23\u201327 = 2449, 2460, 2309, 2427, 2565) average \u22482442 units. To balance service (profit=$1/unit) vs holding cost ($1/unit/period) I use a short recent-window forecast so the OR backend targets stock to cover the most recent high-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding. Therefore: L set to default (promised lead time = 0, consistent with observed concludes); mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand level (1+L times mean of last 5 samples); sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility for safety stock sizing. This combination keeps orders responsive to the ongoing high-demand regime and leverages the confirmed zero lead time so inventory is not inflated unnecessarily.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (every concluded period: ordered arrived same period). Demand has shown a sustained upward regime since Period 5 with accelerating volumes; recent periods (most recent 20) represent the current high-demand regime. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so the OR backend uses q=0.5 (z*=0) making base_stock = mu_hat; therefore mu_hat should reflect the elevated recent demand to avoid stockouts. I choose L='calculate' to confirm actual lead time=0 from observed arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (caps N per rules). With L=0 the backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 20 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(last 20 samples); this raises the base stock to match current demand while sigma_hat (used in the cap) controls order capping to limit overly large single-period orders. Given on-hand and in-transit are zero, these choices prioritize service (reduce lost sales) while the cap and sigma estimate limit excess holding.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1..P29) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (every order concluded with lead_time 0), and demand has shown a sustained, large upward regime since Period 5. Recent realized demands (Periods 10\u201329) are much higher than early-sample levels, so I bias the forecast toward recent history to capture the higher current mean and volatility. I set L to "default" to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded evidence strongly confirms actual lead time = 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent 20 demand observations (this follows the guideline to use up to 20 periods of the current sustained regime). Using recent_N increases ordered quantities to meet the elevated recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N raises the safety buffer to reflect higher variability; this balances the 50% service quantile implied by profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 against holding costs, reducing stockouts while avoiding unchecked overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time consistently observed as 0 periods across many periods (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand has undergone a sustained upward regime starting at Period 5 and remains elevated through Period 30. To capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility, I set lead time to the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms L=0. For demand magnitude I use a recent_N estimate over the most recent 20 periods to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while giving more weight to the latest observations; N=20 is chosen because the recent high-demand regime spans many periods (>>20) and the policy guidance caps N at 20. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N ensures the OR backend computes variability from the same recent window. These choices provide the OR engine with a forecast (mu_hat) and variability (sigma_hat) aligned to the current elevated demand so the base-stock will prioritize service (higher \u03bc\u0302) while the backend's cap still bounds order size to limit extreme over-ordering and holding costs.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32 decision. Context: Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), so OR backend will target a high service quantile q = 0.5 (z* near 0) if fed baseline stats; however demand has shown a clear, sustained upward regime since Period_5 with very large recent levels (periods 5\u201331 all much higher than P1\u2013P4). Lead time: concluded history repeatedly shows arrivals in the same period they were ordered (many concluded messages stating lead_time was 0), so promised lead time remains accurate; I therefore use L = default (promised 0). Demand forecast: to reflect the sustained high-demand regime and to be responsive to the most recent behavior, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, averaging the most recent 20 demand samples (capped reasonable window to capture recent trend without overreacting to single spikes). N=20 balances responsiveness to the long-running high regime (Periods ~12\u201331 large volumes) while keeping enough data to estimate volatility. This choice gives the OR backend a demand forecast scaled for (1+L) periods that represents recent elevated demand and a volatility estimate based on the same recent window. With L=0 this pushes the backend to order to a base-stock approximating recent mean demand; that aligns service levels to current elevated demand while avoiding excessive overstock since holding cost equals profit. On-hand plus in-transit are both zero now, so the system will place orders up to the base-stock computed by the OR engine using these inputs.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (every concluded order from P1..P32 arrived same period), so I trust a zero lead time now. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since about Period_5 with a persistent upward level; the most recent periods (last ~20) best represent current demand volatility and mean. To capture the current high-demand regime while still smoothing short-term noise I choose recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 20 samples. Using 'calculate' for L (average observed lead times) confirms L=0. This setup biases orders to meet elevated recent demand (improving service and units_sold) while the backend's cap limits prevent runaway orders; given profit=holding, the backend's q=0.5 implies a moderate service target, so feeding it recent mean and std helps balance stockouts vs holding cost under the current sustained high-demand regime.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 across many periods (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 5 with a clear upward trend; the most recent 29-period average (P5\u2013P33) = 1877.31 units, well above earlier baselines. With lead time effectively zero and a long, sustained high-demand regime, I instruct the OR engine to use recent demand statistics so the base-stock covers the current high mean and volatility. I choose recent_N with N=20 (the policy rule: N = min(regime_length,20)) to capture the most recent 20 demand samples and adapt to the elevated mean/variance while avoiding overreacting to single-period spikes. L is left as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given very high demand) against holding cost by using a recent-window forecast rather than the much-smoothed all-sample mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 33: avg demand for Periods 5\u201333 = 1877.31, up from prior reported 1503.33 (+24.9%); sustained high demand across 29 periods (P5\u2013P33).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, profit= $1/unit vs holding=$1/unit/period (q=0.5 \u2192 target median-ish). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders from Period 1..34 arrived same period) so promised lead time appears accurate. Demand has shown a sustained, large upward regime beginning at Period 5 and continuing through Period 34 (recent periods show very high demand). With no inventory on hand or in transit, we must replenish to cover the ongoing high-demand regime. I choose L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time observed historically. For demand forecast I use recent_N on the most recent data to capture the elevated regime while avoiding dilution by much smaller early-period samples; I select N=20 (recent 20 periods provides a conservative, robust sample of the current high-demand regime while respecting the N cap). For sigma_hat I also choose recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago low-variance samples. These parameters will raise base_stock to cover the sustained higher mean and recent volatility so the OR backend orders enough to reduce lost sales while the cap limits extreme single-period ordering. This balances service level against holding cost given equal profit/holding values.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time = 0 and historical conclude messages (P1..P35) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period as order). Demand has a strong, sustained upward regime beginning around Period_5 and continuing through Period_35; recent periods (last ~20) show substantially higher demand than early history. Because inventory is zero and demand is high, I bias forecasts toward the recent high-demand regime to avoid stockouts. Choices: L='default' (use promised lead time 0 since concluded history confirms 0); mu_hat='recent_N' with N=20 to base the review+lead forecast on the most recent 20 demand observations (captures the sustained high-demand regime while smoothing local noise); sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters instruct the OR backend to target a base stock calibrated to recent high mean demand (increasing service level) while using the capped order size to limit excessive orders and control holding cost. This balances profit per unit = holding cost by leveraging recent demand evidence and the 0-period lead time to replenish within the same period.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 periods for all observed orders (arrivals recorded in same period as each order through Period 36). Demand has shown a sustained, large upward regime beginning around Period 5 and continuing through Period 36; recent periods (P17\u2013P36) remain consistently high. With lead time effectively 0, we must cover only the current period's demand after ordering (review+lead = 1 period). To reflect the sustained high-demand regime while limiting sensitivity to older low-demand samples (Periods 1\u20134), I set demand forecasts using a recent-window estimator. I choose recent_N with N=20 (backend rule: N = max(min(regime_length,20),3); the high-demand regime length since Period 5 is >20, so N=20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the last 20 demand samples. This keeps the base-stock tuned to current elevated demand while avoiding overreacting to very short blips. Using default lead time (promised 0) aligns with concluded evidence. These parameters steer the OR backend toward higher target inventory to improve service (profit per unit = holding cost per unit, so the backend's service quantile equals 0.5) while keeping variability measured from the recent high-demand window to avoid excessive holding cost from older low-demand history.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38 decision. Recent demand has been at a sustained elevated regime since Period_5 with strong upward trend; most recent concluded periods (P35\u2013P37) continue to show very high demand (P35=3490, P36=3748, P37=3643) and on-hand=0, in-transit=0 at decision time. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period repeatedly), so using promised/default lead time is supported. I choose L=default to keep lead time = promised (0). For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime while still giving weight to the most recent 20 concluded periods (reduces influence of the much smaller early-period samples). I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to characterize variability from the same recent window. These choices bias the OR backend's base-stock upward (higher mu_hat based on recent high mean) to avoid stockouts given zero observed lead time and very high recent demand, while using a 20-period sample to avoid overreacting to single-period spikes. With profit=holding, the backend's z will be 0.5, so raising mu_hat based on recent high demand increases expected units sold more than incremental holding costs in this high-demand regime.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 decision. Historical conclues (P1\u2013P38) consistently show actual lead time = 0 and a clear, sustained high-demand regime since Period 5 with steadily rising averages; recent realized demands (Periods 19\u201338) are very large relative to early periods. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no overdue or lost shipments). I choose L=default to trust the repeatedly confirmed 0-period lead time (many concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). For demand sizing I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 20 demand samples \u2014 this captures the sustained high, accelerating demand while limiting influence of much earlier low-demand periods. Using recent data increases target base_stock to avoid stockouts (high lost sales cost given equal profit and holding cost) while sigma_hat from recent volatility lets the backend set safety stock proportional to observed variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period across full history). Demand has been in a strong, sustained upward regime for many periods; most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 35\u201339) = [3490, 3748, 3643, 3371, 3792], recent average \u2248 3608.8. I choose L=default to reflect the promised lead time (0) because concluded history strongly confirms 0 actual lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to make the OR engine target the current high-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples \u2248 3609). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to let the backend capture recent volatility around this new demand level. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts in the current high-demand environment while the OR backend will compute the safety stock via profit/(profit+holding) service target; using recent data prevents the backend from being pulled down by much lower early-period samples.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (P1\u2013P40) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (every order arrived same period), so promised lead time remains valid. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 5 with a clear uptick beginning around Period 34; the most recent 7 periods (P34\u2013P40) show materially higher demand (3213,3490,3748,3643,3371,3792,4106) compared with the prior baseline. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms zero lead time. For demand sizing I use recent_N with N=7 (the length of the newly detected recent regime from P34\u2013P40) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 7 samples. This focuses the OR backend on the most recent elevated demand pattern, improving service (reducing lost sales) while avoiding overstating volatility from much older lower-demand periods. Given profit=holding, the backend will choose a z that balances service vs. holding; supplying accurate recent mean/variance helps keep orders aligned with the new demand level. I flagged no missing shipments or in-transit units to adjust for.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 40: avg demand for Periods 5\u201340 = 2216.80, up from prior reported 1877.31 (+18.2%); sustained high demand across 7 periods (P34\u2013P40).

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders placed arrive same period). Demand has followed a sustained, accelerating high-demand regime since Period 5 with the most recent 9 concluded-period demands (P33\u2013P41) averaging well above earlier windows. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded history shows 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (the most recent 9 concluded periods, Periods 33\u201341) to capture the current high regime while avoiding stale earlier low values. I apply the same recent_N=9 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the OR backend to set a base stock that covers the current elevated mean demand over the review+lead window and to size safety stock using recent volatility\u2014trading off holding cost versus large lost-sales risk given the strong, sustained upward demand.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Demand has shown a sustained, large upward regime since Period_5 and especially from Period_34 onward; recent concluded demands (Periods 34\u201342) are substantially higher than early samples. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must order to cover this elevated demand. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so estimate lead time from observed history. I select L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to confirm 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 34\u201342) to capture the current high-demand level and avoid dilution by much smaller early-period samples; regime length = 9 periods so N=9. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=9 captures recent volatility. These choices give the OR engine a mu_hat that scales (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand and sigma_hat that reflects recent variation; with profit=holding, the backend will choose a service level mid-range but my recent-based forecast ensures orders match the sustained high demand and prevents chronic stockouts while limiting excess holding costs given lead time = 0.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical conclude messages through Period 43 consistently show arrived=ordered with lead_time=0, so lead time remains 0. Demand has been in a sustained high, rising regime for many periods (carry-over history documents progressive increases). To balance service level vs holding cost now (profit=$1, holding=$1 so critical fractile q=0.5), I anchor demand forecast to the most recent demand behavior rather than the long-run series so the OR backend's base-stock will reflect current high demand but remain responsive to reductions. Therefore: L=default to use promised 0; mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the last 5 periods' elevated average demand (Periods 39\u201343) so the (1+L)\xd7mean reflects very recent demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps safety stock aligned to recent variability while avoiding over-weighting older low-demand periods. No indication of lost shipments (arrivals match orders historically), so no explicit lead-time inflation is needed.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 for many periods (every concluded order from P1..P44 shows arrived in same period). Demand has been in a sustained, elevated regime since Period 5 with continued growth through recent periods (many concluded periods P5..P44 show high/expanding demand). To capture the confirmed zero lead time I use a calculated lead time (average of observed lead times = 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent 20 periods of high-demand data (this reflects the long, sustained regime and gives the OR engine a recent mean). I also set sigma_hat using recent_N N=20 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices keep orders responsive to the current high-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock consistent with profit vs holding tradeoff. No overdue or lost shipments are observed (arrivals always concluded same period), so no explicit lead-time extension is needed.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. Context: confirmed same-period arrivals (actual lead time = 0 across many concluded periods) and a sustained, multi-period high-demand regime beginning at Period 5 and continuing through Period 45. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must order to cover immediate demand. Lead time decision: use the promised/default lead time (0) because concluded messages consistently show lead_time was 0. Demand forecasting: recent demand has risen substantially and stayed elevated for many periods; to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing noise I use a recent-window estimate. I choose recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 demand observations, respecting the guidance to use recent regime length and capping at 20). Volatility: use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent variability rather than outdated low-volume samples. How this balances service vs holding: profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so the backend will target roughly a 50% critical ratio; using recent demand samples keeps mu_hat aligned to current high demand (reducing stockouts) while recent sigma_hat informs safety stock\u2014using N=20 avoids overreacting to single-period spikes but responds to the sustained regime. Because on-hand + pipeline = 0, these parameters will prompt the OR engine to order towards a base stock suitable for current high demand while the cap prevents over-ordering from a single-period spike.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving same period (many samples with 'arrived = ordered on same Period'), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0 \u2014 use promised/default lead time. Demand has a clear, sustained high-demand regime since Period_5 and has continued to increase; to capture the most recent demand level and volatility I use a recent-window estimate. I select recent_N with N=20 (the backend rule: N = min(regime_length,20)) to bias forecasts toward the latest 20 periods of demand, so mu_hat reflects current high mean and sigma_hat captures recent variability. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the sustained elevated demand while the equal profit/holding costs (profit = holding) imply a moderate service-level target; using recent data reduces stockouts from underestimating today\u2019s demand while avoiding excessive holding from using the entire long-run series.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained, elevated upward regime for many periods (recent demands >> early samples). I therefore keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. For mu_hat I choose an EWMA to emphasize very recent very-high demands while still using the long history to stabilize the forecast (gamma=0.3 gives moderate weight to recent spikes). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current variability around the high-demand regime (last 5 realized demands are large and volatile); this helps the OR backend compute a higher safety stock appropriate to high, variable demand. These choices balance service level (avoid stockouts during strong demand) against holding cost by letting the backend compute base_stock from an EWMA mean and a recent volatility estimate while respecting the lead time = 0 environment.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 across all concluded periods. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 5 with accelerating averages; recent periods (especially Periods 29\u201348) show very large demands (single-period demand often 3000\u20134800). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), so the OR backend targets roughly the mean demand across the review+lead period (z* near 0). To capture the currently elevated demand regime and reduce stockouts, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes a base-stock reflecting the most recent 20 concluded demand samples. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0 lead time; no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Using recent_N (N=20) biases the forecast toward the latest high-demand behavior, increasing ordering to satisfy service while the OR engine's cap limits extreme orders. This balances the equal profit/holding tradeoff by matching expected demand closely and avoiding excessive holding from older low-demand history.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many periods show 'arrived ... lead_time was 0'), so use default promised lead time. Demand has been in a sustained, higher regime for many periods (large, persistent upward shift since Period 5 and particularly high in recent periods). To capture the recent high mean and volatility while avoiding overreaction to a single period, I use recent_N on both demand mean and std with N=20 (per rule: N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). This uses the last 20 demand samples to reflect the current regime for the (1+L) review+lead period mean (mu_hat) and recent volatility (sigma_hat). These parameters raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat captures variability so the OR backend can set safety stock\u2014balancing service (profit) vs holding cost.
