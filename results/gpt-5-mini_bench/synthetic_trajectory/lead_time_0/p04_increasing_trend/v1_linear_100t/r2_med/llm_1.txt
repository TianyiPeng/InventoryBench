Treat promised 0 as the working assumption but remain cautious since delayed/lost shipments are possible. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. To avoid immediate lost sales in Period 1 we need an order that can arrive this period if lead_time=0. e) Final order logic: target meeting expected Period_1 demand (~107) plus a small safety buffer to cover variance. Holding cost is $1/unit/period versus profit $4/unit, so modest overstock is acceptable. Therefore place an order of 120 units to service expected demand while limiting ending inventory risk.",

This suggests true demand could be well above the 120 we stocked. c) Lead time & arrivals: Period_1 conclude states ordered=120 arrived=120 (ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 0 periods). That confirms same-period arrival for the supplier in at least Period_1. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. With confirmed lead_time=0, orders placed now will arrive in this same period and can satisfy Period_2 demand (arrival occurs after decision but before demand). e) Forecast & order logic: Given the upward trend in the provided historical samples and the Period_1 stockout (demand exceeded 120), I target expected Period_2 demand near the sample value ~252 while balancing holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs. profit ($4/unit). Each additional unit sold yields net +$4 but unsold units cost $1 per period; it's preferable to avoid a stockout because foregone sales lose significant profit.

The short-run trend is modestly upward. The separate historical sample in the game description is not part of the concluded history stream I can act on; I rely on the two concluded periods. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Concluded arrivals show orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 had lead_time=0 (both arrived same period). That is consistent evidence but only two periods of confirmation\u2014this is encouraging but not yet a 3+ period sustained change per carry-over rules. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 84, in-transit = 0. With lead_time observed=0 in both previous periods, an order now would likely arrive in-period and be available for Period 3 demand. e) Final order logic: Profit per unit sold = $4; holding cost per unit per period = $1. The marginal expected value of meeting extra demand is high (sell yields +$4, leftover costs only $1 next period). Forecast for Period 3 demand around 165\u2013180 based on recent actuals (166 last period, 146 prior). To avoid a costly stockout (lost sales at $4 profit each), I target coverage near the upper side of that range.

This should cover expected demand under continued strong growth while keeping potential end-of-period holding cost moderate.",
