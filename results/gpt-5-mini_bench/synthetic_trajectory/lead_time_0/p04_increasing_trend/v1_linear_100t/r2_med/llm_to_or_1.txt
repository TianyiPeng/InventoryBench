Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a clear upward regime: 107, 252, 298, 376, 544 (recent growth is large). No 'Period conclude' messages available to infer actual lead time, so I retain the promised lead time (default). Because demand has shifted upward and the last three periods are consistently higher, I use recent_N=3 for the demand forecast (mu_hat) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 3 samples (298, 376, 544 \u2192 mean=406). I also use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat so the engine uses recent volatility. This raises the base-stock and safety stock to meet the higher demand while the high profit-to-holding ratio (profit $4 vs holding $1) implies a high service-level target; using recent data focuses inventory where demand currently is and avoids under-ordering in a rising-demand regime. I will watch for concluded arrivals in future periods to revise lead-time if shipments are delayed or lost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: avg increased from ~179.5 (Periods 1-2) to 406 (Periods 3-5), +126%; sustained for 3 periods

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. Current on-hand=366, in-transit=0. Last period (Period_1) concluded that a 512-unit order placed in Period_1 arrived the same period (observed lead_time=0). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean \u2248315.4 units and std \u2248144.0 units; there is a previously recorded carry-over insight noting a demand regime shift at Period 3 (not new this period). Given the confirmed 0-period actual lead time from Period_1 conclude and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments, I use the default lead time (promised L=0) so the OR backend's pipeline assumptions align with observed arrivals. I also select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample history (mu_hat \u2248315.4, sigma_hat \u2248144.0 with L=0). This keeps the base-stock target responsive to the full historical demand profile while avoiding premature overreaction to short-term noise; it also leverages the OR engine's capped ordering rule to limit order sizes relative to demand volatility and lead time.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 context: recent confirmed demand regime shift to a higher mean (Periods 3-5 avg \u2248 406). Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals for Periods 1-2 show actual lead_time = 0, so I keep L at the promised/default. Inventory reconciliation: on-hand = 256, in-transit = 0, but expected single-period demand under the new regime \u2248 406, so on-hand is insufficient and we should replenish aggressively. Parameter choices: L = default (use promised 0) because concluded history shows 0-period actual lead time; mu_hat = recent_N with N=3 to target the new higher-demand regime (uses mean of Periods 3-5 \u2192 ~406 for the (1+L) review+lead window); sigma_hat = recent_N with N=3 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These settings push the OR backend to raise the base-stock toward the new demand level (improving service and profit capture) while sigma_hat lets the backend size safety stock to balance holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1365.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Context: recent sustained demand regime shift beginning Period_3 \u2014 recent mean demand (Periods 3\u20135) \u2248 406 units/period (298, 376, 544). On-hand = 107, in-transit = 0, promised lead time = 0 and concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 for prior orders. With profit $4 and holding $1 the critical fractile is high (q=0.8) so we should size base-stock to cover the new, higher regime rather than the long-run average. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N=3 to capture the confirmed regime (Periods 3\u20135). For volatility I also use recent_N=3 to reflect recent variability. This raises target base-stock to meet service under the new higher mean; it also avoids overreacting to older low-demand periods. Given on-hand 107 and no pipeline, the OR engine will place an order to top up toward the base-stock computed from these recent estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1324.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 5. chips(Regular) has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P4 concluded with lead_time=0). Demand history shows a sustained upward regime starting Period 3 (Periods 3\u20135: 298, 376, 544) \u2014 a higher-demand regime of 3 periods. No shipments are overdue or lost in the concluded history. Given the confirmed demand uplift beginning Period 3, I set lead time by calculating the observed average (to reflect real observed behavior) and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent regime samples only so the OR engine builds safety stock to cover the higher demand. Specifically: L set with method "calculate" to use the average of observed lead times (which are all 0 in concluded history). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=3 (Periods 3\u20135) so (1+L)*mean reflects the newer, higher mean demand and prevents underordering from an older, lower mean. sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to reflect the higher variability in the recent regime, which increases the base-stock z\xb7\u03c3 term and the cap, improving service given profit/holding tradeoff (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high target fill rate). This combination helps the backend raise target inventory to meet the confirmed higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind by using only the new regime data rather than the low pre-shift samples.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision context: observed sustained demand increase starting at Period_3 (Periods 3-5 high). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed in P1-P5 arrived same period). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so no pipeline coverage for upcoming demand; must cover current period demand since arrivals occur same period (promised L=0). Historical samples: P1-5 = [107,252,298,376,544]; recent regime (Periods 3-5) shows higher mean. I choose L=default to reflect promised lead time of 0 (concluded data confirms 0), ensuring OR backend uses same-period replenishment. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 3-5) because changepoint evidence (sustained increase for 3 periods) indicates a new higher-demand regime; N=3 is regime_length and meets the N selection rule. Using recent demand focuses base-stock on the elevated demand trend and avoids being pulled down by earlier low demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices push the OR engine to raise base stock and safety stock to meet higher demand while the capped ordering rule will limit over-ordering; this balances the $4 profit per unit against $1 holding cost by targeting service for the confirmed higher-demand regime rather than the long-run mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1972.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 decision. Recent concluded history shows consistently higher demand since Period_3 (concluded demands: P3=368, P4=426, P5=507, P6=636) and no outstanding in-transit or on-hand inventory (0 on-hand, 0 in-transit). All observed lead times in concludes have been 0, so I will use the promised/default lead time. I detect a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period_3; to capture the current regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (Periods 3-6) so the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect the elevated demand and its variability. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock focused on the current higher mean while using recent volatility to size safety stock; with profit=$4 and holding=$1 the backend will compute a z* that balances service level against holding cost. Using recent data avoids diluting the forecast with earlier low-demand periods and ensures orders cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon given current zero inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2328.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 decision. Recent demand has stepped up starting Period_3 and the last 5 periods (P3\u2013P7) show a consistently higher regime: demands = 368, 426, 507, 636, 618. On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we currently have no coverage vs. upcoming demand. All concluded periods (P1\u2013P7) show arrivals with lead_time=0, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I set lead time to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 0), and I base demand forecasts on the most recent high-demand regime using the last 5 samples (the sustained changepoint from P3 onward). I choose N=5 because the post-changepoint regime length is 5 (Periods 3\u20137) which captures the new mean/variance without diluting with the pre-shift low values. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute base_stock and cap using the current higher mean and volatility, which balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff and avoids underordering given zero inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in every concluded period (orders placed P1\u2013P8 all arrived with lead_time=0). Demand samples show a sustained upward regime beginning at Period 3: Periods 3\u20138 demands = 368,426,507,636,618,775 (6 periods) \u2014 materially higher than Periods 1\u20132. Given the sustained higher demand since Period 3, I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0 lead time. For demand size and variability I use recent_N over the last 6 periods (the detected regime from Period 3\u20138) so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 6 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 6 samples). Choosing recent_N with N=6 captures the elevated demand regime and recent volatility, ensuring the base-stock target increases to meet higher service-level needs while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods. This balances the profit-driven service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost: using recent data raises the target to reduce stockouts under the new regime, while sigma based on the same window avoids overstating uncertainty from earlier low-demand periods. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift is present in concluded history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2728.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period 10. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u20139) show actual lead_time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 and has trended up further through Period 9 (recent demands: P3=368, P4=426, P5=507, P6=636, P7=618, P8=775, P9=831). I therefore keep L at 'default' (use promised lead time=0). For demand sizing I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 3\u20139) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 7 samples) reflecting current elevated mean. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=7 so sigma_hat reflects recent variability, which is substantial due to the upward trend. These choices make the OR backend target a higher base-stock (to avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) while using recent sample variance to avoid excessive safety stock beyond observed variability. Since on-hand and pipeline are zero, this will prompt replenishment sized to the recent high-demand regime.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime that began at Period 3. Demands in Periods 6-10 are especially high (636,618,775,831,993) \u2014 on-hand and in-transit are both 0, so we must replenish to cover current + lead-time demand. All concluded arrivals so far show actual lead_time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so use calculate to let backend confirm average observed lead time is 0. For demand forecast, use a recent_N estimate to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime rather than diluting with early low periods. I choose N=8 (Periods 3\u201310 regime length = 8) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 8 demand samples, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 8 samples. This increases target base stock to reduce stockouts given observed sustained high demand, while the OR backend will cap orders to limit excessive holding cost. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time degradation \u2014 arrivals have been consistent at lead_time 0.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 context: recent periods (P3\u2013P11) show a sustained higher demand regime versus P1\u2013P2. All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 historically (every concluded order had lead_time 0). Current stock: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must restock to cover upcoming demand. Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1 so target service level q = 4/(4+1)=0.8; backend will convert this into z* for the base-stock. I choose to explicitly infer lead time from observed conclusions using 'calculate' (average observed lead time = 0) rather than trusting only the promise because concluded history supports it. For demand forecasting I detect a changepoint at Period 3 (sustained higher demand from P3 onward); I therefore use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime (Periods 3\u201311, length 9) so N=9. This focuses the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations on the recent high-demand regime rather than diluting them with the low initial two periods. With L=0 the backend will compute mu_hat = 1\xd7mean(last 9 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1)\xd7std(last 9), producing a base-stock aligned to the higher-demand regime and an order cap reflecting shorter lead time. This balances higher service level (to capture profit from high demand) against holding cost by basing safety stock on recent volatility rather than the full-history lower-mean dataset. Because on-hand+pipeline=0, the backend\u2019s order will aim to replenish up to the base-stock for the high-demand regime immediately.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (P1\u2013P12) show a clear upward trend with especially large growth in the most recent periods (P8\u2013P12). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in each conclude arrived same period), matching the promised lead time; no evidence of lost shipments. Because demand has accelerated recently, I bias the demand forecast toward the most recent regime rather than the long-run mean. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages consistently show lead_time = 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 concluded demand periods) to capture the recent higher mean and volatility; N=5 is chosen because the most recent regime (roughly P8\u2013P12) displays sustained elevated demand for >=3 periods and a regime length of about 5 periods. These parameters give the OR backend a base-stock aligned with current high demand while keeping holding exposure limited (promised L=0 keeps (1+L) small). This prioritizes serving current high demand (profit $4 > holding $1) while capturing recent volatility for safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4684.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: recent history shows a persistent, sustained demand regime shift that began at Period 3 and has continued through Period 13 (high demands well above early-period levels). On-hand = 16, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is negligible vs. current demand; there are no overdue or missing arrivals (all concluded lead times = 0 historically). Promised lead time remains valid and observed actual lead time is consistently 0, so I keep L = default to let the backend use promised lead time. Because demand clearly shifted upward and has been sustained for many periods, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-change regime. I choose N = 11 (covering Periods 3\u201313, the sustained high-demand regime) to capture the new mean and volatility while satisfying the recent_N rules (N between 3 and 20 and equals the regime length). These parameters will raise the base-stock to meet the higher realized demand while sigma_hat based on recent volatility moderates safety stock to balance service level with the $1 holding cost. This approach addresses missing inventory risk (current on-hand low, no in-transit) by ensuring orders target the new higher demand regime rather than diluted long-run averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4264.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_15. Recent demand context: sustained high-demand regime since Period_3 with rapidly increasing volumes through Period_14 (latest demands range ~618\u20131417, recent periods predominantly >600). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 \u2014 no incoming inventory visible, so we must forecast for (1+L) periods of demand before arrivals. Observed concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods, so I use the default promised lead time to avoid introducing extra delay. For demand forecasting I detect the most recent sustained high-demand regime starting at Period_3 and use a recent-N estimate so the forecast reflects the higher, sustained demand instead of long-run mixed history. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=12 (Periods 3\u201314) to capture the current regime average across the review+lead window. I apply sigma_hat as recent_N with the same N=12 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. This increases the base-stock to meet elevated demand and reduces stockouts (improving profit), while using recent volatility keeps safety stock from being excessively large (controlling holding cost).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 (sustained through Period 15). To capture the sustained higher mean and higher variability, I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0). For demand moments I use recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (Periods 3\u201315) so the OR backend computes base_stock from a forecast that reflects the sustained elevated demand and its volatility; this raises service level to capture sales while the capped order cap will limit extreme over-ordering and control holding cost. I choose N=13 (Period 3 through Period 15 inclusive) because the changepoint at Period 3 is sustained and regime length=13, which meets the recent_N selection rule.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded history (Periods 1-16) shows arrivals with observed lead_time=0 every time, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 3 (much larger demands from P3\u2013P16). With no pipeline and zero on-hand we must replenish to cover current and future high demand. I set L using 'calculate' to let the backend confirm lead_time=0 from observed concludes. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 3\u201316) because the changepoint at Period 3 created a sustained high-demand regime; N=14 captures the full post-changepoint history to produce a stable estimate. This raises the base-stock to match the new demand level while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability. These choices ensure the OR engine targets service levels appropriate for the higher demand while the capped order prevents extreme single-period orders and balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically (every concluded message lists lead_time 0). On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so there are no outstanding shipments or delayed arrivals to reconcile. Demand has been on a higher sustained regime since Period_3 (already recorded in carry-over insights). Recent realized demand levels (Periods 13-17) are high and fairly consistent (1175, 1417, 1436, 1578, 1586); to keep service and avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost, I use a recent-window demand estimate so the OR backend centers base stock on the current high regime. Therefore: L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (captures Periods 13-17). This balances profit-driven service level (profit/hc -> higher critical fractile) with holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the safety stock from recent mean and std rather than diluting it with older, lower-demand samples.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order from Period 1\u201318 arrived with lead_time 0). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 entering Period 19, so we must replenish to meet continuing elevated demand. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 (previous carry-over insight). Recent periods (Period 14\u201318) show strong elevated demand (1417, 1436, 1578, 1586, 1862), so I bias the forecast toward the most recent regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0 lead time. For mu_hat I choose recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (uses mean of last 5 observed demands, scaled by 1+L). For sigma_hat I also choose recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise base-stock to cover the new sustained higher demand while keeping holding exposure limited by using only the most recent regime for mean and variability rather than the long-run lower-demand history.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_20: All concluded history (Periods 1-19) shows actual lead time consistently 0 (every conclude states lead_time was 0). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 entering Period 20, so we must order to cover upcoming demand. Demand has a sustained higher-regime since Period 3 (earlier carry-over noted) and recent demands (Periods 3-19) are substantially larger than Periods 1-2. To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the most recent regime length (~17 periods from Period 3 to Period 19) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using the last 17 samples \u2014 this adapts to the sustained elevated demand while avoiding dilution by the small early low-demand samples. For L I use the default (promised lead time) because concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 across many periods (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). These choices raise the base-stock to meet much larger expected demand while sigma_hat (recent_N) increases safety stock to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff and reduce stockouts without excessive long-term holding.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 3 (confirmed earlier) \u2014 demand from Periods 3\u201320 is materially larger than Periods 1\u20132. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 (no overdue or arriving shipments visible). Promised lead time = 0 and historical concludes consistently show lead_time=0, so keep L as default. To capture elevated recent demand and avoid under-ordering, set mu_hat using recent demand: use recent_N over the most recent sustained regime (Periods 3\u201320, length 18) so the forecast reflects the higher mean. Use the same recent_N for sigma_hat to represent recent volatility rather than diluting with early low-demand periods. This increases service level to avoid lost sales while still constraining excess stock because L=default keeps the review window short; the OR backend will translate these into a base-stock balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Recent history shows a persistent high-demand regime starting at Period 3 (sustained through Period 21). All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 historically (every concluded order arrived same period). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must order to cover the elevated regime. I set L to default (promised lead time 0) because concluded messages consistently show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 3\u201321) to anchor forecasts on the sustained high-demand regime rather than the low early samples; this yields mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 19 samples, which matches current demand level. For volatility I also use recent_N N=19 so safety stock reflects observed variability in the high regime. These choices prioritize meeting high service levels (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding inflation of demand by very old low-demand periods. With L=0 the backend orders same-period arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent high-demand regime balance higher target stock vs holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: recent observed demand has been in a higher regime since Period_3 and remained elevated through Period_22 (sustained for 20 periods). Profit per unit = $4, holding = $1, so target service quantile q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 (backend uses this to set z). Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to meet upcoming demand. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (every concluded order had lead_time 0), so I will trust the promised lead time and keep L as default (0). For demand forecasting I choose a recent_N approach using the last sustained high-demand regime (Periods 3\u201322), which is 20 periods long; per the rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) = 20. This lets the OR engine compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 20 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 20 samples), capturing the sustained higher mean and volatility rather than diluting with the tiny pre-shift samples. These parameters bias orders toward higher stocking to avoid lost sales in the now-permanent higher-demand regime while the backend's cap prevents excessively large single orders. No overdue shipments or lost arrivals are observed in concluded history, so no explicit lead-time extension is needed.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Profit $4, holding $1 -> service fill is relatively more valuable (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8) so target fill is high. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded history (Periods 1\u201323) shows arrivals occurring same period (lead_time observed=0 each concluded message). No recently missing shipments to suggest longer or variable lead time. The provided historical demand samples (seeded earlier) show a clear upward demand regime that was already recorded in carry-over; no new sustained changepoint since then. Given zero on-hand and zero pipeline, I rely on the backend defaults so the OR engine will compute base stock from the full-sample mean/variance (this keeps forecasts stable and lets the OR cap manage order sizing). Using default L ensures we honor the promised lead time (0) because concluded messages confirm that. Default mu_hat/sigma_hat let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all available samples; this balances filling high demand with holding cost using the backend's q-derived z*. If lead time or demand regime evidence appears in future concluded messages (delays or sustained shifts), I will switch to a recent_N or explicit method then.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201324) show lead_time = 0, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Recent demand is high and trending upward: last 5 concluded period demands (Periods 20\u201324) = [2032, 2126, 2270, 2186, 2504], recent average \u2248 2223. To keep service high while controlling holding cost, I use a short recent-window forecast so the OR engine's base-stock reacts to the latest elevated demand. Therefore: L uses the default (promised) lead time = 0. mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand level across the review+lead period. sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings ensure the OR engine computes base_stock based on the latest high-demand regime while the capped ordering will limit excessively large orders, balancing profit ($4) against holding cost ($1).

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201325) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time 0). Demand underwent a sustained upshift at Period 3 and the high-demand regime has persisted through Period 25. Recent demands (Periods 21\u201325 = 2126, 2270, 2186, 2504, 2479) show a high, volatile level; I therefore anchor the forecast to this most recent window to reflect current demand rather than dilute it with much lower early-period values. Lead time: use default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms actual 0. Mu_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to set (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 observed demands, capturing the current elevated regime and keeping the base-stock responsive to recent increases. Sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility (so safety stock scales to current variability). These choices balance service (profit=$4/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) by focusing replenishment on the confirmed high-demand regime while using only a short recent window to avoid overstating long-term variance and minimizing excess holding cost given on-hand=0 and no in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistently zero observed lead time (orders placed arrived same period) and demand has been in a higher regime since Period_3 (sustained for many periods). Current objective: ensure the OR backend targets the higher post-changepoint demand while avoiding unnecessary extra inventory. I set L="default" to use the promised lead time (concludes confirm lead time=0 historically). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 3\u201326 are the relevant regime; cap N at 20 per rules). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent, stable regime samples so base-stock reflects the elevated demand and observed variability. This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) by increasing target stock to meet higher demand while keeping variability-driven safety stock grounded in recent volatility rather than older low-demand data.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: all concluded lead times so far are 0 (orders placed arrived same period), on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand is much higher than the early-sample baseline (sustained higher regime since Period_3). No overdue or missing shipments to account for, so use promised lead time. To keep the OR engine responsive to the current high-demand regime, I use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility, focused on the most recent 5 periods (Periods 23-27) to reflect current demand levels while staying above the minimum N=3. Using recent_N (N=5) raises base_stock to cover the modern demand regime and keeps safety stock calibrated to recent volatility; keeping L as default (promised 0) avoids inflating pipeline coverage since no evidence of lead-time drift. This balances service (avoid lost sales given zero on-hand) against holding cost by anchoring forecasts to the latest realized demand.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: recent demand is very high and sustained. Last 5 concluded demands (Periods 24-28) = [2504, 2479, 2457, 2508, 2890], average \u2248 2568 \u2014 well above the long-run mean seeded by earlier low periods. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must order to cover the current high-demand regime plus the review+lead period. All concluded lead-time observations have been 0 periods, so I use the promised/default lead time. I choose mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor the base-stock to the most recent high-demand regime (N=5 chosen because of a clear sustained high-demand run over the last 5 periods; N obeys the rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). I also choose sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect the volatility observed in the same recent window. These settings push the OR engine to target inventory suitable for the new higher demand while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent variability, balancing the $4 profit per unit against the $1 holding cost.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 every observed period (orders from Period 1\u201329 arrived in same period), so promised lead time=0 remains appropriate. Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime since Period_3 (carry-over insight already recorded). Recent demand is much higher than early periods; to make the backend responsive to the current high-demand regime I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 concluded demand observations (Periods 25\u201329) so the (1+L)-scaled forecast and volatility reflect current demand intensity and variability. This avoids being understocked by relying on long-ago low-demand samples while still using L=default to match observed zero lead time. These parameters prioritize service (higher mu_hat) where profit ($4) outweighs holding cost ($1) but keep sigma estimated from recent variability to avoid excessive safety stock.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders from Period 1\u201330 all arrived same period), so promised lead time is reliable. Demand has been in a sustained, higher regime since Period_3 (earlier carry-over noted) and recent periods (Periods 11\u201330) show large, growing demands \u2014 I therefore use a recent-sample forecast to capture the current elevated mean and volatility. L set to default (promised lead time = 0). mu_hat set to recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 20 demand observations, which captures the sustained high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand variability for safety-stock sizing. This increases base_stock and the cap appropriately so the OR backend balances high lost-sales cost (profit=$4) against holding cost ($1), prioritizing service in the current high-demand regime while using recent data to avoid overstating long-term variance.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (every conclude shows arrived with lead_time=0). Demand has shown a sustained higher regime since Period_3 and has trended upward; recent periods (Periods 12\u201331) exhibit large absolute demand levels. Given zero pipeline and no late shipments visible, we need the OR engine to target the recent high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because all concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the sustained high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise). For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent variability. Rationale vs. costs: profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high target service level (q\u22480.8 \u2192 z\u22480.84). By using recent 20-period statistics the backend will compute a base-stock that protects availability during high demand while sigma based on recent variability tempers overstock; this balances maximizing profit from sales against holding cost in each period. Because there are no in-transit units, the backend will be able to place orders to fulfill the elevated recent demand profile immediately.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33 decision. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover upcoming demand. Historical conclude messages show all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 (orders placed arrived same period) \u2014 no evidence of delayed or lost shipments, so I keep L at the promised/default. Demand sustained at a much higher level since Period_3; to capture the current high-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the most recent 20 periods (capped at 20) to reflect the current regime while smoothing short-term noise. This raises target base stock to better meet demand and avoids under-ordering; using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures safety stock reflects recent volatility rather than older low-demand periods. These choices balance service (profit per unit = $4) against holding cost ($1) by focusing on recent realized demand and volatility rather than long-ago low-volume history.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages through Period_33 show every order arrived same-period (observed lead_time=0 consistently), so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Demand has moved to a higher regime (previous carry-over noted a sustained shift starting Period_3). Recent demand remains elevated and volatile; the last 5 realized demands (Periods 29-33) average \u22483122 units, reflecting the current regime. To keep service high while avoiding excessive holding cost, I use a short recent-window forecast so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current elevated demand and recent volatility. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concludes consistently show 0 lead time. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand level (1+L times mean of last 5 periods). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=5 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These parameters provide the OR backend with an updated base-stock reflecting current demand spikes while L=default trusts the observed prompt arrivals, balancing profit per unit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 periods consistently (many 'arrived' messages with lead_time 0), so I use the default promised lead time. Demand has risen and remained high for many periods: recent concluded demands (Periods 30-34) = [3004, 3152, 3151, 3344, 3383], average \u2248 3207. With profit=$4 and holding=$1, the backend will target a high service level (q = 4/(4+1)=0.8) so we should size base-stock to the recent demand regime to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost in check. Because early-period low-demand samples would depress a long-run mean, I anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent stable regime (last 5 periods) so the OR engine's forecast and cap reflect current elevated demand and recent volatility. Using L=default (promised lead time=0) ensures order arrivals are expected same-period per supplier promise and aligns with observed concluded lead times. This choice balances service (avoid lost sales during sustained high demand) against holding costs by letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent mean and std.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36 start. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period_3 (sustained growth through Period_35). Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of high demand. All concluded history (Periods 1\u201335) shows every order arrived with lead_time = 0 periods, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. I choose L via "calculate" so the backend uses the observed lead-time average (which is 0). For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat: the changepoint at Period_3 created a new, sustained high-demand regime and the most relevant information is the most recent data; per the rules N = min(regime_length,20) with regime_length >>20 so N=20. Using recent_N concentrates the forecast on the current high-demand regime and reduces the influence of the low-demand early samples. This raises the base_stock to cover the larger mean and the recent variability, helping the OR engine balance the high profit ($4) versus $1 holding cost by sizing safety stock around recent volatility rather than older low-demand noise. No overdue arrivals are observed (in-transit=0), so no special explicit lead-time penalty is needed.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. Recent history shows consistently observed lead_time = 0 for all concluded orders (every concluded period reports arrived units with lead_time 0). Demand has been in a higher regime for many periods (sustained high demand since Period 3). Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0 so there are no arrivals pending or overdue. Therefore I choose to set L using observed lead times (calculate) to confirm the consistent 0 lead time. For demand forecast I use the default methods so the OR backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample set (default = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). Using defaults with L=0 leverages all historical demand information and the long-standing higher-demand regime; this balances service level (profit/hard stockouts) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. No special explicit uplift is needed because lead time is stable and demand regime has been captured in historical samples.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period), so no evidence of increased lead time or lost shipments. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period_3 (carry-over insight already recorded). To ensure the OR backend stocks for the current high-demand regime while controlling holding costs, I use the most recent data window to estimate demand across the review+lead period. I select L=default to trust the promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (the most recent regime length capped at 20) so the base-stock and cap reflect current high mean and volatility observed in recent periods. This balances service level (by reacting to higher recent mean demand) against holding cost (by using a recent window rather than all-time history). No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and concluded history consistently shows arrivals with lead_time=0 for every observed concluded order \u2014 no evidence of delayed or lost shipments, so keep L at promised (default). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 (previous carry-over insight). Recent demand continues elevated and volatile; I use a recent-window forecast to capture current level and variability. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the last five demand observations (Periods 34-38) so the OR backend base-stock reflects the current higher mean (~3.67k) and recent variance. This keeps service high (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding over-weighting older, much lower-demand history. Using default L and recent demand stats helps the OR engine compute base_stock = mu_hat + z*\xb7sigma_hat for the current regime, with the capped order preventing extreme single-period replenishment.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 in every concluded period (Period 1\u201339), and demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 (sustained). No overdue or missing arrivals are visible in the conclude history. Given the sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 3, I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent high-demand behavior (recent 20-period average over the post-changepoint regime), which helps the backend set a base-stock that covers the (1+L) review+lead window under current elevated demand. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 so safety stock reflects recent volatility rather than older low-demand variability. These choices aim to raise the order target to reduce stockouts under the new regime while keeping holding costs moderated by using the 20 most recent observations rather than all historical data.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201340) consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0 (every concluded arrival states lead_time was 0), so actual lead time is confirmed at 0. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period_3 and remained elevated and fairly variable through Period_40. Given high profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) (service-fill quantile q = 4/(4+1)=0.8), I want the OR engine to target a relatively high base-stock that reflects the recent high-demand regime. Therefore: set L using calculate to capture the confirmed 0-period lead time from concluded history; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to base the forecast on the most recent 20 periods (captures the sustained high-demand regime and recent variability). This approach balances a high service level (reduce stockouts given high profit) while keeping holding costs in check by using recent demand statistics rather than the entire long history.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 (sustained). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, and historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). No overdue or lost shipments evident. I choose L = default to trust the promised lead time of 0 because concluded history consistently confirms 0-period actual lead times. For demand forecasting I detect the sustained high-demand regime from Period 3 onward (current regime length ~39 periods). To capture the most relevant recent behavior while smoothing older noise, I use recent_N with N = 20 (N = min(regime_length,20), >=3). With L=0, mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean of last 20 demand samples and sigma_hat will use sqrt(1+L)*std of last 20 samples. This focuses the OR backend on recent high demand to keep service levels high while the capped ordering limit will constrain extreme orders and help control holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and every concluded arrival in history shows lead_time=0 (orders consistently arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime for many periods (large, stable volumes since Period 3 onward). To avoid stockouts immediately (current on-hand=0) and because recent periods show the current high-demand regime persists, I set L to default (use promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing shorter noise; this biases mu_hat toward recent observed high demand so the OR backend's base-stock will protect service level. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility rather than dilute it with very old, lower-demand samples. These choices push the OR engine to hold more stock (higher mu_hat and sigma_hat) to balance the high lost-sales cost (profit $4) against holding cost $1. Because on-hand + pipeline = 0, this will trigger an immediate replenishment sized by the backend's capped-policy using the recent high-demand estimates.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 while recent demand has been high and sustained (samples from Period_3 onward show a permanently higher regime). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders from Periods 1-43 all arrived with lead_time=0), so I trust the promised lead time. Because demand shifted up at Period_3 and has remained elevated, I bias the demand estimate toward the most recent data: use recent_N (N=20) to capture the latest regime (reduces influence of much smaller early samples). I also use recent_N (N=20) for sigma to reflect current volatility. Using L=default (promised 0) ensures the OR engine treats arrivals as same-period; recent_N for mu_hat ensures the base-stock targets current high-demand levels and avoids chronic understocking given zero on-hand/pipeline. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift, so no explicit lead-time inflation is applied.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 for every concluded order (Period 1\u201344 conclude messages all report lead_time=0), so promised lead time remains accurate and reliable. Demand has been in a sustained high regime well above the early-period levels for many periods (recent demands ~3.3k\u20134.4k). To ensure the OR backend targets the current high-demand regime and avoids understocking, I use recent demand statistics rather than the full-sample mean that would be diluted by very low early periods. I select recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior (roughly the last ~20 periods) which balances responsiveness to the high-demand regime while using a sample size large enough to smooth short-term noise. L is left as default (promised lead time = 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 with no evidence of delays or lost shipments. These choices instruct the OR engine to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 20 demand samples, which increases the base-stock to match current demand and set safety stock consistent with recent volatility\u2014improving service (units sold \xd7 profit) while accepting only necessary holding cost given 0 promised lead time.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period (orders arriving same period), so promised lead time remains consistent. Demand has been on a higher sustained regime since Period_3 (carry-over insight already recorded) and recent periods (Periods ~26-45) show elevated, rising demand. To prioritize service (profit $4 vs holding $1 => high target service level) while keeping the OR engine responsive to the most recent demand level, I use default lead time (promised=0) and set demand forecasts from the most recent 20 periods to capture the current high-demand regime without over-weighting very old low-demand history. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 captures recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher base-stock (reducing missed sales) while relying on the backend cap to limit extreme orders and control holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16388.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order lists lead_time 0), so promised lead time is reliable. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period_3 (noted previously). Recent demands (Periods 42-46) = [4099, 4417, 4470, 4605, 4638], showing the current elevated level. To keep service while avoiding excessive holding cost, I use a recent-window forecast so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest demand regime rather than older low-demand samples. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current average demand (~4445 units for a single-period review+lead). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so safety stock sizing reflects recent volatility. This balances profit-driven service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by allowing the OR engine to compute z* from cost ratio while basing demand statistics on the most relevant recent data. No overdue shipments or lost arrivals are observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $18508.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48 decision: all visible concludes (Periods 1\u201347) show actual lead time = 0 (every concluded arrival states lead_time was 0). Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must replenish for Period 48 demand plus safety. Historical demand shows a sustained, higher-demand regime beginning at Period 3 and continuing through Period 47. I will use the promised/default lead time (L = default = 0) because concludes consistently confirm 0 lead time. For demand estimate I use a recent_N approach focused on the most recent regime: changepoint evidence is the previously recorded shift at Period 3 with a long, stable high-demand regime since then; to capture recent variability and the current level I choose N = 20 (the backend rule: N = min(regime_length,20) with regime_length >> 20, and floor \u22653). Thus mu_hat uses recent_N with N=20 to reflect (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 20 observed demands, and sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices give the OR engine a forecast anchored to the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability. Given profit = $4 and holding = $1, the backend will translate these into a base-stock balancing service level vs holding cost; using recent demand stats will avoid systematic under- or over-stocking from stale long-run averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $17268.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we have no inventory to meet Period_49 demand that will occur after this decision. Promised lead time is 0 and the conclude history shows consistent actual lead_time=0 for many periods (orders ordered and arrived same period), so using the default promised lead time is reasonable. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher, sustained regime (carry-over already recorded: shift at Period 3). Recent periods (roughly Periods ~29-48) show consistently high demand that the backend's all-sample mean would dilute; to ensure the OR engine targets adequate service and avoids stockouts I select recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest high-demand regime. I choose N=20 to capture the most recent ~20 periods of demand (long enough to smooth noise but focused on current regime). With L=default and mu_hat/sigma_hat computed from the last 20 samples, the backend will compute a base-stock that raises the order-up-to to cover the current high-demand environment while the recent_N sigma helps set safety stock reflecting recent variability. This balances the high profit ($4) relative to holding cost ($1) by biasing toward service (higher q) while using recent variability to avoid excessive safety stock.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_50. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (every concluded order arrived same period it was ordered). Demand has been in a higher sustained regime for many periods (large growth from early periods and sustained high demands through Period 49). To give the OR engine a demand forecast that reflects the sustained high-demand regime, I use a recent_N forecast over the most recent 20 periods to capture the current mean and volatility while keeping lead time at the promised/default value (0). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat helps the backend set a base-stock appropriate to the elevated demand, while default L avoids overestimating lead time since concluded evidence shows lead_time=0. This aims to maximize units sold (profit $4) while controlling holding cost ($1) by using a demand estimate anchored to the most recent 20-period regime.
