Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no conclude messages available so no evidence to change promised lead time. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean = 315.4 units and sample std \u2248 161.04 units. Promised lead time is used (L default). I choose default methods so the OR engine will compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) = 315.4 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2248 161.04. With Profit = Holding = $1, critical ratio q = 0.5 (z* = 0), so the backend will target roughly the demand mean; using defaults avoids overreacting to limited early-period noise and keeps holding cost balanced against service level. If future conclude messages show delays or lost shipments, I will update L and use recent_N or explicit adjustments.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 context: on-hand=170, in-transit=0. Profit and holding cost are both $1/unit. Historical sample set for chips(Regular) is [107,252,298,376,544] (mean=314, std\u2248144). The only concluded lead-time observation (Period 1 conclude) shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (lead_time=0), so there is no evidence of longer or variable lead time. Given limited history and no sustained changepoint, I use the promised/default lead time and base the demand forecast on the full-sample statistics to let the OR backend compute base_stock and caps consistently. This keeps parameters stable: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all_samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples. Keeping defaults balances service level (using full-sample mean and variance) against holding cost without overreacting to one-period noise or a single arrival pattern.

Daily Reward (R_t): $44.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Recent concluded history shows two orders (P1,P2) both arrived with lead_time=0, so actual lead time appears consistent with the promised 0 but evidence is limited to 2 periods. Current on-hand=122, in-transit=0 so available inventory is 122. Demand history (environment samples) shows values [107,252,298,376,544]; with no clear changepoint and symmetric profit/holding ($1 profit, $1 holding) I use the default forecasting approach so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. I choose L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times rather than blindly trusting the promise, and use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes base_stock and cap from the full-sample mean/std. This balances service level (captures observed demand variability) against holding cost given equal profit/holding. No in-transit arrivals expected to conclude from prior periods, so avoid extra safety beyond backend's caps.

Daily Reward (R_t): $270.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P3 arrived in same period). Historical demand samples (chips Regular) show a clear upward trend across the five samples: 107, 252, 298, 376, 544 (mean=315.4). Given the sustained increasing demand over 5 periods, I use recent_N=5 for demand forecasting so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher regime. I keep L as default (promised lead time) because concluded messages consistently show lead_time=0. Using recent_N for mu_hat raises the backend base-stock to match the current elevated demand and using recent_N for sigma_hat captures the higher recent volatility; this reduces stockouts while keeping holding cost in check since profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) and the OR engine will cap orders appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed across Period_1\u2013Period_5: samples 107\u2192252\u2192298\u2192376\u2192544, 5-period mean=315.4 (sustained upward trend)

Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (periods 1\u20135) = [107,252,298,376,544] show a sustained upward regime with 5-period mean=315.4. Concluded arrival records for Periods 1\u20134 show all orders arrived same-period, so observed lead time = 0. No evidence of lost/delayed shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (will be 0). I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) = mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps the forecast anchored to the confirmed elevated demand regime while relying on observed zero lead time; it provides the OR engine with a higher base-stock to maintain service given high recent demand, while default volatility captures historical variability for safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $299.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision. Recent demand has shifted sharply up (samples show sustained rise across Periods 1\u20135 and concluded history: demands 146,166,368,426,507), on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand plus lead review. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u20135) show actual lead_time=0, so using default lead time is appropriate. Because the demand regime has clearly increased and is sustained across the last 5 periods, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base_stock from the most recent regime (captures higher mean and recent volatility). This balances service level (avoid lost sales in this higher-demand regime) against holding cost by letting the backend compute the appropriate z* (profit/(profit+holding)=0.5) and the capped ordering limit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $323.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u20136) shows every order arrived with lead_time=0 (orders placed and observed arrivals in same concluded period). Demand has trended sharply upward across the last six concluded periods (demands: 146, 166, 368, 426, 507, 636). Because promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=0, I use the default lead-time setting so the OR engine uses the promised lead time. I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all available demand samples \u2014 this leverages the full observed series (including recent high demand) and yields a base-stock that reflects the higher recent average while letting the OR engine apply the exact service-level cap and z* derived from profit vs holding cost. With profit = holding cost, the implied service-level target is 0.5 (z*\u22480), so using the full-sample default keeps orders conservative given equal profit/holding tradeoff and the verified zero lead time.

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 8, on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has been 0 in all observed periods (orders placed arrived same period). Demand has moved to a higher regime: recent concluded period demands (Periods 3\u20137) are high and volatile (368, 426, 507, 636, 618). The earlier supplied sample series (Period_1\u20135: 107,252,298,376,544) also indicated an upward trend confirmed in prior carry-over. To keep service while avoiding excessive holding cost (profit = holding cost = $1), I bias forecasting to recent high-demand behavior. Therefore I keep L at promised/default (0) since observed lead time = 0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap using the most recent high-demand regime (reduces stockouts from rising demand while letting the backend balance service level vs holding costs). No overdue or missing shipments detected, so no lead-time inflation applied.

Daily Reward (R_t): $511.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_times = 0 in Periods 1\u20138) and a sustained upward demand regime beginning around Period_4 and continuing through Period_8 (demands: P4=368/P5=426/P6=507/P7=636/P8=618/P8 conclude demand=775). Given profit=holding (both $1), the critical tradeoff is service vs. holding; with zero on-hand and no pipeline, we must replenish to cover the elevated recent demand. I set L="calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (which is 0) to remain consistent with concluded arrivals. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime while smoothing some variability; N=5 captures the most recent sustained regime (Periods 4\u20138) without overreacting to a single spike. This produces a base_stock tuned to the higher mean and higher volatility, raising order quantities to reduce stockouts while the cap still limits extreme orders. This approach balances service level (by reacting to confirmed higher demand) against holding cost (by using a short recent window rather than an explicit large safety stock). No lost shipments are evident in concluded history, so no explicit lead-time inflation is applied.

Daily Reward (R_t): $593.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time=0). Demand has accelerated sharply in recent periods (Period_6\u2013Period_9: 636, 618, 775, 831). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so the critical service-level quantile q = profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 (z*\u22480), meaning the OR backend will target roughly the forecast mean. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use a recent-window forecast. Choices: L set to "default" to trust promised lead time (0) because all concluded lead times = 0; mu_hat set to "recent_N" with N=5 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures recent surge while smoothing short-term noise); sigma_hat set to "recent_N" with N=5 so variability reflects recent volatility. This combination lets the OR engine raise base stock to meet the new higher demand while not overreacting to single-period spikes; using recent_N aligns the backend's (1+L)*mean and std inputs with the latest regime and helps balance service level vs holding cost given equal unit profit/holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg(P6\u2013P9)= (636+618+775+831)/4 = 715 vs prior Period_1\u2013Period_5 mean=315.4 (+127%), sustained for 4 periods (P6\u2013P9).

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 decision with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times on Periods 1\u201310 are all 0, so I keep promised lead time (L=0). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period_6 (periods 6\u201310: 636,618,775,831,993) \u2014 recent regime length = 5. To capture the new higher mean and recent volatility I use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent 5 samples. This targets service for the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods. With profit = holding ($1/$1) the implied critical ratio is 0.5; using recent data keeps base-stock responsive to the demand shift and avoids excess holding from older, lower-demand history. Because there are no in-transit units and arrivals are observed same-period historically, using L=default prevents unnecessary safety tied to phantom delays.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 start. All concluded arrivals from Period_1\u2013Period_11 show actual lead time = 0 (every conclude lists lead_time 0), so promised lead time (0) is confirmed. Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period_6 and remained high through Period_11: demands P6\u2013P11 = [636,618,775,831,993,1136] with mean = 831.5, well above the earlier Period_1\u2013P5 mean (315.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; given the sustained higher-demand regime, I set lead time to default (use promised 0) and ask the OR engine to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime to capture the new higher mean and volatility. I select recent_N with N=6 (the length of the confirmed high-demand regime P6\u2013P11) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This ensures the backend bases the base-stock on the elevated mean demand and higher variability, improving service during the sustained high-demand period while the holding cost (equal to profit) keeps the target service quantile conservative.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Period 6 extended through Period 11: avg(P6\u2013P11)=831.5 vs prior P1\u2013P5 mean=315.4 (+164%), sustained for 6 periods (P6\u2013P11).

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 context: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded orders from P1\u2013P12 had lead_time=0). Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime starting Period_6 and sustained through Period_12 (periods 6\u201312 show much higher demands than P1\u2013P5). Given the sustained higher-demand regime (length=7, P6\u2013P12), I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms promised lead time is accurate. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 7 samples and sqrt(1+L)*std of last 7 samples). This biases orders upward to cover the new higher average demand while letting the OR engine compute service-level safety stock consistent with profit vs holding cost. Using recent_N=7 balances responsiveness to the confirmed regime change vs sample noise and avoids overreacting to any single spike.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 decision with on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so I keep L as the promised/default (0). Demand shows a sustained, higher regime starting Period_6: recent demands (P6\u2013P13) = [636, 618, 775, 831, 993, 1136, 1302, 1175], mean = 933.25 units. I choose mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast on this sustained higher-demand regime; with L=0 this implies a one-period forecast \u2248933.25 units. Volatility has clearly increased vs early periods; I choose sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 so the backend measures variability from the same recent regime (sample std \u2248 257.1). Rationale summary: use default lead time because all concluded arrivals indicate L=0; use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast and uncertainty to the verified high-demand regime (Periods 6\u201313). This balances service (covering the much higher recent mean demand) against holding cost \u2014 using recent data prevents being dragged down by old low-demand samples while giving the OR engine a realistic volatility estimate for safety stock calculation.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 decision. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime since Period_6 and remains elevated through Period_14 (sustained high demand: P6\u2013P14). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current period demand immediately. Observed concluded lead times for Periods 1\u201314 are all 0, so average observed lead time = 0; I use the calculated average to confirm L=0. For demand forecasting I use a recent-window that captures the new high-demand regime (Periods 6\u201314, 9 periods) so the OR backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 9 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(last 9 samples). This recent_N approach adapts to the confirmed higher mean and volatility and helps the backend set a larger base-stock (higher \u03bc\u0302) to avoid rampant stockouts while the capped order cap will limit extreme single-period replenishment, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding. Recent_N N=9 is chosen because the new regime spans 9 periods (P6\u2013P14) and meets the minimum sustained-evidence requirement.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in every concluded period (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand clearly shifted up starting Period 6 and has remained high through Period 15. Mean demand over Period 6\u201315 = 1031.9 units/period (10 samples: 636,618,775,831,993,1136,1302,1175,1417,1436), so I use a recent-regime estimate to capture the sustained higher-demand environment. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by concluded history, so L uses default (promised=0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=10 to set the forecast to (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 samples, reflecting the new regime and avoiding dilution by earlier low-demand periods. sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=10 so safety stock reflects volatility observed in the same recent high-demand regime. Given profit = holding, the backend will target roughly the regime mean; these choices prioritize service (avoid lost sales in high-demand regime) while keeping holding cost in check by using only the sustained recent data rather than the full historical mean.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods for every observed order (Period1\u2192Period16 arrivals all concluded with lead_time=0). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 6 (historic samples and carry-over insights show a large upward shift: Period_1\u20135 mean=315.4, Period_6\u201316 all substantially larger). Given the long, sustained high-demand regime (roughly 11 periods from P6\u2013P16), I use a recent-window demand estimate so the OR engine bases base_stock on the elevated mean and variance rather than the older low-demand samples. Lead time: use default (promised) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 and there are no missing shipments to suggest longer or variable lead time. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=11 to capture the current high-demand regime (window covers P6\u2013P16 where demand is consistently elevated). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=11 to reflect the observed volatility in the current regime. These choices raise the backend's base_stock to satisfy (1+L) periods of current demand while keeping safety stock aligned with recent volatility; using recent data avoids understocking from older low-demand samples. No overdue or lost shipments are present (arrivals concluded each period), so no lead-time correction is required.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show all past orders had lead_time=0 (orders placed each period concluded same period). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period_6 ( Period_6\u2013Period_17 demand series = 636,618,775,831,993,1136,1302,1175,1417,1436,1578,1586 ). I therefore use the promised/default lead time (L=0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0-period lead time. To capture the sustained post-Period_5 demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (the length of the high-demand regime from Period_6\u2013Period_17). This focuses the forecast and variability on the current high-demand regime so the OR backend will compute a higher base_stock to avoid lost sales while accepting higher holding cost tradeoffs (profit and holding cost are equal, so service-level q=0.5; using recent demand stats keeps safety stock aligned with current volatility). No overdue shipments or lost arrivals detected.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. Demand has been on a sustained higher regime since Period 6. Recent concluded demands (Periods 6\u201318) average \u22481180 units/period (13 samples), well above the early-period mean (~315). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we have no coverage for upcoming demand; no overdue shipments are visible in conclude messages. Historical conclude logs show arrivals every period with observed lead_time=0 consistently, so promised lead time=0 remains supported by evidence. To capture the elevated, sustained demand regime I set L to default (promised lead time=0) and use a recent_N approach for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 13 demand samples (Periods 6\u201318) to reflect the current higher mean and volatility. This focuses the backend forecast on the current regime (reducing stockouts) while the lead time default avoids over-penalizing inventory for a lead time change that has not been observed. Given profit=holding ($1/$1) the backend will target a 50% critical fractile; using recent demand stats helps balance service level vs holding cost under the new higher-demand regime.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order from Period_1\u201319 arrived with lead_time=0 (observed concluded messages all indicate 0), so actual lead time remains 0. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_6 and sustained through Period_19 (large consistent demands), so I use recent data from the high-demand regime rather than the much lower P1\u2013P5 samples. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand forecast (mu_hat) I choose recent_N with N=14 (Periods 6\u201319) because the sustained regime length is 14 periods; this gives (1+L)*mean of the most recent 14 samples and focuses the base-stock on the current high-demand level. For sigma_hat I also choose recent_N with N=14 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These parameters will steer the OR engine to a base stock appropriate for the sustained high demand while keeping holding costs in mind (L=0 avoids inflating pipeline coverage).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 context: chips(Regular) has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have all been 0 periods (orders in Periods 1\u201320 concluded with lead_time=0). Demand shows a sustained high regime beginning at Period 6; recent periods (P6\u2013P20) exhibit much higher average demand than P1\u2013P5. No shipments are overdue or missing in concluded history. Given the clear, sustained demand increase, I set L using observed lead times (calculate) and set demand estimates using recent data to capture the new regime. Specifically, mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=15 (the regime length from Period 6\u2013Period 20) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most relevant high-demand regime. This biases orders toward meeting the much higher current demand while the backend's capped policy will still limit extreme orders. Using recent_N reduces stockouts during this sustained high-demand period while avoiding overstating variability from much older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed from Period 6 through Period 20: avg(P6\u2013P20)=1275.13 vs prior P1\u2013P5 mean=315.4 (+304.4%), sustained for 15 periods

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period_6 and sustained through Period_21 (substantially above P1\u2013P5). I set L using 'calculate' to reflect the observed average lead time (all concluded lead times = 0). For demand forecasting I use recent_N on the most recent sustained high-demand regime: Period_6\u2013Period_21 is 16 periods of elevated demand, so I choose N=16 to capture the new mean and volatility rather than diluting with the much lower P1\u2013P5 values. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock calculation on the current high-demand regime, improving service (higher base stock) while the backend will cap orders to limit excessive inventory. This balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by matching forecasted demand and observed low lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23. Recent history shows a sustained, large upward demand regime beginning at Period_6 and continuing through Period_22 (eg. Period_6\u2013P22 average >> Period_1\u2013P5). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover the higher regime. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so using promised/default lead time=0 is supported. To capture the post-changepoint demand level I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent consistent regime (Periods 6\u201322, 17 samples). N=17 (within the rules: N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). This biases the backend forecast toward the higher recent mean and variance, increasing orders to meet demand while the capped policy still limits extreme over-ordering. Using recent_N for sigma_hat increases safety stock consistent with higher observed volatility, balancing service level against holding cost when on-hand inventory begins to accumulate.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24. Recent history shows a sustained, large upward demand regime starting at Period_6 and continuing through Period_23 (much higher means than P1\u2013P5). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals expected and no overdue shipments visible. Promised lead time = 0 and historically all concluded arrivals have lead_time=0, so use the default promised lead time. For demand forecasting I use a recent_N approach to capture the new high-demand regime: I set mu_hat to use the last 18 periods (Period_6\u2013Period_23) because the regime has been sustained (~18 periods) and N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) = 18. Similarly, sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=18 to reflect volatility in the recent high-demand regime. These choices (recent data window equal to the sustained regime) give the OR backend a forecast that matches current elevated demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability; using L=default (promised 0) aligns ordering timing with observed same-period arrivals. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost by basing base_stock and cap on the current high-demand mean and its recent volatility.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25: demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods (recent demands large and growing). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we have no coverage for current period demand and must order to meet elevated recent demand. Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order arrived same period), so use default lead time. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 20\u201324: demands = 2032,2126,2270,2186,2504; recent mean \u2248 2223.6) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect variability in the current high-demand window. These choices bias the OR backend toward stocking to meet the high recent demand while keeping variability estimates focused on the recent regime; with profit=holding cost the backend will balance service vs holding via its z* calculation.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 observed. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201325) show every order arriving with lead_time=0 consistently, so promised lead time appears accurate. Demand has shifted upward and stayed high since Period 6; the most recent 20 periods (P6\u2013P25) represent the current high-demand regime and should drive the forecast to avoid stockouts. I therefore keep L at default (use promised lead time = 0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use last 20 samples for mean and volatility across the review+lead period). This raises the base-stock to match current demand and the backend will cap orders appropriately; using recent_N reduces underordering from stale low-demand samples and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order from Period_1\u2013Period_26 arrived with lead_time=0, so actual lead time remains 0. Demand has been in a sustained, higher regime since Period_6; last 21 periods (P6\u2013P26) show materially higher mean and volatility than P1\u2013P5. I choose L via "calculate" to reflect observed lead times (backend will compute the average observed lead time from concluded messages). For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable high-demand regime while limiting sensitivity to single-period spikes (the policy guidance caps N at 20). This ensures the base-stock target reflects current elevated mean demand and that the cap accounts for current volatility, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed from Period 6 through Period 26: avg(P6\u2013P26)=1578.52 vs prior P1\u2013P5 mean=315.4 (+401%), sustained for 21 periods

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201327) show every order arrived same period it was ordered (observed lead_time=0 each concluded order), so actual lead time remains 0. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period_6 (many periods of elevated demand through Period_27). Pipeline is empty going into decision, so we must restock to cover the elevated recent demand. Decisions: set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0) so the backend accounts for current realized lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime (use the last 20 demand samples to capture current mean and volatility). Using recent_N for both mean and volatility prioritizes service level during this high-demand period while keeping holding risk visible to the OR engine; this balances profit vs holding cost by letting the OR compute the z* service factor given profit=holding cost while using a demand estimate centered on the recent elevated regime.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 context: demand has been in a sustained, high regime since Period_6 and recent realized demands remain very large (Periods 24\u201328 demands = 2504, 2479, 2457, 2508, 2890). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish immediately to avoid lost sales. Observed concluded lead times for prior arrivals are all 0 (orders arrived same period), so I use the default promised lead time (L=0). For demand forecast I focus on the most recent stable regime: last 5 periods capture the current elevated mean while avoiding dilution by older low-demand periods\u2014set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples \u2248 2567.6 units). Volatility should reflect the same recent window, so set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 (backend will compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 5 samples). These choices push the OR engine toward a base stock sized for the current high-demand regime while keeping safety stock aligned to recent variability; using recent_N prevents underordering from legacy low-demand samples. Given profit=holding, the backend will trade service level vs holding cost using q=0.5; my parameters ensure adequate coverage of the immediate high demand given zero pipeline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30. Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201329) show every order arrived in the same period it was ordered (arrived=... lead_time was 0 periods repeatedly). This confirms actual lead time = 0 so far, matching the promised 0. Demand has exhibited a sustained high regime since Period_6; recent periods remain at elevated levels. To keep the OR engine responsive to the sustained elevated-demand regime while still smoothing short-term noise, I use a recent_N window focused on the most recent 20 demand samples for both the demand mean and volatility. L is left as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show zero lead time. mu_hat: recent_N (N=20) captures the sustained high-demand regime (reduces weight of earlier low-demand samples). sigma_hat: recent_N (N=20) captures volatility in the same recent window. These settings help the OR backend raise the base-stock level to match the elevated demand (improving service and units_sold) while using a 20-period recent estimate to avoid overreacting to short blips; since profit and holding cost are equal, the implied service quantile is 0.5, so mu_hat mainly drives order quantities. No overdue shipments or lost orders are evident.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31 decision. Demand has exhibited a sustained, large upward regime since Period_6 through Period_30 (historical concludes show arrivals each period with lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current period demand. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0 (every conclude message lists lead_time=0), so I will use the default promised lead time. Given the long, sustained higher-demand regime and no evidence of a new changepoint since Period_26, I defer to the backend's default demand estimator (which will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to produce a stable mu_hat and the default sigma_hat for volatility. This keeps the policy simple and leverages the full sample history; with profit=holding cost the backend's critical fractile is 0.5 (z*=0) so base_stock equals mu_hat, balancing service level and holding cost. If future concludes show lead-time slips or missing arrivals, I'll switch to an explicit/recent estimate, but current concluded history supports using defaults.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period_6 (much higher than P1\u2013P5). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we start the decision with no coverage for upcoming demand. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201331) show actual lead_time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so I trust the promised lead time and use the default L. Because demand has shifted upward and the most relevant information is the most recent samples, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead demand estimate and volatility on the last 20 periods (N=20 is chosen because the recent high-demand regime length is >20 and N is capped at 20). This increases responsiveness to the elevated demand while keeping variability estimates aligned with the recent regime; that helps the OR backend compute a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while the sigma estimate disciplines order caps to limit excessive holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals state lead_time was 0). Demand has been in a sustained, higher regime since Period 6 (long series of elevated demands through Period 32). I therefore keep L = default (promised lead time) which matches observed lead_time=0. For demand forecasting I use recent_N on the most recent high-demand regime: regime since Period 6 is long (Periods 6\u201332 = 27 periods), so I choose N = 20 (rule: N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). Using recent_N for mu_hat focuses the base-stock on the current high-demand mean and avoids dilution by the much lower early-period samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N = 20 to capture current volatility in the same recent window. These choices steer the OR backend to target a base stock appropriate to the current elevated demand (improving service and profit) while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock and holding cost given holding cost equals profit per unit.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34 decision context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show promised lead_time=0 was honored consistently (all concluded orders P1\u2013P33 arrived same period). Demand has a sustained, large upward regime vs P1\u2013P5: recent weeks (P6\u2013P33) show much higher demand and continued growth; latest concluded demands P28\u2013P33 remain very high (2890,2959,3004,3152,3151,3344). Given zero observed pipeline and immediate demand after ordering (lead_time=0), we must size the review+lead demand estimate to cover the (1+L) periods of exposure (L=0 \u2192 one-period demand). Method choices: L="default" to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; mu_hat="recent_N", N=20 to base the demand forecast on the most recent 20 concluded demand samples (focus on the latest regime and avoid dilution by early low-demand periods); sigma_hat="recent_N", N=20 to capture realized volatility in the same recent window. This choice increases the base-stock target to match the elevated recent demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock (via q derived from profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5). Using recent_N for both mean and volatility balances service (prevent stockouts when demand is very high) against holding cost by restricting the estimate to the most relevant, sustained high-demand regime rather than the full historical average that would under-react to the regime shift. Also, with no in-transit inventory and lead_time=0, the order placed this period will be available for the period's demand; thus the backend will produce an order to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the computed base_stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed extended: Period 6\u2013Period 33 avg demand = 1934.9 vs prior Period 1\u20135 mean = 315.4 (+514%), sustained for 28 periods

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Recent demand has been at a materially higher regime since Period 6 and confirmed through Period 34 (sustained high demand). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we have no coverage for upcoming demand; no overdue or missing arrivals to reconcile because all prior orders conclusively arrived with observed lead_time=0. Promised lead time remains 0 so I keep L as default. To capture the sustained elevated demand while giving the OR engine enough recent data, I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (20 is the cap for a long recent regime and balances responsiveness with stability). This focuses the forecast on the most recent 20 periods of demand (which reflect the new high-demand regime) so the backend's base-stock calculation raises order targets to avoid stockouts while the capped-order logic and explicit sigma estimate limit extreme order sizes and control holding cost. Using recent demand for sigma also captures current volatility rather than diluting it with much older low-demand periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Observed history shows a sustained, large upward demand regime beginning at Period 6 and continuing through Period 35 (many consecutive periods with demand >> Period1\u20135 baseline). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no overdue or missing arrivals in concluded history (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead times remain 0, so I keep L as default (promised lead time). For demand forecasting I detect a long, sustained regime beginning at Period 6; to capture the recent high-demand level while smoothing short-term noise I use recent_N with N=20 (regime length >>20, rule caps N at 20). This sets mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 samples, which biases the base-stock toward the current high-demand regime and thus raises target inventory to avoid stockouts. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility rather than the much lower early-period variability. These choices (recent_N N=20 for mu and sigma, default L=0) tell the OR backend to target a base-stock appropriate for the sustained high-demand regime while using recent volatility to size safety stock; that balances higher service (avoid lost sales/profit) against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; historical concluded arrivals for every order show lead_time=0 (orders placed in Period t arrived in Period t as recorded in Period t conclude messages), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand has been in a sustained, higher regime since Period 6 (large, persistent uplift vs Periods 1\u20135). To capture the current elevated demand level while keeping volatility estimates responsive to recent variation, I use recent_N with N=20 (the most recent 20 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history matches promised lead time. Using the recent 20 samples captures the long-lived regime shift (regime length >> 20) but still limits weight of older, lower-demand periods. Given profit = holding cost ($1/$1), the critical fractile q = 0.5 => z*\u22480, so base stock will be near the mean demand across (1+L) review+lead period; choosing recent_N ensures that mean reflects the current, much higher demand and reduces frequent stockouts. Sigma from recent_N supplies the OR backend with a current volatility estimate so the capped order is sized appropriately and the cap calculation remains meaningful.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 decision. Recent history shows every order from Period 1 through Period 37 concluded with arrived equal to ordered and lead_time = 0 each time (confirmed same-period arrivals). Demand has been in an elevated, sustained regime since Period 6 (large increases vs early periods). Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0 (no pending arrivals visible). Given confirmed actual lead time = 0 (consistent across all concluded periods), use the default promised lead time to match observed behavior. For demand forecasting use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base_stock from the full sample mean and variance (default mu_hat and sigma_hat) which captures the long-run elevated demand regime present in the history. This balances service level (higher base stock because mean demand is high) against holding cost; given profit = holding cost here (profit $1, holding $1), the backend will target q = 0.5 and the computed base stock will reflect the full-sample mean and volatility. Using defaults also avoids overfitting to short-term noise while the lead time is confirmed as 0 and all past arrivals are reliable.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals for chips(Regular) show every observed order from Period 1 through Period 38 arrived in the same period it was ordered (concluded lead_time=0 each time). No overdue or missing shipments in concluded history, so actual lead time is consistent with the promised 0. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 6 (user-provided carry-over history). To keep the OR engine responsive to the sustained, elevated recent demand while limiting excessive holding cost, I set L to the default (use promised lead time=0) and base demand forecasts on the most recent data window. I choose recent_N with N=20 (the backend rule: N = min(regime_length,20) capped, using the long post-Period-6 regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock calculation reflects current high-demand regime and recent volatility. This increases the target base-stock to support service without over-emphasizing older, much lower historical samples. Carry-over notes: no new sustained pattern beyond already-documented regime shift, and no evidence of lost shipments.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 context: all concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 for every order (arrivals always in same period as order). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must order to cover immediate demand. Demand has been in a sustained, higher regime since Period 6 (carry-over insights confirm large, persistent increase vs Period 1\u20135). To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N methods that focus the forecast on the most recent data: set mu_hat using the last 20 demand samples to reflect the established high-demand level and reduce bias from the low early-period samples; set sigma_hat using the last 20 samples to reflect current volatility. For L I select default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages consistently show 0-period lead time. Using recent_N (N=20) for mean and std helps the OR backend compute a base-stock that targets service under the current regime while keeping holding cost in check (it avoids over-weighting the low early-period demand). This also addresses the immediate operational fact that on-hand+pipeline=0 and we need replenishment to meet same-period demand.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus lead time. Historical concluded arrivals show every order arrived with lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u201340), so promised lead time remains valid. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period_6 (large, persistent increase vs Period_1\u20135). To capture the current high-level demand while limiting sensitivity to older low-demand samples, I select recent_N with N=20 (last 20 demand samples, Period_21\u2013Period_40) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This uses the most relevant demand data (captures the sustained high regime) while smoothing short-term noise. L uses the default promised lead time (0). These settings give the OR backend an estimate tuned to the elevated demand so base-stock will replenish enough to meet service goals; using recent_N also avoids over-weighting early low-demand history which would understock. With profit=holding, backend will aim for a 50% critical fractile; using recent demand and recent volatility helps balance lost-sales service vs holding costs.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201341) show every order arriving in the same period it was ordered (lead_time observed = 0 each time). Demand has been in a sustained, elevated regime for many periods (carry-over history through Period 34 and beyond). Given consistently observed zero actual lead time and a long, stable high-demand regime, I choose to trust the promised lead time (default L=0) and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample history (default) so the engine benefits from the long-run elevated-demand estimates and its built-in cap. This balances service level (captures sustained high mean) against holding cost by using the backend's base-stock calculation with full-sample statistics while keeping lead-time risk minimal because arrivals have been reliably same-period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P42) show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 every concluded order), so promised lead time is reliable. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 6 (carry-over insights already record multi-period shift). To keep service amid high, volatile demand while avoiding excess holding cost, I select L=default (use promised lead time=0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the base-stock calculation on the most recent 20 periods (captures current high-demand regime while smoothing short noise). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility. This ensures the OR backend sizes orders to cover (1+L) periods of the current high-demand regime and sets safety stock consistent with recent variability. No overdue or missing shipments to account for.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44 decision. Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained high regime since Period_6 with large growth vs initial Period_1\u20135. Recent demands (Periods 24\u201343) remain elevated and volatile (multi-thousand units), so I will size the review+lead demand using a recent-window estimate to reflect the current regime rather than the long-run baseline. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded orders historically have arrived with lead_time=0 (no evidence of delayed or lost shipments), so I use the default promised lead time. For mu_hat I choose recent_N (N=20) to capture the most recent 20 demand periods and produce (1+L)*mean over that recent regime, which helps the OR backend order to meet current high demand and reduce stockouts. For sigma_hat I also choose recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility when computing safety stock. These choices prioritize avoiding lost sales in the clearly higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff via its z*-calculation.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 decision. Context: all concluded periods (P1\u2013P44) show consistent same-period arrivals (arrived=ordered, lead_time=0 every concluded order) and steadily elevated demand since Period 6. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no overdue or hidden arrivals). Promised lead time = 0 and confirmed by concluded history, so I use the default promised lead time. Demand regime is the higher regime that began at Period 6 and has persisted through Period 44; to capture the most relevant recent demand level while smoothing older variability I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent-window estimate. I choose recent_N with N=20 (the backend rule: N = min(regime_length,20)) to reflect the most recent 20 demand samples (gives responsiveness to recent trend while using enough data for stable mean/std). Because profit = holding cost, target service quantile is 0.5 (z*=0), so base_stock equals mu_hat; using a recent-window mean keeps orders aligned with current high demand and avoids overstock from much older low-demand samples. Using recent std for sigma_hat ensures the OR engine\u2019s cap considers recent volatility. This keeps service high while limiting holding cost exposure given zero observed lead time.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. All historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201345) show every order arrived the same period it was ordered (observed lead_time = 0 each time). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods (recent demands >> early samples). Because actual lead time has been consistently 0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments), I will use the default lead-time setting so the OR engine uses the promised lead time. For demand forecast and volatility I choose the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample history \u2014 this captures the long-run high-demand regime already present in the data. Using defaults also keeps the OR cap calculation aligned with the engine's internal statistics; with profit = holding cost, the critical fractile is 0.5, so a full-history mean/std approach balances service level vs holding cost conservatively given no new changepoint or late shipments to adjust for.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47. Recent history shows a sustained, large upward demand regime since Period 6 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0); on-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded orders historically show actual lead time = 0, so I use the default (promised) lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with observed deliveries. Demand has been growing and volatile; to capture the most relevant recent demand level while smoothing short-term noise I select recent_N with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (using the last 10 demand samples gives the backend a focused, recent mean and variance for the (1+L) review+lead period). This N balances responsiveness to the elevated regime while avoiding overfitting a single spike. With Profit = Holding cost, the backend will compute z* = \u03a6\u22121(0.5)=0 so safety stock is driven by sigma_hat; providing recent volatility helps the backend size the cap and base-stock appropriately to avoid excessive stock (holding cost) while keeping service for much-higher recent demand. I flag that on-hand + pipeline = 0, so orders placed will need to cover current period demand as the arrival occurs after the decision; the chosen recent_N parameters prioritize meeting observed high demand with an empirically focused forecast.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. History shows every concluded order from Period_1 through Period_47 arrived in the same period it was ordered (observed lead_time = 0 each conclude). Demand has been through a sustained, large upward regime since Period_6 (much higher than the Period_1\u20135 baseline). With no evidence of delayed or lost shipments in concluded history, I use the promised/default lead time. For demand sizing I focus on the most recent regime to capture the current elevated mean and volatility \u2014 using a recent_N window to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean over the latest data, which raises base_stock to cover high ongoing demand while sigma from the same recent window captures current variability. Choosing N=20 balances responsiveness to recent demand levels (reducing overweighting very-old low-demand periods) while smoothing short-term noise. This combination increases service level to avoid lost sales in the high-demand regime but keeps sigma-based safety stock aligned with observed recent volatility so holding cost is not excessively inflated.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision. Demand has been in a clearly higher regime since Period_6 (sustained high demand through Period_48). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; all historical conclude messages show orders arrived with lead_time=0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times confirm same-period arrivals throughout history, so use default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with supplier promise. For demand forecasting I focus on the recent high-demand regime: regime from Period_6 onward is long-lived (many periods) and much higher than the Period_1\u20135 baseline, so using a recent-window estimate captures current demand level while limiting influence of very early low-demand samples. I choose recent_N with N=20 (the policy guideline: N = max(min(regime_length,20),3); regime_length >>20 so cap at 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most recent 20 demand samples. This raises the base-stock to match current elevated demand, while recent volatility will inform safety stock. Using default L=0 avoids artificially inflating the (1+L) horizon. These choices help the OR backend balance service (capturing the new higher mean and recent variability) against holding cost by not over-weighting old low-demand periods or inflating lead time.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet immediate-period demand. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed in each period have arrived in the same period across the entire history), so using the promised/default lead time (L=0) is appropriate. Demand has been in a sustained high regime for many periods; recent demands (Periods 45\u201349 = 4605, 4638, 4955, 4820, 4681) average \u2248 4740. To keep the OR engine responsive to the current high-demand regime and avoid underordering, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent demand level). Volatility has also increased versus the early periods, so I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect current variability. These choices increase the base-stock to match current demand while the OR backend will still cap orders; using recent data keeps holding risk reasonable given holding_cost = profit (q = 0.5).
