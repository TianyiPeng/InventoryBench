  "rationale": "a) World/product: chips(Regular) is a snack item with relatively steady everyday demand; no calendar/seasonal cue provided for Period_1. b) Demand regime analysis: historical samples for this SKU: [146,110,112,150,59]. Sample mean = 115.4 units, recent values vary but show typical demand around ~110\u2013150 with one low outlier (59). c) Lead_time vs missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unconfirmed (no conclude history). Orders placed now may arrive same period but we have no confirmed evidence; treat promised 0 as the working assumption but remain cautious. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0, so only a new order can provide stock for Period_1 demand (arrives after decision if lead_time=0). e) Final order logic: Profit per unit = $1, holding cost per unit = $1 per period. Net expected contribution per ordered unit = P(sold)*$1 - P(unsold)*$1 = 2*P(sold) - 1. Thus order if the probability a unit sells in the period >50%. Historical demand center (~115 units) implies >50% chance each of first ~115 units sell. Given high downside of missed sales (lost $1 profit per unit sold) and equal holding cost, target stocking near the historical mean. Conservatively order 115 units to serve expected demand while avoiding excessive ending inventory.",

The only concluded period (Period 1) showed realized demand 88, ending inventory 27. With only one concluded period, there is no sustained regime shift to record.\nc) Lead time / orders: Period 1 conclude explicitly reported the P1 order arrived in P1 with lead_time = 0 periods. This single observation indicates same-period arrival is possible; however the carry-over rule requires sustained evidence (3+ periods) before recording a lead-time change, so I will not record a new insight.\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 27, In-transit = 0. Since promised lead time = 0 and we observed an arrival with lead_time=0 in Period 1, an order placed now should arrive during Period 2 and be available to meet Period 2 demand. There are no overdue or in-transit shipments to account for.\ne) Final order logic: Expected Period_2 demand \u2248 110. To maximize reward given Profit = $1/unit sold and Holding = $1/unit/period (high holding cost equal to profit), avoid overstock. Order enough so on-hand + arrivals \u2248 expected demand.

There is evidence of occasional spikes (P3 had unmet demand 121 while sold limited by on-hand), but with only three concluded periods this is noisy. c) Lead time / arrivals: Concluded messages for Periods 1\u20133 show orders placed each period arrived in the same period (arrived=ordered, lead_time was 0 periods).

The single large value in P16 appears to be an outlier rather than a confirmed regime shift because we lack 3+ consecutive periods of elevated demand. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Concluded history consistently reports arrived=ordered with lead_time=0 for many periods (Periods 1\u201316).
