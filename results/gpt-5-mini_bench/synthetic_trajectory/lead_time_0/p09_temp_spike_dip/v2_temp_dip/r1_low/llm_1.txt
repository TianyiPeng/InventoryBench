With no evidence of delays or lost shipments, assume promised lead time may hold but remain cautious. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. We must cover current-period demand after ordering; arrivals may occur same period if lead_time = 0, otherwise they will arrive later. Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit held per period vs $1 profit/unit sold), so excess inventory is expensive and we should avoid significant overstock. e) Final order logic: use the historical mean demand (~100) as the best unbiased forecast for this period. Given high holding cost, order approximately expected demand rather than adding large safety stock. Therefore place an order of 100 units to match expected sales while minimizing holding exposure.",

A conservative short-term forecast is around ~65\u201375 units; using the midpoint ~72 units is reasonable.\n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Orders placed in P1 and P2 both arrived in the same period (arrived=ordered in both conclude messages). That is evidence of actual lead time = 0 for two periods, but the carry-over rule requires \u22653 periods of consistent evidence before recording a persistent lead-time insight, so I will not record it yet.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 89, in-transit = 0.

Long-run behavior shows frequent demands around 90\u2013120 with occasional spikes; use recent mean \u224895 as best single-period forecast. c) Lead time / pipeline: History and provided carry-over show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). On-hand = 37, in-transit = 0, so any order placed now will arrive in time to satisfy Period 45 demand. d) Inventory assessment: Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals unit profit $1, so leftover ending inventory directly reduces objective dollar-for-dollar. That makes carrying excess inventory costly; we should target expected demand (to avoid both unnecessary holding cost and lost profit). e) Order logic: Forecast demand \u224895 units this period.

Demand is volatile but shows no sustained upward or downward shift requiring a new regime. c) Lead time / pipeline: Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (already recorded). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so no available inventory. d) Inventory & risk: Profit = $1/unit, Holding cost = $1/unit/period. Because holding cost per period equals profit per unit, carrying positive ending inventory into the next period effectively erases that unit's profit (one period holding cost would consume $1 profit). Therefore we should avoid building safety stock unless justified by a sustained demand increase. e) Order logic: With lead time = 0, an order placed now will arrive before demand. Forecast for Period 47 is ~89 units (5-period recent average). Given high demand variability but the symmetric economics (profit = holding cost per period) it's optimal to order roughly the expected demand and avoid extra inventory. Final order: 89 units.",

No in-transit shipments to track; no missing orders. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=20, in-transit=0.

Longer-run history fluctuates but centers around ~100\u2013120 with occasional dips; no sustained regime shift seen.\n\nc) Lead time & missing orders: Historical conclude messages (including earlier confirmed insight) show supplier actual lead time = 0 periods and recent history shows every order arrived same period it was placed.
