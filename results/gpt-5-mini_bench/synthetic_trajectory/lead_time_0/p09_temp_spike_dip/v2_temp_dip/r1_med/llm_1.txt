Recent two periods (Period_4=58, Period_5=121) show noise but no sustained shift. c) Lead time / missing orders: supplier promised lead time = 0 but we have no concluded arrivals yet to confirm actual lead time; shipments could arrive same period or be delayed/lost. No evidence to infer lead-time changes. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Current period demand will occur after decision, and any order may or may not arrive this period. To avoid severe stockouts (lost sales forego $4 profit/unit) while limiting holding cost ($1/unit/period), I target expected demand (~100 units) for this period. Ordering roughly the mean balances expected profit against holding cost given lead-time uncertainty. e) Final order logic: place an order of 100 units to meet expected period demand while avoiding excessive ending inventory that would incur holding cost and reduce net reward. If arrivals are delayed or lost, future periods will reveal lead-time issues and I will adjust ordering and safety stock accordingly.",

The game history shows Period_1 actual demand = 89. With only one concluded period observed, there is no strong evidence of a sustained regime shift; therefore use the ~100-unit baseline as the best forecast for Period_2.\n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Period_1 order (100) arrived in Period_1 with lead_time = 0 periods (concluded message). That confirms at least one observation of same-period arrival. There are no overdue or missing shipments in the pipeline (In-transit = 0).\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 11, In-transit = 0. If expected demand \u2248 100 this period, we need roughly 100 - 11 = 89 additional units to meet demand and avoid stockout. Promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time = 0 for the Period_1 order, so an order placed now will arrive this period and can serve Period_2 demand.\n\ne) Final order logic: Balance service level against holding cost: profit per sold unit = $4, holding cost = $1/unit/period (25% of per-unit profit). Given the relatively high expected demand and the asymmetric cost of lost sales (foregone $4 profit) vs holding ($1 per unit), it's optimal to replenish to meet the forecast rather than understock. I order 89 units to bring on-hand to ~100 units to satisfy expected demand for this period while avoiding excess holding.\n",

There have been occasional large observed demands (141 in P9, 153 in P12) but those were partly constrained by starting inventory in P9 and P12 respectively; the consistent realized-sales mean over the last several periods is ~95\u2013100 units.

No overdue or lost orders observed. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. With confirmed lead_time=0, any order placed now will arrive before demand in Period 40. e) Final order logic: Because holding cost = $1/ unit/period vs. profit = $4/unit, overstock is costly (25% of unit profit per unit held). To balance service level and holding cost, I target the recent short-window demand estimate (~97 units) but round slightly up to reduce stockout risk. Therefore I will order 100 units (arriving this period) to meet expected Period 40 demand while keeping expected ending inventory low.",
