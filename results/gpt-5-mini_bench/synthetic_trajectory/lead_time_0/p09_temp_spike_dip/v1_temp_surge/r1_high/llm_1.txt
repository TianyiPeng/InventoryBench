Variability moderate (range 92\u2013131). c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but no concluded arrivals observed yet; no evidence to confirm actual lead time is different. Cannot assume late/lost shipments without conclude messages. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. If actual lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive during Period_1 and can satisfy Period_1 demand; if lead_time>=1, orders placed now will not arrive in time and we will stockout this period. Given high unit profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1/period), understocking is costlier (lost profit) than modest overstock holding cost. e) Final order logic: Order slightly above the historical mean to target high service: 120 units \u2248 mean(114.4) + small safety buffer to cover variability while keeping holding cost modest.",

The single observed period in-game (Period 1 demand=86) is lower than that mean but is only one data point and not sufficient to conclude a regime shift. c) Lead time / orders: Period 1 conclude shows the Period 1 order (120) arrived in Period 1 with lead_time = 0 periods (explicitly stated). That confirms actual lead time = 0 so orders placed now will arrive during Period 2 and be available to meet Period 2 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Expected demand for the coming period ~114 units (using the multi-period historical average as the primary forecast). Because profit per sold unit ($19) far exceeds holding cost ($1/period), understocking is much more costly than modest overstock. With lead_time=0 we can satisfy demand within the same period. e) Final order logic: target on-hand to cover forecasted Period 2 demand of ~114 units.

Recent 3-period average (P5\u2013P7) = (106+77+67)/3 = 83.3 units; 7-period average = 91.9 units. The last three periods show a downward trend (106 -> 77 -> 67) but the longer-run mean is ~92. I treat expected next-period demand as ~90 units (balance between recent decline and longer-run mean).\n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Carry-over insight from Period 4 already confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive same period). Recent concludes (P5\u2013P7) show arrivals matched orders, so continue to assume L=0 and no lost shipments.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: Current on-hand = 41, in-transit = 0.
