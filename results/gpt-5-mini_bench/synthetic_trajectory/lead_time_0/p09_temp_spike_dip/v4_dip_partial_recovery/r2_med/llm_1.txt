The most recent three periods show higher demand (65 -> 106 -> 136) suggesting a recent upward regime. Using recent data is prudent. c) Newsvendor math: profit per unit = $4 (underage cost if stockout), holding cost = $1 (overage cost). Critical fractile = Cu/(Cu+Co) = 4/(4+1) = 0.8. d) Demand forecast/distribution: empirical sorted demands = [65,82,89,106,136].

There is risk actual lead time could be >0, but we have no concluded arrivals to prove that; therefore we place an order sized to meet one-period demand at the 0.8 fractile. f) Final order logic: Order 122 units to target an 80% service level for one period given recent upward demand evidence, balancing high profit vs holding cost.",

The game's Period_1 conclude shows 108 sold, but the pre-supplied historical series lists Period_2 = 89; for Period_2 decision I rely primarily on the direct historical sample for Period_2 (89) and the existing carry-over insight which already recorded the later upward shift beginning Period_3. c) Lead-time vs. missing orders: Period_1 order (122) arrived in Period_1 with lead_time = 0 periods. No in-transit units are shown now. So actual lead time is confirmed as 0; with L=0, any order placed now would arrive during Period_2 but only be visible in the Period_2 conclude message (observed at Period_3 start). d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 14, in-transit = 0. With L=0 we must cover (L+1)=1 period of demand (current period) with on-hand + new order because arrivals occur after decision but within the same period for L=0. Forecast for Period_2 demand = 89 units. e) Final order logic: To meet expected demand and avoid lost sales (which foregoes $4/unit profit), order enough to bring available inventory to the forecasted demand. Required = 89 - 14 = 75 units. Holding cost is $1/unit/period; since lead time is 0 we can avoid excess stock and reorder next period if needed. Therefore place order for 75 units.",

The problem statement earlier flagged a demand regime shift starting Period_3\u2013Period_5 (recent 3-period avg \u2248102.3 vs earlier avg 85.5, ~+20%). Current evidence (two concluded periods with high sales) supports elevated demand relative to initial baseline but is not yet an additional sustained pattern beyond the previously noted shift. c) Lead time / arrival inference: Both prior orders (Period 1 and Period 2) arrived within the same period they were ordered (concludes explicitly show lead_time=0). Therefore actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Orders placed now will arrive during this same period and can satisfy Period 3 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. No overdue orders. Because lead time = 0, we can order exactly to cover expected demand for this period. e) Final order logic: Given strong recent sales (108 and 144) and the documented regime shift toward higher demand, I forecast Period 3 demand around the recent average (~126). To avoid lost sales (which forfeit $4 profit per unit) while minimizing holding cost ($1 per unit for any ending inventory), I order close to expected demand.

These indicate a sustained higher-demand regime around ~140 units. The earlier provided carry-over insight noted a regime shift beginning Period_3\u2013Period_5; no new contradictory evidence seen. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Concluded messages show orders placed in P1\u2013P3 arrived the same period (lead_time was 0 each time).

There is noticeable volatility (spike in P2\u2013P3 then decline P4\u2013P5), so I use the 3-period recent average as the best unbiased forecast for Period_6 demand (~94). c) Lead time vs missing orders: All concluded messages (Periods 1\u20135) show ordered units arriving in the same period (arrived units show lead_time = 0).

Recent five-period demands (P22\u2013P26) = [68, 28, 39, 31, 112], 5-period average = 55.6. The last three periods (P24\u2013P26) = [39, 31, 112], 3-period average = 60.7. The P26 demand=112 appears to be a single large spike rather than a sustained shift (only one high value). Therefore I treat the true short-run expected demand as roughly 55\u201361 units, with downside risk toward the ~30s and occasional spikes.\n\nc) Lead time and missing orders: Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive same period). In-transit = 0 and there are no overdue shipments.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, an order placed now will arrive in this same period and can satisfy Period_27 demand. Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit = $4/unit, so overstock is modestly penalized; better to match expected demand closely to avoid holding cost.\n\ne) Final order logic: Use recent 5-period average (\u224856) as a conservative forecast that balances the single spike and recent lower values. Order enough to meet expected demand but avoid large ending inventory. Therefore place order = 56 units (arrives this period to satisfy Period_27 demand).",
