No sustained upward or downward shift is evident\u2014variation looks normal. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0 but we have no concluded arrivals yet to confirm actual lead time; do NOT assume a change until we observe concluded arrivals. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Because arrivals (if actual lead time >0) will occur after decisions and we have no confirmed arrivals history, we must plan for serving current period demand from this order (promised L=0). e) Final order logic: Target roughly one period of expected demand. Given average \u224897 units and relatively low holding cost ($1) versus high profit ($19), ordering a round 100 units balances risk of lost sales against modest holding cost. This also keeps decisions simple while we gather arrival/lead-time signals in future concluded messages.",

Because lost sales cost (foregone profit $19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), under-ordering is costly. However excess inventory incurs $1 per unit holding cost for at least one period. e) Final order logic: Balance service level vs holding cost by targeting slightly above the recent average demand to avoid costly stockouts. Recent mean \u2248115 with variability; ordering a modest buffer of ~8\u201310% reduces stockout risk while keeping holding cost small. Therefore place an order of 125 units to cover expected demand this period while accepting small potential holding cost if demand is slightly below forecast.",
