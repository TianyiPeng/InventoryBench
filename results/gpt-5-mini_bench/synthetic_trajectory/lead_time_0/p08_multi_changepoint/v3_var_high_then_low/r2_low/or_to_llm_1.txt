  "rationale": "Context and data: Historical single-period demands: [71,120,95,116,82], mean \u03bc\u0304 = 96.8 units, sample std \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 21.18. Promised lead time L = 0 (so (L+1)=1 period coverage). Profit = $1, Holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so OR's base_stock \u2248 \u03bc\u0302 = 96.8. OR's cap calculation (using \u03a6\u22121(0.95)\u22481.645) yields a cap \u2248 132, so the OR-capped recommendation of 97 is consistent with the stats.\n\nInventory & lead-time considerations: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. There is no concluded arrival history yet, so no evidence that actual lead time differs from the promised L=0, nor evidence of lost shipments. Given holding cost equals profit, over-ordering is costly; we should avoid systematic overstock unless we have strong evidence of higher demand or delayed future arrivals. Conversely, under-ordering would cause lost sales this period because demand occurs after the decision and current on-hand is zero.\n\nDecision logic vs. OR: OR's recommendation (97) essentially targets expected single-period demand (\u03bc\u0304 \u2248 96.8) with no extra safety stock because q=0.5. With no confirmed lead-time issues, no recent regime shift in demand (only five samples with moderate variance), and symmetric cost structure, following the OR recommendation minimizes expected stockouts while avoiding extra holding cost.\n\nFinal strategy: Place order = 97 units to cover expected demand this period. Monitor arrivals and the next period's 'Period 1 conclude' message to confirm actual lead time and whether shipments are arriving as promised; if we observe delays or a sustained demand shift (3+ periods), we will adjust and record a carry-over insight.",

Period 1 conclude shows an order of 97 placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (arrived=97, lead_time=0 confirmed for that one observation). Orders in Period 2 with promised lead_time=0 will arrive during Period 2.\n- Historical demand data (samples provided): {71,120,95,116,82}. Empirical single-period mean \u03bc\u0304 = (71+120+95+116+82)/5 = 96.8 units.\n- OR recommendation: 101 units (OR uses promised L=0 and the capped base-stock calc). Given profit=1 and holding=1, the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so the OR baseline should target roughly the mean \xb1 cap adjustments; its 101 is slightly above the sample mean.\n- Demand signal: Period 1 experienced demand=120 but sales were capped at 97 due to stockout. This is one high-demand observation, not yet a sustained regime shift (needs 3+ consistent periods to record as carry-over). Therefore I will not materially increase safety stock based on a single spike.\nDecision logic and final action:\n- Current period demand will occur after my decision; with L=0 we can satisfy same-period demand if we order now. To cover expected demand while avoiding unnecessary holding cost (holding cost equals profit, so overstocks are as costly as lost sales), I choose to anchor to the empirical mean of ~96.8 and round to 97 units.\n- This reduces OR's 101 to 97 (a small 4-unit reduction) because the recent spike is not yet a sustained shift and the sample mean is a better central estimate. If repeated high demands appear in subsequent periods (\u22653 periods of higher demand), I will increase orders and record a carry-over insight.\n- Risk tradeoff: ordering 97 may still result in stockout if actual demand repeats at ~120, but given symmetric profit/holding and only one high observation, the conservative mean-based order minimizes expected holding penalties without ignoring demand history.\n",

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows Period 1 and Period 2 orders both arrived the same period they were ordered (arrived in P1 and P2 respectively), so actual observed lead time = 0 for those two periods. This matches the supplier's promised lead time; however we only have two confirmatory periods (need 3+ sustained periods to record as a carry-over insight). Step 2 \u2014 Demand & OR math check: Using the provided demand samples (71,120,95,116,82) the empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 = 96.8 and sample std dev \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 21.18. With promised L=0 the OR base-stock reduces to \u03bc\u0302 = 96.8 and safety factor z* = \u03a6\u22121(q) where q = profit/(profit+holding) = 1/(1+1)=0.5 \u2192 z*=0. So target base_stock \u2248 96.8. Current pipeline inventory (on-hand 7 + in-transit 0) = 7, so uncapped order \u2248 96.8 \u2212 7 = 89.8 \u2248 90. OR's capped policy produced a recommendation of 93 units (close to the uncapped figure here). Step 3 \u2014 Tactical judgement: Recent realized demands show some variability (120 then 90), but no sustained regime shift. Lead time appears to be 0, so we do not need extra pipeline coverage. Given profit equals holding cost (q=0.5) we should roughly target the mean demand and avoid systematically overstocking. Rounding the uncapped order to a whole unit, I place an order for 90 units \u2014 slightly below OR's 93 but consistent with the computed base-stock minus current pipeline (\u224890). This keeps expected coverage for the current period while limiting unnecessary holding cost.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time inference: Concluded messages for Periods 1\u20133 explicitly state arrived=(ordered on same Period) with lead_time=0 for each order (P1 order arrived in P1, P2 in P2, P3 in P3). That is 3 consecutive confirmations, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. Orders placed in Decision Phase of Period 4 will arrive during Period 4 and can satisfy Period 4 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so nothing available to satisfy Period 4 demand without placing an order now.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: Use the provided historical samples (chips: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82) \u2192 empirical mean \u2248 96.8 units/period and empirical std \u2248 21.2. Recent concluded sold quantities (97, 90, 97) are consistent with a roughly 95\u201397 mean when constrained by on-hand availability. No clear evidence of a regime shift or seasonality. Therefore forecast single-period demand \u2248 97 units.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 100 units using its capped base-stock. OR used promised lead time (0) and historical demand \u2014 its recommendation aligns with our estimate (\u224897). Given lead time confirmed as 0, no pipeline uncertainty to necessitate extra buffer beyond OR's safety cap. Profit= $1, Holding=$1 implies critical fractile q=0.5 \u2192 no extra z* safety stock in the base-stock formula, so ordering near mean is appropriate.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final decision and justification: Order 97 units (rounded to integer). Rationale: it matches the empirical single-period demand (~96.8) and minimizes holding cost risk while ensuring expected high fill rate because lead time is 0 (arrives same period). Ordering 97 units follows OR's intent while slightly trimming to the empirical mean to reduce expected end-of-period holding, given holding cost equals profit per unit. This balances profit per sold unit versus holding penalty.\n\nOperational note: Because lead time is 0, this order will arrive during Period 4 demand resolution and be available for sales this period. We will observe the arrival in Period 4 conclude (readable at Period 5 start) which will further confirm/adjust lead-time and demand assessments.",

Recent average demand = (120+90+102+72)/4 = 384/4 = 96 units/period.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time inference: Concluded history through Period 6 shows every order arrived in the same period it was placed (Period1\u2192arrived P1, P2\u2192P2, ... P6\u2192P6). Carry-over insight from Period 4 already recorded: actual lead time = 0 periods. Therefore orders placed now will arrive during the current period (but the arrival will be visible in the next period's conclude message).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 38, in-transit = 0. Historical realized demands (Periods 1\u20136) = [120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62]; mean = 93.83 units/period, showing substantial variability but no sustained upward or downward regime shift (last three: 72,117,62 \u2014 mixed). Product economics: profit = $1.0/unit and holding = $1.0/unit/period, so critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 safety factor z* = 0. Thus the risk-balanced base-stock equals the single-period mean demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation check: OR recommends 58 units. Recomputing base-stock with observed mean (\u224893.8) and L=0 gives base_stock \u224893.8. Pipeline inventory = on-hand + in-transit = 38. Uncapped order_raw \u2248 93.8 \u2212 38 = 55.8 (~56). OR applies a cap which produced 58; their recommendation is consistent with the same inputs and caps.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final decision and justification: I will follow the OR recommendation and order 58 units. With lead time = 0, the order will arrive during this period and immediately supplement on-hand to roughly 96 units (38 + 58), which matches the estimated single-period demand (~94) and balances the equal costs of stockouts and holding. Given demand volatility but no sustained regime shift and the symmetric cost structure (profit = holding), keeping inventory near the mean is appropriate. I prefer to follow OR's capped recommendation rather than trim it slightly because the cap helps smooth ordering variability and the small extra buffer (\u22482 units) reduces stockout risk without materially increasing expected holding cost.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk notes: If we observe three consecutive periods of demand below ~80 or above ~110, we should revisit and record a carry-over insight (demand regime shift).

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time inference: Concluded history (Periods 1\u20137) consistently shows orders arriving in the same period they were placed (arrived=ordered on same Period each time). Period 4 previously recorded the insight 'Lead time confirmed as 0 periods'; the full history through Period 7 continues to confirm lead time = 0. Therefore an order placed now will arrive during this period and can satisfy current-period demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, any order we place in Period 8 will arrive before demand is realized in Period 8 (arrival happens after decision but before demand). There are no overdue or lost shipments to account for.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand analysis: Use the most recent realized demands (Periods 1\u20137): [120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123]. Sum = 686, mean = 98.0 units per period. Demand shows variability but no sustained upward or downward shift requiring deviation from the sample mean. Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost per unit-period = $1, giving a critical fractile of 0.5; with symmetric profit/holding the cost-optimal choice is to order to the period demand median/mean to balance stockouts vs. holding.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Compare to OR recommendation: OR recommends 98 units. OR uses historical demand and promised lead time; here promised and actual lead time match (0), and the OR mean aligns with the observed mean (98). OR also applies a cap, but the recommended 98 is within sensible bounds.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final decision: Order 98 units. Rationale: With lead time = 0 the order will arrive in time for Period 8 demand; the recent seven-period average demand is 98 units; profit and holding costs are equal so ordering the mean minimizes expected lost profit from stockouts and excess holding cost from leftovers. This follows OR's recommendation unchanged because real observations validate OR assumptions and recommendation.\n\nRisk notes: Demand is somewhat volatile (range 62\u2013123). If signs of a sustained regime shift appear in future periods (\u22653 periods of consistent change), I will adjust beyond the OR baseline.\n",

Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so no coverage for the upcoming demand except by a same-period order. Demand analysis: Historical demands (P1\u2013P8) = [120, 90, 102, 72, 117, 62, 123, 122], sum = 808, sample mean \u2248 101.0. Recent periods (P6\u2013P8) are higher-variance but centered roughly around 102; there is no sustained multi-period regime shift requiring a permanent increase/decrease. OR recommendation: OR baseline recommends 100 units (capped base-stock using promised lead time). Given profit = $1 and holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so the theoretical base-stock equals the mean demand (no additional safety stock). Decision & adjustments: Because lead time is confirmed 0, the OR recommendation (100) aligns with the empirical mean (~101) and with the q=0.5 policy (no extra safety stock). On-hand+in-transit = 0, so ordering 100 will nearly match expected demand while avoiding extra holding cost (holding cost = profit so overstock is costly). I therefore follow the OR recommendation and order 100 units for Period 9.

Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so nothing will be available to meet Period 11 demand unless we order now. Demand analysis: Recent demand has been higher than early periods.

The OR baseline recommends 101 units (it uses historical mean/variance and a capped base-stock). Policy reasoning: With profit = holding cost, the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* \u2248 0, so the base-stock is essentially the (1+L)-period mean.

Rationale: lead time = 0 so we can meet expected-period demand immediately; with profit and holding equal (q=0.5) the risk-neutral base-stock equals mean demand (\u2248102). On-hand is 0 and pipeline is 0, so ordering 102 units targets expected demand and avoids overstock given holding cost equals profit. I keep the order close to OR's recommendation (OR suggested 101) but use the empirically computed mean (102) to slightly align to observed data.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk considerations: Because demand variance is moderate (std \u224819.5) and profit/holding are equal, increasing order above the mean would raise holding costs without improving expected reward. If future periods show a sustained increase/decrease (3+ periods), I will adjust and record a carry-over insight.\n",

There is no pipeline safety; the order we place now must cover Period 18 demand (and we won't be carrying visible arrivals from prior periods).\n\nDemand analysis: Historical demands for Periods 1\u201317 average \u2248102.3 units (sum 1739 over 17 periods). OR's base-stock/capped policy recommended 102 units, which aligns with that long-run average. However Period 17 demand jumped to 151 units (a +48% spike vs the 17-period mean). This is a single large observation; I do not have 3+ consecutive periods showing a sustained upward regime, so I will not record a carry-over insight.\n\nOR recommendation assessment: OR recommends 102 units (uses promised L=0 and full-history mean). Given confirmed L=0 that recommendation is appropriate for the long-run mean, but it would likely under-serve if the high demand seen in Period 17 persists or recurs in Period 18.\n\nDecision & quantity reasoning: Because lead time = 0, our order will immediately meet Period 18 demand. To balance the risk of stockout from the recent large spike against the equal profit and holding cost (profit = holding cost \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5, which implies no natural safety stock), I increase OR's recommendation moderately to provide some buffer for a possible repeat spike while avoiding excessive holding cost if demand reverts.

This should cover demand if it remains elevated somewhat above the historical mean, but limits downside holding cost if Period 17 was a one-off.\n\nRisk notes: If high demand persists for several periods, we should shift to a higher sustained order level; that would require observing 3+ periods of elevated demand before recording a carry-over insight and changing the baseline more aggressively.\n",

There is no in-transit inventory to account for.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Current inventory position: On-hand = 59, In-transit = 0. With L=0, the on-hand plus an immediate order would cover Period 35 demand; however ordering increases ending inventory and thus incurs holding cost for the remainder of the period.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook vs OR baseline: OR recommends 41 units. OR's policy (with profit = holding cost) effectively targets median demand; its cap further reduces ordering volatility. Recent demand has been variable: P31=0 (an outlier), P32=71, P33=107 (sold 97 due to stock limit), P34=42 \u2014 a 4-period average = 55. Many earlier periods show frequent >100 demands but those often coincided with purposeful larger orders; recent four-period evidence suggests demand near ~55 with spikes. Given holding cost = profit ($1), overstock is expensive (each extra unit held costs as much as its profit), so we should avoid unnecessary replenishment when inventory already covers expected demand.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Inventory policy decision: OR's recommendation (41) is lower than our current on-hand (59). Placing an order now would raise ending inventory and incur additional holding cost without strong evidence of a sustained, large upward shift in demand. Since lead time is 0, we can still react within the period if demand appears higher, but ordering preemptively when on-hand already exceeds OR's base-stock is not justified.\n\nFinal action: order 0 units for chips(Regular). This minimizes holding cost while on-hand 59 should cover the near-term expected demand (recent mean ~55). If large, sustained demand spikes reappear in the next 3+ periods, revise ordering upwards, but for now preserve cash and avoid extra holding costs.\n\nDecision tie to objectives: With Profit = $1 and Holding = $1, extra units held reduce net reward by $1 per unit per period; avoiding unnecessary replenishment improves long-run profit unless a clear, sustained demand increase is observed.\n",

The provided carry-over insight already records lead time = 0; I therefore treat actual lead time as 0. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so nothing will be available unless I order now; with lead_time=0 an order placed now will arrive in this period and can satisfy Period 36 demand. Demand analysis: Historical sample set (provided earlier: 71, 120, 95, 116, 82) implies a long-run single-period mean \u2248 96.8. The full history through Period 35 shows mostly single-period demand around ~100 with intermittent lows and occasional spikes. The last five concluded periods (P31\u2013P35) are: 0, 71, 107, 42, 256 \u2014 a large spike in Period 35 (256) appears to be an outlier rather than a new sustained regime because it is a single extreme observation and not part of a 3+ period pattern. Carry-over rule requires 3+ periods of consistent evidence to record a regime change, so I will not treat demand as permanently higher. OR recommendation comparison: OR (capped base-stock) suggests 104 units. With profit = holding cost ($1 each), the critical fractile is 0.5 (z*=0), so OR\u2019s base-stock is essentially the estimated mean; OR\u2019s cap smooths the order. Given zero lead time, on-hand=0, and OR using the historical mean, OR\u2019s 104 is a sensible, low-risk quantity. My risk trade-offs: Because holding cost equals profit, over-ordering is costly (each unsold unit incurs a full period holding cost equal to profit), so I avoid aggressive up-orders based on a single spike. However, because stockout cost is forgone profit and we have no inventory now, I don't want to under-order if demand repeats high. Rather than greatly exceed OR, I will accept OR\u2019s suggestion which balances expected sales and safety under equal profit/holding. Final decision: Follow OR recommendation and order 104 units. This arrives same period (lead time 0) and gives a good chance to meet typical demand while avoiding excessive holding cost from overstocking.

Orders placed in the decision phase arrive during the same period's arrival resolution, so an order now will be available to satisfy Period 38 demand. There are no in-transit units and on-hand = 0, so our order must cover expected demand for the current period.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & objective: Profit = $1 per sold unit and holding cost = $1 per unit-period. With symmetric unit profit and holding cost the critical fractile is 0.5 (median of demand). Over-ordering is as costly as under-ordering, so we should target a median/central estimate of one-period demand rather than inflate safety stock.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand analysis vs OR: OR recommends 104 units (base-stock capped policy using historical mean/variance and promised lead time). Recent realized demands (Periods 33\u201337) are: 107, 42, 256, 120, 115. These five recent observations have mean \u2248 128 and median = 115. The 256 in Period 35 is a strong single spike but not clearly sustained; however recent periods 36 and 37 are 120 and 115 (both above OR's 104). Given lead time = 0, we only need to cover one period of demand; using the recent median (115) matches the 0.5 fractile objective and protects against frequent stockouts observed when we followed lower orders.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision adjustment: Increase OR's recommendation from 104 to 115 to align with the recent demand median and the 0.5 optimal fractile under equal profit/holding costs. This raises the probability of meeting typical demand in the current period while avoiding excess expected holding cost relative to the value of sales.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Carry-over & conservatism: No new sustained regime change or lead-time insight to record (lead time was already confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over insight).

There are currently 0 units in-transit and on-hand = 27. With L=0, an order placed now will arrive in Period 42 before demand is realized, so it can cover Period 42 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: Recent demand has shifted upward compared with the very early sample set. Using the most recent 10 periods with activity (Periods 32\u201341): demands = [71,107,42,256,120,115,87,129,124,88], mean \u2248 113.9 units/period. The OR baseline (78) is using older assumptions and its cap \u2014 but recent realized demand has averaged ~114, so OR's recommendation underestimates current demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Profit/holding math & target inventory: Profit = $1, Holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 safety factor z*=0, so the risk-neutral base-stock is the expected demand for the (L+1)=1 period(s), i.e., target on-hand at start of demand should equal the single-period mean. With L=0 we want on-hand + arrival_this_period \u2248 expected single-period demand. Expected demand \u2248 114, current on-hand = 27, so order \u2248 114 \u2212 27 = 87 units. Ordering this gives close to the mean demand coverage while avoiding unnecessary excess that would incur holding costs equal to profit margin.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Reconcile with OR and finalize: OR's 78 is 9 units too low relative to the recent mean-based target; because lead time is 0 we can safely top up to meet expected demand without pipeline risk. I therefore order 87 units to bring available inventory near the recent-period mean demand.\n\nRisk notes: Demand has occasional spikes (e.g., Period 35 demand=256); this single extreme event is not treated as a sustained regime shift. Because holding cost equals profit, overstocking beyond expected demand is costly; we therefore target the recent mean rather than buffering heavily for rare spikes.

Because lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during this period (and be available to meet Period 44 demand), so the effective available inventory for Period 44 demand will be on-hand + order.\n\n3) Demand outlook: Recent realized demands are elevated relative to early-period samples. The last six periods (P38\u2013P43) demands: 87, 129, 124, 0? (P31 had 0 much earlier), specifically P38=87, P39=129, P40=124, P41=88, P42=96, P43=95 \u2192 recent average \u2248 103.

Given the OR baseline uses long-run historical stats but profit and holding cost are equal (profit = $1, holding = $1) the correct critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so the target inventory for the period should be approximately the single-period mean demand (~88 units).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory target & order calculation: With lead time = 0, ordered units arrive before demand.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 (carry-over insight from Period 4 and every concluded period shows same-period arrivals). Therefore an order placed now (Period 49) will arrive during Period 49 and can be used to satisfy Period 49 demand. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 33, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demands are volatile but center around roughly 80\u2013110 in many periods; the initial five-sample mean is ~97, and OR's capped baseline recommends 69 units. Given we are at Period 49 of 50, there is only one more decision opportunity (Period 50). Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), so excess ending inventory at the end of the horizon is doubly costly (it erodes the profit of units not sold). Strategy decision vs OR: OR's 69 would bring available inventory to 102 units (33 + 69). That likely covers demand but risks carrying extra into Period 50 if demand is lower. I reduce OR's recommendation modestly to 60 units to lean slightly conservative\u2014this yields available inventory of 93 units this period, close to the historical mean demand (~97) while limiting potential overstock that would incur terminal holding cost. This still provides reasonable chance to satisfy high demand this period but reduces expected ending inventory exposure. Action: order 60 units (arrive same period).",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history (Period 1\u201349) consistently shows orders arriving in the same period they were placed (multiple conclude lines: 'arrived ... lead_time was 0 periods'). Therefore actual lead time = 0 (matches the earlier carry-over insight). With L=0, orders placed now will arrive during this period's arrival resolution and can be used to satisfy Period 50 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory state: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. No pipeline to cover current demand, so we must order to cover Period 50 demand (and possibly some safety stock if warranted).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Historical demand for chips(Regular) has clustered around ~100 units with occasional spikes (examples: many periods with demand between ~100\u2013125, some low-demand periods and occasional large spikes). The small sample provided earlier (Periods 1\u20135) has mean \u224896.8; the long-run operational history the OR used produces a recommended order of 103.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Cost tradeoffs: Profit = $1/unit and Holding = $1/unit/period \u2192 critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5, implying minimal safety stock is optimal (median demand). Excess inventory is costly (holding cost equals profit), so avoid overstocking beyond near-term expected demand.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 OR recommendation & adjustment: OR recommends 103 units. Given confirmed L=0 (so immediate availability), current zero on-hand/pipeline, and the cost symmetry (profit=holding) implying little incentive to hold extra safety stock, following OR's recommendation is appropriate. The OR cap smooths swings and its 103 aligns with the recent modal demand level (~100). I therefore place an order of 103 units to meet expected Period 50 demand while avoiding unnecessary holding costs.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Implementation note for future periods: Monitor for sustained demand regime shifts or any future missed/late arrivals; if demand consistently falls or rises for 3+ periods, record a carry-over insight and adjust base-stock expectations accordingly.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR's recommendation of 103 units \u2014 lead time is confirmed 0 so order arrives in time, on-hand/pipeline are zero, and profit=holding discourages extra safety stock beyond expected ~100-unit demand.",
