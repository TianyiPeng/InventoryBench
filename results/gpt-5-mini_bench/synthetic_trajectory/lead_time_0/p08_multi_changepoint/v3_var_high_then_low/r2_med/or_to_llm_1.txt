Reproducing OR math: \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L)\xb7\u03bc\u0304 = 96.8; \u03c3\u0302 = \u221a(1+L)\xb7\u03c3\u0304 = 21.18; base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 96.8 + 0.842\xb721.18 \u2248 114.6.

Decision logic: We have no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time deviations (no conclude messages yet), and demand history shows moderate mean (~97) with substantial variance (\u03c3\u224821). Profit per unit ($4) is large relative to holding cost ($1), so the service-oriented base-stock level is appropriate. Ordering close to OR's recommendation balances expected sales and safety stock. Adjustment: follow OR recommendation (115 units) because it already incorporates demand variability and caps extreme swings; deviating downward risks stockouts and lost profit given high per-unit profit, while deviating upward would incur unnecessary holding cost without evidence of an upcoming surge. Implementation note: place order for 115 units now; arrivals will be observed only after their conclude message in future periods. Monitoring plan: if upcoming concluded arrivals show actual lead time \u2260 promised or repeated lost shipments, or if demand in the next 3+ periods shows a sustained shift, we will record a carry-over insight and change ordering accordingly.",

Historical sample mean = 96.8 units/period, sample std dev \u2248 21.2. Period 1 demand was 120 (sold 115 due to stockout), so last-period demand exceeded the long-run mean. OR's capped base-stock logic produced a recommendation of 119 units (close to my recalculated base-stock \u2248115). With lead time = 0, the order will arrive before demand this period, so ordering now directly replenishes for Period 2 demand.\n\nDecision and adjustment: I increase OR's recommendation very slightly from 119 to 120 units to directly cover the observed high demand in Period 1 (120) and avoid another stockout. This is a small, targeted upward tweak rather than a regime-change response \u2014 there is no sustained multi-period signal to justify a larger adjustment or to record a carry-over insight.

{
  "rationale": "1) Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows Period 1 and Period 2 orders both arrived with lead_time=0 (arrived same period they were ordered).

Empirical mean \u2248 96.8 units/period, sample std \u2248 21.2. With promised L=0, OR computes \u03bc\u0302=96.8, \u03c3\u0302=21.2.

OR raw order = base_stock \u2212 pipeline = ~84.6 units. OR applies a cap and returns 86 units (consistent with rounding).\n\n4) Judgment vs OR: Observed recent demands (Period1 sold 115, Period2 sold 90) are in line with the ~97 mean and occasional spikes to ~120; given profit>holding (4 vs 1) the policy favors stocking to avoid lost sales. Also, actual lead time appears to be 0 so orders placed now will arrive in time for Period 3 demand. There is no evidence of lost shipments or regime shift requiring deviation from OR recommendation.\n\n5) Action decision: Follow the OR recommendation of 86 units. This brings on-hand+order to ~116 units available for the current period (30 on-hand + 86 arriving same period), close to the base-stock level of ~115 and balanced between stockout risk and holding cost.\n\nFinal: order 86 units for chips(Regular).",

With lead time = 0, ordering to the base-stock is appropriate: it targets expected demand plus safety stock tuned to profit vs. holding cost, balancing lost-sales cost (foregone profit) against holding cost. Current on-hand is low (14), so ordering OR's 101 brings available inventory to ~115, which covers higher-end demand realizations while not over-stocking excessively given the 4:1 profit-to-holding ratio.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision: I follow the OR recommendation and order 101 units.

Therefore orders placed now will arrive during the current period's arrival resolution and can be used to satisfy this period's demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Use observed demand history (Periods 1\u20135) which yields an empirical mean \u2248 96.8 and sample std dev \u2248 21.2 (these are the same inputs OR used).

Ordering 115 balances expected sales (~100) with safety stock (~15) to reduce stockouts while accepting modest expected holding cost.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk notes: If in subsequent periods we see a clear sustained shift in demand or missed arrivals (lost shipments), I will adjust orders accordingly.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). There are no in-transit units and on-hand = 0, so an order placed now will be available to meet Period 8 demand. No lost shipments are apparent.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: Historical demand samples provided (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) give mean \u03bc\u0304 = 96.8 and sample std \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 21.18. Recent realized demand (Periods 5\u20137 = 117, 62, 123) shows variability but no sustained regime shift (only three periods, not a consistent change). Seasonality/calendar not indicated. I therefore treat the OR's i.i.d. estimate as broadly appropriate.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR baseline check: OR recommends 117 units. Recomputing the OR logic with L=0: \u03bc\u0302 = 96.8, \u03c3\u0302 \u2248 21.18, z*\u22480.842 \u2192 base_stock \u2248 114.6. The OR cap (~131.7) does not bind, so OR's 117 is close to the uncapped base stock.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Inventory & cost tradeoffs: With lead time 0, we can order to match single-period demand. Profit = $4, holding = $1 yields critical fractile q=0.8 (consistent with OR). Holding cost is material, so avoid large overstock beyond the safety target. Given observed variability (occasionally >120), but no sustained upward shift, a small conservative rounding down from OR (117 \u2192 115) reduces expected holding cost while still providing safety stock near the computed base_stock (~115).\n\nFinal strategy: Order 115 units for Period 8. This matches the statistical base-stock (\u2248115) while slightly trimming OR's 117 to reduce holding exposure.

Given actual observed lead time = 0 and recent demand mean ~102 with moderate variability (\u03c3\u224823), the base-stock target of ~121 is reasonable to hold through the period while achieving the desired service level (q=0.8).\n7) Tradeoff vs holding cost: holding cost is $1/unit/period (not negligible) but profit margin is $4, so the fractile already accounts for this. Because lead time = 0, we do not need extra pipeline coverage beyond current period; ordering up to base_stock is appropriate.\nFinal decision: place order to raise inventory to the base-stock target (rounded to nearest whole unit). Therefore order = 111 units (base_stock \u2212 on-hand = 121 \u2212 10 \u2248 111).

Recent realized demand (Periods 1\u201310) averages 102.8 units/period with sample std \u2248 21.5. With lead time L=0 we need to cover one period of demand plus safety stock.

Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so all of Period 18's expected demand must be satisfied by an order placed now (or will be lost sales). Demand analysis: Recent realized demand (Periods 13\u201317) = [81, 120, 102, 58, 151], mean = 102.4 units; demand is variable with occasional spikes (151 in P17) but no sustained new regime above this range (last 5-period average \u2248102). OR baseline: OR recommends 121 units. OR uses earlier 5-sample training and a safety factor (critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/5 = 0.8) that yields higher safety stock. Adjustment rationale: Because lead time is 0, we can respond immediately to demand each period and therefore do not need large pipeline coverage. Holding cost is substantial relative to profit (holding $1 vs profit $4), so excess ending inventory is penalized. I therefore trim OR's 121 down toward the recent realized mean while keeping a small safety buffer for variability and the recent spike in P17.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history shows a sustained pattern of same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed earlier and reinforced across periods 1\u201321). With L=0, an order placed now will arrive during Period 22 before demand is realized, so we can use ordered units to satisfy current-period demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate: Using full observed history (Periods 1\u201321) demand avg \u2248 103.5 units per period (sum=2173 over 21 periods). Variability is moderate (std on the order of ~20 units), consistent with observed ups and downs including occasional spikes (e.g., Period 17=151).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory position: On-hand = 18, in-transit = 0. Because L=0, pipeline that matters for this period is essentially 0 until we place an order now. To meet expected single-period demand (~103.5) we need roughly 103.5 \u2212 18 \u2248 85.5 units.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Compare to OR: OR's capped recommendation is 103 units (close to the single-period mean). OR likely assumes ordering to replace a full single-period mean without adjusting for current on-hand. Given on-hand=18, matching OR's 103 as the order quantity would produce a very large ending inventory (>100) if demand is below mean. To balance selling more versus holding costs, order should top up to expected demand rather than duplicate it.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision and tradeoffs: Profit per unit ($4) exceeds holding cost per period ($1), which motivates stocking enough to capture likely sales; but holding cost is non-negligible so we avoid large overstock.

Current recent demand across many periods has averaged near 100 units; base-stock around 115 implies we should hold one period's expected demand plus safety stock. Given on-hand=3 (very low) and profit >> holding (favor stocking to avoid lost sales), I will place an order close to the computed order_raw but not as high as OR's 118 to avoid unnecessary holding cost from overstocking.

With lead time = 0 we can respond immediately next period, so we do not need large pipeline cover for multi-period uncertainty.\n\nOR recommendation: OR recommends ordering 62 using its capped base-stock calculation (it uses historical data and promised lead time). OR's suggestion aims to cover mean demand plus safety stock (it uses q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/(4+1) = 0.8 \u2192 z \u2248 0.84).

  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history through Period 29 shows every order arrived in the same period it was placed (Period 1\u201329 conclude messages all report lead_time=0). Therefore actual lead time = 0 and orders placed now will arrive during the current period's arrival resolution and be available for Period 30 demand. Inventory state: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Demand evidence: Full history (Periods 1\u201329) shows a single-period demand mean around ~100\u2013120 with substantial volatility and occasional large spikes (notably Period 29 demand=156, Period 25 demand=143, Period 17 demand=151). Recent periods include several high-demand episodes causing stockouts when inventory was insufficient (e.g., Period 29 sold 121 vs demand 156, leaving unmet demand). OR recommendation: OR baseline suggests ordering 124 units using promised lead time and historical samples; it caps large orders but targets a service level consistent with profit/holding tradeoff (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/5 = 0.8 \u2192 z\u22480.84). Adjustment reasoning: Because lead time = 0, any extra units ordered arrive immediately and can prevent stockouts this period without incurring multi-period holding cost exposure. Given the recent high-demand spikes (especially Period 29 = 156) and the severe cost of lost sales (profit $4 per sold unit), I tilt toward slightly higher coverage than OR's 124 to reduce stockouts in this period. Holding cost is only $1/unit/period, so adding buffer has a favorable marginal expected return given the recent volatility. I choose an order of 140 units: this is +16 units (+13%) above OR's 124 and still conservative relative to the biggest observed spike (156). With lead time 0, those 140 units will arrive this period and maximize expected profit \xd7 units_sold while limiting one-period holding cost if demand is below forecast. Implementation note: Continue to monitor next period concludes for any change in lead time or sustained demand regime shifts; if spikes persist for multiple periods, consider increasing base-stock more permanently.

Inventory position: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so we must order to cover immediate-period demand. Demand assessment: recent demand has risen relative to early-run levels. Looking at the most recent 5 periods (P26\u2013P30) demands = [83, 121, 107, 156, 150], mean \u2248 123.4 units; the full-horizon historical mean is near ~100\u2013120 but the last two periods were notably high (156,150). OR recommendation: 126 units. OR uses promised lead time and full history; its base-stock cap produced 126, which sits very close to my short-term demand estimate (~123). Strategy justification: with lead time = 0, we can be responsive each period and thus should not over-order large safety stock \u2014 holding cost = $1/unit/period is material relative to profit.

Therefore any order placed now will arrive before demand in Period 32.\n\nInventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 126, in-transit = 0. I inspected recent realized single-period demand over the last 10 periods (P22\u2013P31): [100, 57, 83, 143, 83, 121, 107, 156, 150, 0] with sum = 1000 and mean = 100 units. Historical demand is variable with occasional spikes (156, 150) but the 0 in P31 appears to be a single-period anomaly, not a sustained regime shift. Given the confirmed 0-period lead time, we can top up immediately if needed, but ordering incurs a $1/period holding cost per unit while each additional sold unit yields $4 profit.\n\nOR recommendation reconciliation: OR recommends ordering 2 units (it uses promised lead time and historical samples). With on-hand = 126 which already exceeds the recent 10-period average demand (~100) and is near or above many typical period demands, the marginal benefit of ordering 2 units is negligible relative to holding cost. Because lead time = 0, we could order later in the period if demand materializes, but we must decide now; ordering a small positive quantity gives little added protection vs. the holding cost.\n\nFinal decision: place 0-unit order this period. Rationale summary: confirmed same-period arrivals mean we can react in-period if demand surges, current on-hand (126) comfortably exceeds recent average demand (~100), and the recent zero-demand period is not a sustained regime shift\u2014so avoid extra holding cost and do not increase OR's tiny recommendation.

The carry-over insight already recorded lead time = 0 (confirmed). Therefore an order placed now will arrive during this period and can be used to satisfy Period 33 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate from available historical samples: The small sample set provided to OR (and the explicit 5-sample series) is: {71, 120, 95, 116, 82}. Empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 = (71+120+95+116+82)/5 = 96.8 units. Sample std dev \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 21.19 units.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR baseline check: OR recommended 72 units. OR's methodology (base-stock with safety factor z*\u2248\u03a6\u22121(0.8)=0.842) implies a target base-stock around \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 96.8 + 0.842\xd721.19 \u2248 114.6 units.

OR's final 72 is higher than that uncapped calculation (OR also applies a cap and uses all history; their cap here is permissive).\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Inventory arithmetic & policy decision: With lead time = 0, ordered units arrive during Period 33 and will be available for demand this period. Expected demand \u2248 96.8 units. Current on-hand = 55, so ordering \u2248 42 units would cover the mean demand but gives negligible safety stock. Given profit ($4) > holding cost ($1), we want positive safety stock to avoid forgone sales. The base-stock calculation implies total available target \u2248 115 units; that means ordering \u2248 60 units now.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final action choice and justification: I order 60 units (rounded from ~59.6). This aligns with the computed base-stock target (\u2248115 total inventory), provides a reasonable safety buffer against variability (\u03c3 \u2248 21), and is slightly more conservative than the bare mean-cover order (\u224842). It is slightly lower than OR's 72 recommendation but matches the base-stock arithmetic when using the observed on-hand and confirmed lead time. Ordering 60 balances expected profit from sales (higher service) against holding cost from excess inventory.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk & operational notes: If upcoming periods show a sustained increase in demand (3+ periods), or if we observe any shipments not concluding (lost shipments), I will record a carry-over insight and adjust orders upward. For now, no new sustained signal is detected.\n",

With L=0 and no pipeline, the OR recommendation must be relied on to replenish stock that will meet current-period demand.\n- Demand outlook: Historical demand is variable but often in the 100\u2013140 range with occasional spikes (e.g., Periods 29\u201330: 156,150). Recent five-period demand (P29\u2013P33): 156, 150, 0, 71, 107 \u2014 volatility exists but large positive demand realizations are common.

The critical fractile favors stocking (q=0.8). Understocking misses profitable sales (high opportunity cost) while an extra unit held costs only $1 this period. Given frequent high demands and low on-hand (8), erring toward OR's higher recommendation protects sales and overall profit.\n- OR limitations considered: OR used promised lead time (0) and historical samples; it does not account for regime shifts. I checked for sustained regime change: demand has spikes but not a stable shift for 3+ periods\u2014so no carry-over update.\nFinal decision logic:\n- Follow OR recommendation of 119 units because: (1) lead time is confirmed 0 so ordered units will be available this period, (2) on-hand is only 8 and recent history shows many periods with demand >100 so a 119 order replenishes to a near base-stock level, (3) profit margin ($4) justifies stocking to avoid lost sales despite holding cost $1.

Therefore actual lead time = 0 and orders placed now will arrive during this period and can satisfy current-period demand.\n\nInventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 85, in-transit = 0. Recent single-period demands (Periods 30\u201334) were: 150, 0, 71, 107, 42 with a 5-period average \u2248 74 units and very high variance. The longer-run history centers around roughly 90\u2013120 in many periods but with frequent spikes and occasional very low periods. Because lead time = 0, we only need to cover this period's demand with on-hand + today's order.\n\nOR recommendation review: OR recommends ordering 41 units. That baseline uses promised lead time and historical averages; it aims to top up pipeline to a base-stock but is capped. With lead time = 0, ordering 41 would raise available inventory to 126 (85+41) before demand. Given expected single-period demand \u224874 (recent mean) and the holding cost being non-trivial ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($4/unit), carrying extra inventory above what we expect to sell increases holding cost without much benefit. We should keep inventory lean but avoid stockouts when near-average demand occurs.\n\nDecision: Do not order this period (order = 0). Rationale: On-hand 85 already exceeds the recent 5-period average single-period demand (~74) and provides buffer against typical variance; because orders arrive immediately, we can react next period if demand spikes. This reduces unnecessary holding costs while retaining flexibility to place same-period replenishment if demand picks up. If next period shows a sustained upward shift (several periods of higher demand), I will increase order sizes to restore a higher base stock.\n\nSummary of adjustments vs OR: I lowered OR's 41 \u2192 0 because current on-hand already covers expected demand this period and lead time = 0 allows reactive ordering, so ordering now only increases holding cost with limited benefit.",

The OR baseline recommends 137 using the capped base-stock method (which assumes promised lead time and historical average). Assessment vs. OR: OR's 137 is reasonable for typical demand regimes observed across many periods, but last period's extreme demand (256) suggests elevated risk of a stockout if demand repeats.

The initial five-sample mean (~97) and the richer period history point to an expected single-period demand near ~100\u2013120. Profit per unit = $4 and holding cost = $1, so the critical fractile q = 4/(4+1) = 0.8 (z \u2248 0.84). That favors carrying safety stock to avoid stockouts because lost sales are relatively expensive vs holding.\n\nOR recommendation: OR suggests ordering 77 units. OR uses promised lead time and historical samples; it produces a base-stock/capped order without seeing our confirmed lead-time = 0. With on-hand = 60, OR's 77 would result in ~137 available this period if delivered immediately.\n\nMy decision logic and final quantity: Because lead time is confirmed 0, we only need to cover this single upcoming period's demand (L+1 = 1). I target available inventory \u2248 120 units to align with the empirical recent demand central tendency and to provide a modest safety buffer given the high profit/higher stockout cost. With 60 on-hand, ordering 60 units brings available inventory to ~120. Ordering substantially more (e.g., matching OR's 77 or higher) would increase holding cost exposure without much additional stockout protection for a single-period horizon. Ordering much less risks a stockout given frequent demands >100.\n\nTherefore I order 60 units. This choice: (a) uses the confirmed zero lead time so the order immediately covers Period 37 demand, (b) targets an available level (~120) near observed recent demand, and (c) balances profit vs holding cost (q=0.8) conservatively by not overstocking beyond what recent history suggests is needed for one period.\n\nOperational notes: If we observe several consecutive future periods of sustained higher demand (\u2265 +30% for 3+ periods), I will record a carry-over insight and increase base targets; conversely, if demand falls consistently, I will scale orders down. No new carry-over insight is recorded now because the confirmed lead-time = 0 was already captured at Period 6 and current demand variability is not a sustained regime shift of 3+ periods.",

The OR recommendation is 130 (it uses longer history and its cap). \n\nDemand & risk calculation: Using the original small-sample history (Periods 1\u20135) gives mean \u03bc\u0304 \u2248 96.8 and sample std \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 21.2; with profit=4 and holding=1 the critical fractile q=4/5=0.8 \u2192 z*\u22480.842.

However, holding cost is significant (1 per unit) and lead time = 0 (so we can replenish again within the same period if we over-order in future), so we should avoid matching OR\u2019s full 130 which assumes more conservative service. \n\nFinal decision: place an order of 108 units (rounded from order_raw \u2248107.6, nudged up modestly toward recent-demand evidence).

Demand analysis: Recent realized demand has been volatile but the last five concluded demands (Periods 36\u201340) are 120, 115, 87, 129, 124 with a 5-period average of 115 and moderate variation.

Given lead_time=0 (confirmed) and current zero on-hand, OR's recommendation is a reasonable starting point. Adjustment decision: I reduce OR's 137 to 125 units. Rationale for reduction: (1) Recent recent-period mean demand (~115) is materially below OR's recommendation, so ordering the full 137 would add ~22 units of expected extra inventory, increasing holding cost ($1/unit/period) without proportionate expected additional profit (profit per unit = $4). (2) With same-period delivery (lead_time=0) we can react next period to demand changes, so we do not need as large a forward safety buffer. (3) There is no sustained regime shift or confirmed seasonal event requiring larger safety stock.

Strategy: Order 87 units to bring available inventory for this period up to \u2248115 (28 on-hand + 87 arriving), which balances expected demand (~97) and safety stock (\u224818) while avoiding excessive holding cost late in the horizon.

  "rationale": "Summary of facts and inference: Promised lead time = 0 and prior carry-over insight (Period 6) confirmed actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). Current on-hand = 41, in-transit = 0, and orders placed now will arrive within the same period's arrival resolution (but visible in the conclude message next period). With lead time = 0 we only need to cover one period of demand when ordering now (L+1 = 1). Demand evidence: recent five-period demands (Periods 42\u201346) = [96, 95, 104, 69, 74], average = 87.6 units; this is a good short-term forecast because lead time is zero and demand appears variable but centered near ~88. OR recommended 92 units (using its capped base-stock logic), which is close to the recent mean but does not account for the remaining short horizon and the fact we can replenish every period with same-period arrivals. Decision logic: with a high profit-to-holding ratio (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.8, z\u22480.84), safety stock is valuable, but because lead time is zero we can avoid tying up inventory across multiple periods and instead replenish each period to meet expected single-period demand. Also we are late in the horizon (Period 47 of 50), so excess inventory across remaining periods can incur holding cost without offsetting future sales. Calculation and final order: target single-period demand \u2248 88 units. To avoid stockouts this period, we need order = max(0, target - on-hand) = 88 \u2212 41 = 47. I add a modest 10% buffer to reflect demand variability and the 0.84 z-value (and because stockouts immediately for this SKU are costly), giving 47 \xd7 1.10 \u2248 52 units. This is well below OR's 92 because OR effectively plans higher pipeline coverage; with confirmed zero lead time and frequent replenishment possible, we do not need that much pipeline. Operationally: place order of 52 units. Expectation: arrival same period, on-hand after arrival \u2248 93; expected sales ~88, leaving small residual inventory to cover variability but limiting holding costs over the remaining horizon. Explanation of deviation from OR: reduced OR's 92 \u2192 52 because (a) actual lead time = 0 enables lean, period-by-period replenishment, (b) recent realized mean demand \u224888, and (c) short remaining horizon makes avoiding excess inventory prudent.

Period 48 (Period_48) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time and arrivals: Concluded-history shows repeated evidence that actual lead time = 0 (Period 1\u201347 all arrivals same period as ordered; carry-over insight already recorded at Period 6). That means orders placed now will arrive before demand in the same period (arrival happens during the period after decision but before demand). Because lead time = 0 and there is no in-transit inventory, we can safely replenish each period just to cover the upcoming period's demand plus modest safety stock.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & recent demand: Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Recent demand (Periods 43\u201347) = [95, 104, 69, 74, 96], 5-period average \u2248 87.6 units, with short-term variation (std \u2248 ~13\u201315). Longer history includes occasional large spikes (e.g., 150+, 256), but those are intermittent and not part of a sustained regime shift.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation review: OR recommends 133 units using its capped base-stock. OR uses historical samples and promised lead time; its suggestion is conservative. Given actual lead time = 0 (able to react each period) and no pipeline, we do not need the larger OR order to cover multiple periods of uncertainty.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision logic and trade-offs: Profit = $4, holding cost = $1, giving critical fractile q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 (z*\u22480.84). OR's higher recommendation trades stockouts for fewer replenishments, which makes sense under positive lead time. With lead time = 0 we prefer to reduce on-hand exposure because holding cost accrues per period and we can top up next period if demand surprises. Using the recent demand average (\u224888) plus a modest safety buffer to cover normal variation but avoid carrying too much, a one-period order of 100 units is appropriate: it covers typical demand, gives ~12 units safety vs recent mean, and keeps holding costs low.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final strategy: Order 100 units this period. Rationale: reduces OR's 133 to 100 because same-period replenishment capability lets us replenish frequently, recent realized demand is substantially below OR's recommendation, and avoiding excess holding cost improves expected objective when lead time = 0. Monitor incoming demand next periods \u2014 if we see a sustained increase (3+ periods) or a pattern of larger spikes, escalate order size and record a new carry-over insight.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk & monitoring: If demand spikes again for multiple periods (3+ sustained periods above our protection level), we'll revise upward and record a carry-over insight. If any orders stop concluding (lost shipments) or lead time evidence changes, we'll override and adjust pipeline targets accordingly.",

Demand outlook: use the historical sample set provided for the OR baseline (71, 120, 95, 116, 82) which has mean \u224896.8 and sample std \u224821.2.

There are occasional spikes (e.g., P35 demand=256, P29=156, P30=150) but these are intermittent.

OR uses promised lead time (0) and historical demand; that aligns with our confirmed lead time and with the recent demand center.
