Average = 96.8 units/period. Variation exists but no sustained regime shift is evident from these five samples.\nc) Lead time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0, but we have no concluded arrivals yet to confirm actual lead time. Per rules, we cannot infer lead-time until we see a 'conclude' arrival. Therefore we must plan conservatively assuming the arrival may not be instant; however promised 0 suggests arrivals could be same-period. Given uncertainty, do not rely on future confirmations.\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Current period demand will occur after placing this order; orders may arrive during this period only if actual lead time = 0, which is unconfirmed. To avoid stockout (which forgoes profitable sales of $4/unit) while limiting holding cost ($1/unit/period), target expected demand for one period plus minimal rounding.\ne) Final order logic: Use the historical average demand ~97 units as the best single-period forecast. Ordering ~97 balances capturing expected profitable sales (profit $4) while avoiding excessive holding cost ($1 per unit) from overstock. Since lead time is uncertain, this order aims to cover the current period demand; we will update future orders after observing 'conclude' messages to infer actual lead time.\n",

Recent history shows a stable elevated regime since P36 (excluding the one-off extreme at P35=256 and P31=0 which appear episodic). c) Lead time / missing orders: Historical conclude messages (many periods) show that orders arrive in the same period they are ordered. Prior carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods. No in-transit or overdue orders now. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no stock to meet Period_41 demand unless we order now. Holding cost = $1/unit/period; profit = $4/unit sold. With lead time=0, an order placed now can satisfy Period_41 demand. e) Final order logic: Target to satisfy expected demand while limiting excess inventory because holding cost reduces next-period reward. Recent mean demand ~115; to provide slight buffer for variability I round up modestly but avoid large overstock from outliers. Therefore place an order of 120 units (arrives this period) to serve expected demand and capture profitable sales while keeping ending inventory risk modest.",
