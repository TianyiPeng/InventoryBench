Product is a staple (chips) with no obvious seasonal drivers in the observation.\n\nb) Demand regime analysis: Use the provided historical samples for chips(Regular): Period_1:84, P2:55, P3:79, P4:85, P5:126. The 5-period average is 85.8 units/period with moderate variability (min 55, max 126). With no evidence of a regime shift and no calendar spike, the best unbiased forecast for the current period is approximately 86 units.\n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time is unknown. There is no concluded arrival history to confirm actual lead time, so orders placed now may either arrive same period or be delayed/lost. Because we have no evidence of delays yet, we cannot infer a lead-time change.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Current period demand will occur after the decision; since expected demand \u224886 and there is no inventory/pipeline coverage, we should order to cover expected demand. Profit per unit ($4) is large relative to holding cost ($1/period), so the cost of understock (lost profit) is higher than the cost of a modest overstock carrying one period.\n\ne) Final order logic: Order to cover the forecasted current-period demand (~86 units). This balances maximizing profit (serve demand) against holding cost risk given limited info on lead time. If future periods show delayed arrivals or order loss, adapt and record lead-time insights then.",

The short-run mean over the last three observed full-demand periods (P2\u2013P4) is (86+62+80)/3 = 76.0 units; the recent max observed demand is 86. There is some variability but no sustained regime shift (only 4 periods observed). The separate historical sample list (Period_5:126) is part of background training data but the realized recent on-site demand does not confirm a sustained jump.\n\nc) Lead time / orders: Concluded messages for multiple periods (Periods 1\u20134) show orders arriving in the same period they were ordered. Period 2 capture already recorded lead time = 0; subsequent arrivals (P3,P4) are consistent with 0 lead time.

Using recent observations, the safe target is near the recent high (86) to cover demand spikes observed in the near past while avoiding excessive overstock. Therefore place an order to bring available inventory to cover approximately 86 units of expected demand. Since on-hand + in-transit = 0 and lead time = 0, place an order for 86 units.\n",
