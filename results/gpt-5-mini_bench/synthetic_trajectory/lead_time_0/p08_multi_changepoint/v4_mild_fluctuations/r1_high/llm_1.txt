Per instructions we must not infer lead-time from lack of arrivals. With no evidence, we assume the promised 0-day lead time but remain cautious in future periods. Orders placed now will arrive during the same period if actual lead_time=0; if actual lead_time\u22651 they will not arrive in time for this period's demand.\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0, so nothing available to meet Period_1 demand unless order arrives this period. Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit \u2014 stocking to satisfy forecast demand yields high expected net benefit, and modest overstock has limited holding penalty.\ne) Final order logic: Target serving expected Period_1 demand \u224886 units.

Period 1 actual demand observed was 98 but sales were capped at 86 due to stockout, indicating true demand may be >=86 this location. With only one stockout observation we cannot conclude a sustained upward shift. c) Lead time / missing orders: Period 1 order (86) arrived in Period 1 with lead_time = 0 (conclude message: ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 0). This is a single-period observation and not yet a multi-period sustained change; however, it means an order placed now will arrive in the same period and can satisfy Period 2 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. No overdue shipments. e) Final order logic: Given high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), it is preferable to satisfy probable demand rather than risk lost sales. Using the sample-series mean (~86) and the observed stockout (implying true demand may be modestly higher), I place an order to cover slightly above the historical mean to reduce chance of another stockout while keeping holding costs modest.

Recent observed concluded arrivals/orders indicate normal variability around ~75\u201385 with P1 spike to 98 and P2 drop to 62. A reasonable short-term forecast for Period 3 demand is ~75\u201385; using the provided sample P3=79 is consistent.\n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Concluded messages show orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 arrived in the same period (arrived=ordered, lead_time was 0 periods). Therefore actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods. No in-transit shipments or lost orders present.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 28, in-transit = 0.

Periods 24\u201326 (169,167,168) established a sustained higher-demand regime, but Periods 27\u201328 dropped, so there is uncertainty whether the high regime continues. Given the confirmed previous regime shift (Periods 24\u201326) and still-elevated multi-period average, I bias toward provisioning for above-baseline demand.\n\nc) Lead time / orders: Carry-over insight shows lead time confirmed as 0 periods. History of concluded arrivals consistently shows promised 0 = actual 0, and there are currently no in-transit units.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 91, in-transit = 0.

P27\u2013P29 = 111,77,109 (more moderate/variable).

Covering the recent high spike (up to ~168) would require ~117 additional units (168 - 51). Covering a moderate expectation (~110\u2013115) requires ~60\u201365 units.
