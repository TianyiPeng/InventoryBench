Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [84,55,79,85,126] (mean=85.8, std\u224822.9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and there are no 'conclude' messages to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Promised lead time is used (no evidence to change). Because profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1), the OR backend will target roughly the mean demand (service quantile ~50%), so using defaults keeps the base-stock close to the historical mean while avoiding overreaction in this first period. I set L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to defaults so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples and applies its capped ordering rule. This balances service level vs holding cost given limited information and no observed delays.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision: last conclude (Period_1) shows an order of 86 arrived in-period with observed lead_time=0. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (used for forecasting) show mean \u224885.8 and moderate volatility. No evidence of lost or delayed shipments yet (single conclude with lead_time=0). I use default lead time (promised L=0) because the only concluded lead-time observation confirms 0 and there is insufficient evidence to change it. For demand and risk I select the defaults so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) using the full sample set; this leverages all available data rather than overfitting to a single-period spike and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). If future concludes show delays or sustained demand shifts I will switch to a recent_N or explicit forecast.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision: on-hand=26, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-2 arrived with lead_time=0 (two confirmations), so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Use conservative, simple defaults so OR backend uses full sample history for forecasting. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (observed consistent); mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all provided demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost. This keeps orders responsive to the historical demand pattern while avoiding overcommitment given current modest on-hand and zero in-transit inventory.

Daily Profit: $68.00, Daily Holding Cost: $17.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand = 17, in-transit = 0. Concluded history (Periods 1-3) shows all three past orders arrived with lead_time = 0 periods (orders placed in P1-P3 arrived same period). Promised lead time = 0 and observed lead time samples support it, so use default lead time. No clear recent demand regime shift: historical demand samples provided (84,55,79,85,126) will be used by backend default calculations. Given profit = holding = $1, the critical ratio = 0.5 implies moderate service-level; using backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) lets the OR engine compute the base-stock and capped order appropriately. No evidence of lost shipments or sustained changepoint (only three concluded arrivals all with lead_time 0), so stick to defaults to avoid over-reacting and to balance service vs. holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent concluded history (Periods 1-4) shows all arrivals occurring same period as order (lead_time=0 consistently). Demand samples available (Periods 1-5) show no sustained regime change\u2014recent demands vary but not persistently higher or lower. Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we need to replenish to cover this period's demand; because lead time is confirmed as 0, orders will arrive same period and the OR backend's default base-stock calculation ((1+L)\xd7mean) is appropriate. I therefore use default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and no evidence of changed demand or lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3, P4 arrived P4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $84.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 decision. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 (P1\u2013P5 orders all arrived same period). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover this period's demand with an order that, if placed now, will arrive in the same period. Use default estimators anchored to all observed demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 concluded: demands = [98, 62, 68, 96, 84]; mean = 81.6, sample std \u2248 16.21). Promised lead time is 0 and evidence is consistent (5/5 arrivals same period), so choose L=default to let backend use promised lead time. Use mu_hat=default to set (1+L)*mean = 81.6 as the demand forecast across review+lead period. Use sigma_hat=default so volatility = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 16.21. This choice is conservative given profit = holding cost ($1 vs $1) which implies a 50% critical ratio; defaults give the OR engine the appropriate base-stock balancing service level and holding cost while leveraging the confirmed 0-period lead time and the full historical demand sample.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 context: on-hand=28, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and lead time confirmed as 0 in carry-over (P1\u2013P6 arrivals matched same period). Recent concluded demands (periods 1\u20136) show variable weekly demand (98, 62, 68, 96, 84, 56) with no sustained upward or downward shift; therefore I will use the backend defaults so it uses the full-sample mean/variance and the promised lead time. Using default L keeps the OR engine aware that orders arrive same period; default mu_hat/sigma_hat instruct the engine to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances target service level (profit=holding cost so q=0.5) with holding costs. With on-hand=28 and no in-transit, this choice lets the OR engine decide an order to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the computed base_stock while capping order size to limit stock buildup given equal profit/holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. History shows every concluded order from Periods 1\u20137 arrived same period (arrived reported in the same Period conclude messages), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0 \u2014 consistent with the carry-over insight from Period 5. Product economics: profit = $1.0, holding = $1.0 \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so base-stock reduces to mu_hat. Given no recent sustained demand regime change (demand has varied but no multi-period shift >=3 periods), I will use the default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps ordering targeting the expected next-period demand (minimizes expected lost sales without overstocking since holding cost equals lost margin). Using defaults also leverages the confirmed lead-time=0 signal and the full historical sample set to stabilize orders while avoiding overreaction to single-period spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $82.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods (P1\u2013P8). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent actual demands (concluded) by period: P1=98, P2=62, P3=68, P4=96, P5=84, P6=56, P7=85, P8=115. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so critical fractile q = 0.5 (z*\u22480) and the OR base-stock reduces toward the demand forecast (mu_hat). Given the stable confirmed lead time = 0 and no sustained demand regime shift (no 3+ period consistent change warranting a new regime), I use the default forecasting approach so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps the OR engine centered on the full-sample mean demand and lets the backend apply the capped ordering rule; it balances service level and holding cost appropriately when profit = holding. I also note that with L=0 any order placed now will arrive within the same period (per observed confirmations), so ordering to the base-stock will immediately replenish on-hand before demand is realized.

Daily Reward (R_t): $85.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order from Periods 1\u20139 arrived same period (lead_time=0 consistently). Recent demands (Periods 1\u20135 samples provided: 84,55,79,85,126 and additional concluded demands in history through Period 9) show no sustained regime shift requiring special weighting. Promised lead time is 0 and observed lead time has been consistently 0, so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm this. Using default forecasts for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) keeps the OR backend grounded in full-sample statistics; with profit=holding cost, the backend will target a moderate service level via its base-stock formula. This choice balances service (avoid lost sales given zero lead time) against holding cost given no strong evidence of a regime change or upcoming event. If future concluded periods show a sustained mean or volatility shift or delayed arrivals, I'll switch to a recent_N or explicit method.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-7.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 context: historic concluded demands (P1\u2013P10) show variable demand with a recent 5-period average (P6\u2013P10 = 56,85,115,88,39) of 76.6 units. On-hand = 46, in-transit = 0. All concluded arrival messages (through Period 10) confirm lead time = 0 consistently, so I rely on promised lead time. Because profit = holding cost ($1/$1) the service-level quantile is 0.5 (z*=0) so the OR backend will target the demand mean across the review+lead period; using a recent-window demand estimate helps adapt to the modest regime fluctuation around Periods 6\u201310. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (includes a brief spike at P8 but balances with the low P10). With L=default (0), the backend can place same-period orders to refill toward the base stock; this avoids stockouts while limiting inventory since holding cost equals profit. This setup balances service-level needs (use recent demand mean) against holding cost exposure and leverages confirmed zero lead time so orders can immediately correct inventory shortfalls.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 decision. Recent history shows frequent same-period arrivals (Periods 1\u201311 conclude all report arrived=ordered, confirming lead time = 0) and no sustained demand regime shift (demands observed: 98,62,68,96,84,56,85,115,88,39,76). Current inventory: on-hand = 1, in-transit = 0. No shipments are overdue or missing. Given confirmed 0-period lead time and no clear, sustained increase or decrease in demand (fluctuations but no 3+ period consistent shift), I use the defaults so the OR backend can compute the review+lead demand statistics from the full history: L="default" (use promised lead time = 0), mu_hat="default" (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat="default" (backend will compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base-stock from the full-sample mean and variance and the known profit/holding ratio.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 decision with on-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concluded history (Periods 1\u201312) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period). Recent demands have variability but no sustained regime change (spikes are temporary). With profit = holding cost, critical service level q = 0.5 so no aggressive safety stock is warranted. Because actual lead time equals promised 0 and there is no strong changepoint, I use default aggregation across all samples to stabilize forecasts. This ensures the OR backend computes base_stock from the full-sample mean and variance, letting the capped policy limit ordering size while covering (1+L) periods of expected demand. Using defaults also avoids overreacting to short-term demand swings given low on-hand and zero in-transit.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. History shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 repeatedly through Period 13) and no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand history (Periods 1\u201313) is variable but shows a stable average around prior samples; given lead time confirmed as 0 and profit=holding cost, use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base_stock from all historical samples. Using default L keeps promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost automatically under the engine's capped ordering policy. This approach is conservative: it leverages full history for stable estimates and avoids overfitting to short recent fluctuations when on-hand and pipeline are zero.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201314) consistently show arrivals with lead_time=0; earlier carry-over insight confirmed lead time = 0 at Period 5 and subsequent concludes continue to match promised lead time. Demand history (Periods 1\u201314) shows mean \u2248 80.93 units and sample std \u2248 19.77. Given zero pipeline and immediate same-period replenishment (lead time = 0), use the default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This balances service level and holding cost by relying on full-sample statistics with L=promised (0) \u2014 appropriate because arrivals have been reliably same-period and there is no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Ordering will therefore target the base-stock implied by the backend using these defaults.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16. On-hand = 28, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in Period 5 conclude: early periods P1\u2013P5 all arrived same period, and subsequent concluded periods P6\u2013P15 arrivals also show lead_time 0), so promised lead time is reliable. Demand history available to the OR engine (seed samples) should be used without recent-regime adjustments \u2014 no sustained changepoint in demand is evident that would justify switching to a recent or explicit forecast. Given profit = holding cost, the critical service-level tradeoff is balanced; using the backend defaults (L = promised, mu_hat and sigma_hat derived from all samples) lets the OR engine compute the base-stock and capped order consistent with historical variability. This also avoids overreacting to short-term demand fluctuations while current on-hand (28) provides some immediate coverage for period demand.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start. Observed history (Periods 1\u201316) shows actual lead time consistently 0 (arrivals same period as order). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals expected this period other than an order placed now (with lead time 0 it will arrive during this period). Demand history shows moderate variability but no sustained regime shift. I therefore use the default lead time (promised = 0, confirmed by concluded history) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps parameters simple and consistent with confirmed same-period fulfillment, letting the backend set base-stock to balance the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded orders (P1\u2013P17) all show arrived same period as ordered (lead_time=0). Recent demand has been variable (samples in history show demands ranging ~39\u2013133) but no sustained upward/downward regime change detected. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 vs $1) so the backend will target a 50% fractile (z* \u2248 0) \u2014 using default forecasts lets the OR engine set base_stock = (1+L)*mean_demand. Given confirmed same-period deliveries and no evidence of lost/late shipments, I select default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the backend uses all historical samples to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively while the environment remains stable.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and confirmed actual lead time=0 across concluded periods (orders placed P1\u2013P18 all arrived same period). Historical demand samples available (chips(Regular) sample series used by engine: 84, 55, 79, 85, 126) imply moderate mean and variance. With profit = holding = $1, critical fractile q = 0.5, so target service level is 50% and z* = 0; the OR backend will place orders to bring pipeline to the base stock driven by the sample mean scaled by (1+L). Given confirmed lead time 0, no need to inflate L. On-hand + pipeline = 0 so we should let the backend use its default estimates (use all samples) so it computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the policy simple, leverages full sample history, and balances stock vs holding cost appropriately given equal profit and holding costs. No evidence of a new sustained demand regime or delayed shipments since lead time and demand appear stable in concluded history.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201319) consistently show arrivals in the same period they were ordered; prior carry-over confirmed lead time = 0. Demand history shows variability including a one-off large demand in Period 19 (166) but no sustained regime change (no 3+ periods of elevated demand). Given confirmed same-period lead time and no sustained demand shift, use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set. This keeps forecasting anchored to long-run mean/volatility while the backend's capped policy will limit order size versus pipeline. Default choices balance service level vs holding cost appropriately when profit and holding cost are equal (symmetric newsvendor), and avoid overreacting to single-period spikes or presumed missing shipments.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 decision. All concluded history (Periods 1\u201320) shows actual lead time consistently 0 (every concluded arrival was same-period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand plus target safety. Given stable historical samples for chips(Regular) (samples: [84,55,79,85,126,84,54,82,85,85,31,80,77,82,83,53,84,84,85,88]) I use the OR engine defaults so base stock is computed from the full-sample mean and variance with L=promised (0). Using default L and default mu_hat/sigma_hat keeps the backend aligned with observed same-period arrivals and the backend's capped ordering rule. This balances service level (profit=holding cost, so q=0.5) against holding cost while avoiding overreacting to short-term variability. If future conclude messages show persistent lead-time or demand regime shifts, I'll switch to recent_N or explicit methods.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22 update: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (through Period_21) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period), so I trust promised lead time. Demand has shifted up since Period_16: recent periods (P16\u2013P21) show sustained higher demand compared with earlier history, so I use a recent-sample forecast to capture the new regime. Decisions: L set to default (promised 0). mu_hat set with recent_N using the most recent regime (N=6, covering Period_16\u2013P21) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean of those last 6 demands; this raises the base-stock to match the higher realized demand. sigma_hat set with recent_N N=6 to reflect elevated recent volatility rather than diluting with older low-variance data. This combination raises target inventory to avoid missed sales in the new higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent variability; with profit=holding, the backend will pick z\u22480.5 (q=0.5) so we avoid excessive overstock but respond to the persistent demand increase. I flag that on-hand+pipeline=0 so the first order will need to cover current-period demand plus safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased from 79.2 (Periods 1\u201315) to 118.8 (Periods 16\u201321), +62.7%, sustained over 6 periods

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 with on-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders from P1\u2013P22 all arrived same period). A sustained demand regime shift was confirmed at Period 16 (higher mean since P16). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. To capture the higher recent demand regime, I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 16\u201322) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat: N equals the regime length since the confirmed changepoint (7 periods), capped by rules (min/regime_length logic). This focuses the backend forecast on the post-changepoint demand level so base_stock increases to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat from the same recent window captures elevated variability. That balances the profit-driven service level against holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 start: on-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (P1\u2013P23 all arrived same period). Recent demand since Period 16 has been persistently higher (carry-over notes a sustained regime shift starting at Period 16). Current available stock (30) is small relative to recent single-period demand (many recent demands ~90\u2013160). To protect service level under the confirmed L=0 and the higher recent demand regime, I bias the forecast to the most recent regime rather than full-history averages. Therefore: use promised/default lead time (L="default") because concluded history confirms 0; set mu_hat using recent_N on the latest regime to capture the new higher mean demand (N=8 covers Periods 16\u201323, the sustained higher-demand window); set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N to reflect current volatility. This gives the OR backend a demand estimate tuned to the new regime so base-stock will be raised to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat preserves safety-stock for variability. With L=0 this effectively targets one-period demand; given on-hand=30 and typical recent demand ~90\u2013120, the backend will order up toward that higher base-stock while the cap prevents extreme orders, balancing profit (unit margin = holding cost) against holding costs.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0 (confirmed through Period_24). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period_16 (higher mean ~118.8) and persists through recent periods; recent demands remain elevated (Periods 16\u201324). To protect service with zero pipeline and elevated demand, I use the recent-demand regime to set forecast and volatility. L: keep default (promised lead time = 0) because every concluded arrival through Period_24 matched same-period delivery. mu_hat: use recent_N on the most recent regime to capture the higher mean (N=9, Periods 16\u201324). sigma_hat: use recent_N with the same N=9 to reflect recent volatility. This combination directs the OR engine to target base stock appropriate for the new higher-demand regime while not inflating lead-time expectations (no evidence of delays), balancing profit vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201325) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period ordered). Demand experienced a sustained higher regime starting at Period 16 (Periods 16\u201325 show noticeably larger average demand than Periods 1\u201315). Given zero observed pipeline and recent high demand, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concludes confirm same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate focused on the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201325) to avoid dilution from the earlier, lower-demand periods; regime length = 10 so N=10. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 captures recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the higher demand while using recent volatility to avoid over-ordering given holding cost equals profit, balancing service level and inventory cost.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 decision. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed repeatedly) and a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 16 (higher demand since then). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover current-period demand (orders arrive same period). I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean: the regime from Period 16\u201326 has length 11, so I use N=11 to let mu_hat reflect elevated recent demand rather than diluting with earlier low-demand periods. Similarly I set sigma_hat recent_N with N=11 to capture recent variability (spikes to 166\u2013169\u2013168). These choices make the backend compute a base-stock sized to cover the elevated recent mean while using recent variability to set safety stock, balancing higher service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 context: confirmed same-period arrivals historically (lead time 0). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 16 (carry-over noted). Current on-hand=17, in-transit=0 \u2014 low cover versus recent higher demand (we just saw sales of 111 in Period 27). To protect service while balancing $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.5 \u2192 moderate z*), I keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms lead time = 0. For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach (N=12) to capture the post-changepoint higher mean and recent volatility (regime since Period 16 through Period 27 has ~12 periods). Using recent 12 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std focused on the current high-demand regime, reducing stockouts compared with using all-sample averages while not overreacting to single-period spikes. This choice addresses missing/in-transit = 0 by explicitly biasing forecast upward to replenish from a low on-hand position and limits excess safety stock by using recent variability rather than overly large all-sample variance.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 decision. On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (avg increased from ~79 to ~119). No overdue or missing shipments to account for. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history confirms 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=13 (regime from Period 16\u201328 is 13 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 13 samples, capturing the higher post-changepoint mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=13 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices make the OR backend target a base-stock that protects service level under the new, higher-demand regime while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand data.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P29) consistently show actual lead time = 0, so use the default promised lead time. A sustained demand regime shift was confirmed at Period 16 (higher mean demand since P16), so I rely on recent data rather than all-sample averages. I choose recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime: Periods 16\u201329 (regime length = 14), so N=14. This focuses the OR backend on the elevated, sustained demand while keeping the lead-time short (L=default) so orders arrive same period. With profit=holding, the backend will set a critical fractile of 0.5; using recent demand mean and variance will raise the base-stock to match the higher demand while avoiding excess inventory buildup by not using the full longer-history mean.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 0 in multiple periods (P1\u2192P1 ... P30\u2192P30). Demand regime increased starting Period 16 and has persisted through Period 30; recent periods show substantially higher demand than the early-sample mean. With profit = holding, target service quantile is 0.5 (balanced), so we should set demand forecasts using the post-changepoint samples only to avoid understock. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime. I choose N=16 (Periods 16\u201331 window length) because the regime has been sustained and N is within allowed bounds; this focuses the base-stock on the higher recent mean and volatility, improving fill rates while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 context: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment (lead time observed = 0 for every concluded order through Period 31). Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 16 (periods 16\u201331 show elevated demand vs. periods 1\u201315). To keep the OR backend aligned with the confirmed fast lead time and the sustained higher-demand regime, I choose L=default (use promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=16 (covering Periods 16\u201331) so mu_hat reflects the elevated regime average across the review+lead window. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=16 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices ensure the base_stock reflects the higher mean demand observed since Period 16 while keeping lead-time assumptions consistent with confirmed arrivals, balancing service level (avoid stockouts in the new regime) against holding costs.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 start. On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment (lead_time observed = 0 across many concluded periods), and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 16 (noted in provided carry-over). Recent realized demand since Period 16 is materially higher than Periods 1\u201315. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; no evidence of lost or delayed shipments. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N covering the post-changepoint regime: the regime from Period 16 through Period 32 is 17 periods long, so I set N=17 (N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)). This focuses the OR backend forecast on the elevated demand regime and tightens safety stock to the current variance. These choices help the OR engine target a higher base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while avoiding overstating demand by using older low-demand periods. With holding cost = profit, the backend will choose z such that profit/(profit+holding)=0.5, balancing service level and inventory cost. Using recent post-changepoint data reduces stockouts from underforecasting while not unduly increasing holding cost from including long-ago low demand.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34. On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment (lead time = 0) and a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period_16 (higher mean sustained for many periods). Given the sustained higher-demand regime since Period_16, I bias the forecast to recent observations rather than long-run pre-shift data. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0 lead time. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N to capture the post-shift regime using the most recent continuous regime length (Periods 16\u201333 => 18 periods) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 18 demands. For uncertainty (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N with N=18 so variability reflects the current regime. These choices raise the base-stock to protect availability under the higher demand while letting the capped ordering rule and holding cost limit excessive inventory buildup.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35. On-hand=29, in-transit=0.

Demand experienced a sustained upward shift starting at Period 16 (previous carry-over noted) \u2014 recent periods remain at that higher regime. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I base demand forecast on the most recent data in the elevated regime. I choose recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses the last 10 demand samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant recent regime; this tightens the forecast to current demand and reduces overstating safety stock from older low-demand history. With profit=holding, the backend will set z* = \u03a6\u22121(0.5)=0, so centering mu_hat on recent mean balances fill vs hold. Using recent_N for sigma helps the cap reflect current volatility rather than older periods.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history (P1\u2013P35 arrivals all same-period). Demand regime increased around Period 16 (previously recorded): recent periods (P16\u2013P35) show substantially higher and sustained demand (~100\u2013160) versus earlier. To keep service while minimizing stockouts with lead time 0, I use the recent high-demand regime for the forecast. Therefore: L = default (promised 0). mu_hat: use recent_N to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent regime (I choose N=20 covering Periods 16\u201335 where the higher demand is sustained). sigma_hat: use recent_N with the same N=20 so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward stocking for the higher post-changepoint demand, improving fill rates while not overstating uncertainty beyond the recent regime.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 context: confirmed fast supply (actual lead time = 0 historically) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16. Current inventory: on-hand=4, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Recent demand has been consistently above the early-period mean (regime from P16 onward); to reflect the sustained higher mean and recent variability I use a recent-window estimate. L set to default (promised 0) because conclude messages through Period 36 consistently show 0-period arrivals. For demand I select recent_N with N=20 (using the most recent 20 demand observations within the confirmed high-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility; choosing 20 balances responsiveness to recent behavior while smoothing noise (N = min(regime_length,20) where regime_length \u2248 21 since P16). This raises the base-stock to reduce stockouts under the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat based on the same recent window informs safety stock; with profit=holding, target service quantile is moderate so the backend will cap orders to avoid excessive overstock. Given on-hand=4 and no in-transit, the backend will compute the order to bring pipeline up to the base-stock derived from these recent estimates.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. On-hand=16, In-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (through Period 37) confirm actual lead time = 0 (arrivals occurred same period). Demand regime shifted up around Period 16 and has persisted; to reflect the higher, sustained demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent stable regime. I choose N=20 (max sensible cap) to capture the recent elevated demand pattern (Periods ~18\u201337) while smoothing short-term noise. Using L=default (promised lead time = 0) keeps pipeline horizon minimal and matches observed arrivals. Recent_N for mu_hat raises the base stock to cover (1+L)-period demand at the higher regime; recent_N for sigma_hat captures current volatility so the backend's capped ordering policy balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5, z*=0). With on-hand=16 and no in-transit, this policy will prompt orders to bring pipeline up to the higher regime-driven base stock while avoiding excessive overstock.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. On-hand = 3, in-transit = 0. Promised lead time = 0 and historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period) so I trust the promised lead time. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 16 (carry-over insight): recent average demand is materially higher than pre-Period16. To protect service level while avoiding excess holding (profit = holding cost), I target the post-change regime when forecasting. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N over the most recent sustained high-demand regime to capture the new mean; per the changepoint at Period 16 the current regime length is >20, so I choose N=20 (caps/regime rules). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend compute a base-stock sized to meet the higher, sustained demand while using recent volatility to set safety stock \u2014 balancing service against holding cost given profit = holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (many confirms P1\u2192P39 arrivals same period). Demand regime shifted up around Period 16 and has since stabilized at the higher level (already recorded in carry-over). Current on-hand = 41, in-transit = 0, so no overdue shipments. Profit and holding cost are both $1/unit so critical fractile q = 0.5 (OR backend will target median). Given confirmed same-period deliveries and a stable elevated demand regime, I use the promised lead time (default) and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all available demand samples so it incorporates the full history including the post-Period-16 higher mean. This balances service (avoid stockouts with same-day replenishment) against holding cost; leaving parameter estimation to the backend avoids overfitting to short-term swings when lead time is reliably 0. No new sustained changepoint detected this period.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41. History shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period_16 (previously recorded). Current on-hand=7, in-transit=0 so available inventory is very low relative to the elevated demand seen since Period_16. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 and prior concludes confirm actual lead time = 0, so use default lead time. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use a recent-window demand estimate: recent_N with N=20 (captures Periods 21\u201340 mostly within the high regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock appropriate to the new normal while keeping volatility estimated from the same recent window. These parameters aim to raise target inventory to avoid stockouts (protect profit) while sigma_hat from the same recent window prevents overstocking by reflecting recent variability.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 context: on-hand=30, in-transit=0, confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (consistent across many concluded periods). Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 16 (higher mean). To keep the OR backend targeting the current higher-demand regime I set L to the default promised lead time (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 (the most recent 20 demand observations) so mu_hat reflects the elevated, sustained demand since Period 16 while limiting noise from older low-demand samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 so safety stock reflects recent volatility. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so the backend will target roughly a 50% critical fractile; using recent data helps avoid stockouts given current realized demand. With on-hand=30 and no in-transit, these parameters push orders to restore stock to the updated base-stock level tuned to recent demand and variability while avoiding oversized inventory from older low-demand periods.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed across many concluded periods) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 (carry-over insight from Period 22). On-hand = 45, in-transit = 0, so there are no pending arrivals to cover current period demand. Given profit = holding cost, the OR backend's critical fractile q = 0.5, so a symmetric service/holding balance is appropriate. I therefore use the default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) plus standard deviation adjustments internally. Using defaults keeps the policy aligned with historically confirmed lead time=0 and the long-run sample statistics that already incorporate the post-Period-16 higher-demand regime, while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise. This should produce orders that replenish to the backend-calculated base stock while capping by the OR cap to limit large single-period receipts and holding costs.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44 context: on-hand=10, in-transit=0, promised L=0 and historical concludes consistently show lead time = 0 (P1\u2013P43 arrivals), so use default lead time. Demand context: there was a sustained regime shift starting at Period_16 (noted in carry-over): average demand increased materially and has persisted through current period. To keep safety stock responsive to the higher post-changepoint regime, I use a recent_N estimate for demand mean and volatility based on the most recent regime. Regime length since Period_16 through Period_43 is ~28 periods; per rules I cap N at 20. So I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 (this focuses the base-stock and safety buffer on the higher-demand regime). This balances service level (capture higher recent mean and variance) against holding cost by restricting the window to recent high-demand data rather than diluting with older low-demand samples. No overdue shipments or lost arrivals are apparent (arrivals have consistently concluded same period), so L remains default.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed across many periods) and a sustained demand regime shift noted at Period 16 (higher mean since then). No overdue or missing shipments to account for. To keep the OR backend aligned with the sustained higher-demand regime and capture recent volatility, I set lead time to the promised/default (0) and estimate demand using a recent window so the base-stock reflects the post-shift demand pattern. I choose recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the most recent 20 periods (captures the higher-demand regime and current variability) while smoothing shorter swings. This will raise the base-stock relative to long-run average to reduce stockouts under the higher demand, and sigma_hat from recent data will size safety stock appropriately vs. holding cost (profit and holding cost equal, so service-level target is moderate).

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. Recent history shows actual lead time reliably 0 (every concluded period P1\u2013P45 arrivals matched same-period orders). Demand samples (Periods 1\u201325 listed in environment) show a sustained higher regime from Period 16 onward (noted previously). Current on-hand = 34, in-transit = 0; with promised lead time 0 we will receive any order placed this period within the same period (and see confirmation in the period conclude). Given stable confirmed lead time=0 and a previously recorded demand regime shift, I choose conservative, standard estimates so the OR backend (which expects promised lead time) can compute its base-stock without additional manual overrides: use default lead time (promised), default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This lets the OR engine combine the long-run sample statistics with the profit/holding tradeoff to set service level (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5). With on-hand=34 and no in-transit, the engine will order up to the computed base-stock, balancing fill rate vs holding cost. If we observe any future missed or delayed arrivals, I will switch to an explicit or recent_N lead-time estimate and adjust mu_hat to recent demand samples.

Given zero pipeline and immediate same-period replenishment historically, I choose to use the default lead time (promised LT=0) so the OR engine treats demand as same-period. For demand parameters I select default formulas so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which uses the full historical sample set (capturing both pre- and post-shift data). This is conservative: it leverages all data while the backend's base-stock formula (with q = profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 \u2192 z*=0) will target mean demand, balancing service level and holding costs. With on-hand and in-transit both zero, the OR engine will order toward the computed base stock immediately to meet Period 47 demand within the same period.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed across many periods) and a sustained demand regime increase that began at Period 16 (higher averages since then). Given current on-hand is low and no pipeline, we must replenish to cover this period's demand plus expected near-term demand. I will trust the promised lead time and use L='default' (0). For demand forecast I bias toward recent data to reflect the sustained higher regime and any recent volatility: use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 20 demand samples. This focuses the base-stock on the higher post-shift demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using observed variability. This approach balances service (avoid stockouts given on-hand=15 and zero in-transit) against holding cost by relying on recent realized demand and the backend's capped ordering cap.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show promised lead time has been reliably 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P48 arrivals same period). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 16 (documented earlier). Recent realized demand (Periods 29\u201348 and surrounding) centers around ~100\u2013120 units with notable variability. Given zero observed pipeline and same-period replenishment reliability, I use the promised lead time (default L=0). For demand I choose a recent_N estimate to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint higher-demand regime; I select N=20 (the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 samples) to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing short-term noise. For volatility I also choose recent_N N=20 so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the same recent window, ensuring safety stock reflects recent variability. This balances service (higher mean after the regime shift) against holding cost (profit and holding cost are equal so target service quantile is moderate). No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Daily Reward (R_t): $90.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50. On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201349) consistently show orders arriving the same period they were placed; prior carry-over confirmed lead time = 0. No new sustained demand regime change visible in recent periods (demand varies but no 3+ period persistent shift beyond previously recorded Period 16 shift). Given profit = holding ($1/$1) the OR base-stock will target mean demand; I select default lead time to keep the model aligned with the supplier's promised 0-period lead time and use default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and default sigma. This is conservative and avoids overreacting to short fluctuations when on-hand is low (5) and no in-transit cover exists. Default choices keep ordering responsive (same-period arrivals) while the backend's cap will limit order size relative to estimated mean demand and variability.
