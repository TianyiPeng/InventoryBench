Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular): [95, 113, 106, 84, 71] with mean \u2248 93.8 units/period and notable but not extreme variance. Promised lead time is 0 and there are no concluded arrivals yet (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). No evidence of a sustained demand regime change or lead-time shift (only the initial 5-sample history). To let the OR backend compute the base-stock using its full-sample estimates and the promised lead time, I select default methods so the engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service level (high profit per unit) with holding cost by relying on the full-sample mean/variance until a clear changepoint or late/missing shipments are observed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $998.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. Observed context: Period_1 conclude shows an on-hand of 66 after Period_1 sales=56 and an order placed in Period_1 arrived same period (ordered lead_time observed = 0). Current on-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical demand dataset for chips(Regular) (used for forecasting) has mean = 93.8 units/period (samples: 95,113,106,84,71) and sample std \u2248 16.85. A single low observed sale (56 in Period_1) is notable but not yet a sustained regime change (only one period), so I will be conservative and keep the baseline demand estimate. Lead time: promised = 0 and confirmed by the Period_1 conclude (order placed Period_1 arrived Period_1), so use the default (promised) lead time. Therefore I choose default statistical methods: mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from all samples so the OR engine will set base-stock using the historic mean (\u224893.8) and volatility (\u224816.85). This balances service level (using multi-period demand average) against holding cost; given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), keeping the baseline higher mean protects against stockouts while the OR backend caps orders via its cap parameter. No evidence of lost shipments or sustained lead-time/demand shift yet, so no explicit adjustments.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. On-hand = 25, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded lead times: Period1 order arrived with lead_time=0, Period2 order arrived with lead_time=0 \u2014 average observed lead time = 0. Use 'calculate' for L to reflect observed lead-time history. Demand history (provided samples: 95,113,106,84,71) has no clear sustained changepoint (only 5 samples, no 3+ period regime shift), so use defaults for demand estimates: mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). With L=0 this yields mu_hat \u2248 mean(samples) and sigma_hat \u2248 std(samples). These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock anchored to the long-run sample mean/volatility while the confirmed short lead time lets the policy respond quickly to on-hand inventory (current on-hand 25, no pipeline). This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Profit: $2337.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2337.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision: promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals in Periods 1-3 all show lead_time=0, so no evidence of longer actual lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand (L+1 = 1 periods). Recent realized demand (from conclude messages) has trended up over the last three observed periods: 56, 98, 137 (mean = 97). To be responsive to the evident upward regime while avoiding overstock, I use L=default (promised 0). For demand level I use a recent_N estimate with N=3 to focus the forecast on the clear recent increase; mu_hat will therefore be (1+L)*mean(last 3 observed demands) = 1*97. For uncertainty I also use recent_N with N=3 so the OR engine sizes safety stock to recent variability. These choices ensure the OR backend targets service for the currently elevated demand while keeping holding-cost sensitivity (profit/holding implies high service quantile) appropriate given rapid demand change. No overdue shipments are visible in concluded history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected over Periods 1-3: recent observed avg = 97 (56,98,137) vs historical sample mean \u2248 93.8 (+~3.4%); treat recent 3-period regime as current baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1476.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 context: on-hand=82, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples show a recent higher-demand regime in the last 3 concluded periods (Period 1-3 demands: 56, 98, 137; recent mean \u2248 97) which was already recorded as a carry-over insight. All observed lead times in concluded history are 0 periods. Given the short promised lead time and the clear recent regime, I use the promised lead time (default L=0) and baseline demand computed from the most recent 3-period regime to keep the OR backend responsive to the elevated recent mean. I select recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat so the backend sets base_stock around the recent mean demand (1+L times recent mean) and select recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders tuned to the current demand regime while the low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19) justify maintaining service levels rather than aggressively cutting stock. With on-hand=82 and no in-transit, the backend will order up to the base-stock recommended for the recent regime, balancing service level (high profit-driven q) and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2067.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: recent observed demands (Periods 3-5) = [137, 82, 111], on-hand=42, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time = 0 consistently (orders placed arrived same period), so promised lead time (0) remains appropriate. Demand appears to have shifted upward recently \u2014 the last 3-period mean = 110 units (vs longer-run mean ~96), so I use a recent-3 demand baseline to capture the new regime. Setting L="default" keeps lead time = promised 0 (supported by repeated observed 0 lead_time). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=3) so the OR backend targets (1+L)*mean_recent = 1*110 \u2248 110 units of pipeline+on-hand. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect the higher short-term volatility (std of [137,82,111] \u2248 ~27.5). This combination raises the base-stock to improve service (capture the recent higher demand) while keeping lead time conservative; it balances the high unit profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by prioritizing service level increases driven by recent regime evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2964.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 decision. Recent demand has increased vs historical baseline: last three realized demands (Periods 4-6) = 82, 111, 167 \u2192 recent average = 120 units/period, compared with historical sample mean \u2248 93.8. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, and all concluded arrivals (Periods 1-6) show observed lead_time = 0 consistently, so no overdue or lost shipments to cover. I set lead time to be estimated from observed history to confirm actual 0. For demand I treat the most recent 3-period regime (Periods 4-6) as the current baseline because it is a sustained 3-period shift upward; therefore I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to size the (1+L)-period forecast to this higher regime. I also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects the increased recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given the spike to 167) while keeping holding cost modest because L=0 keeps the review horizon short.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 4-6: avg increased from 93.8 to 120 (+27.9%), treat recent 3-period regime as current baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2508.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 decision. Recent demand has accelerated: last 3 observed demands (Periods 5-7) = 111, 167, 135 (avg = 137.67), up from the prior detected regime avg of 120. On-hand = 57, in-transit = 0, promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically. Because demand has shifted upward for three consecutive periods, I treat the most recent 3-period regime as the current baseline. Therefore: set L using calculate (confirming actual lead time from concluded history); set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to target (1+L)*mean of the most recent 3 demands (so the OR backend increases base-stock to cover higher demand this review+lead window); set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher volatility observed in the same recent window. This balances higher service-level (avoiding stockouts given the surge) against holding cost by limiting the lookback to the newest regime (N=3) rather than the full historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 5-7: avg = 137.67 (Periods 5-7 demands 111,167,135) vs prior regime avg 120 (+14.7%); treat recent 3-period regime as current baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2376.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: recent demand has been elevated compared with the early-sample baseline. History shows concluded demands for Periods 6-8 = {167,135,128} and ending on-hand = 56, in-transit = 0; there are no overdue or in-transit shipments to expect. Promised lead time is 0 and all observed lead times in history are 0, so I keep L at the default (same-period arrival). For demand I target the most recent short-term regime: use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 6-8) because the last 3 periods show a consistently higher mean (~143.3) than earlier samples; this better captures elevated demand going into the current decision (avoids stockouts). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the immediate volatility in the high-demand regime. Given high profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1), this choice raises the base-stock to favor service level while using the capped order logic to limit excessive overstock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1942.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 start. On-hand=72, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order (Periods 1\u20139) arrived with lead_time=0 (each conclude message: lead_time was 0), so actual lead time is confidently 0; no overdue or lost shipments observed. Recent demand (Periods 7\u20139 = 135, 128, 106) shows a higher baseline than the original early-sample mean; recent 3-period average = 123 units. I therefore choose L by calculating the average observed lead time (captures confirmed 0 lead time). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to make mu_hat reflect the latest regime (N=3 chosen because the most recent changepoint evidence and prior carry-over notes indicate 3-period regime shifts). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices give the OR backend a forecast covering (1+L) periods using the most recent regime, keeping service high given profit=$19 vs holding=$1 while avoiding excessive inventory from older, lower-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2132.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 decision. Recent realized lead times (Periods 1-10) have all concluded as 0 periods, so promised lead time = 0 is still supported. Recent demand shows a higher recent baseline than the long-run sample mean: the most recent 3 demands (Periods 8-10 = 128, 106, 114) average 116 units. On-hand = 34, in-transit = 0, so current pipeline + on-hand (34) is well below one-period demand at the recent regime (~116). To keep service while limiting holding cost, I use a recent-3 demand estimate so the OR backend targets inventory for the current short-term regime (captures the verified step-up in demand around Periods 5-8). I therefore set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast I select recent_N with N=3 to make mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 periods (captures current regime avg \u2248116). For volatility I also select recent_N N=3 so the backend computes sigma_hat from the same 3-period window (reflecting current short-run variability). These choices prioritize meeting the elevated short-run demand signal while avoiding carrying excessive inventory based on older, lower-demand periods.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 context: recent observed demands (Periods 9-11) = [106,114,108], recent mean \u2248 109.3. All concluded arrivals through Period 11 show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), and there are no outstanding in-transit units (on-hand=27, in-transit=0). No overdue or lost shipments detected. Given stable same-period arrivals historically and the most recent demand regime (Periods 9-11) representing the current baseline, I set lead time to default (promised 0). To align the OR backend with the short-run demand level and limit excess holding given low holding cost ($1) vs high profit ($19), I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 (Periods 9-11) so the base-stock reflects the immediate recent mean and volatility. This keeps service high for the current demand regime while avoiding unnecessary inventory accumulation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2223.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, historically all observed arrivals (Periods 1\u201312 conclude) show actual lead time = 0. Recent demand (Periods 10\u201312) = [114, 108, 121], recent 3-period avg \u2248 114.33. With profit=$19/unit and holding=$1/unit, we should keep target inventory tight to avoid holding cost while preserving service level. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the empirically observed average lead time (0) rather than the promised default; this is supported by consistent concluded lead_time=0 across many periods. For demand, I select recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the base-stock on the most recent regime (Periods 10\u201312) because demand has shifted down from the earlier high (Periods 5\u20138) and the last 3 periods provide a concise, recent baseline. Using recent_N keeps the (1+L)\xd7mean focused on the current demand level, reducing excess inventory given low holding cost sensitivity relative to profit. The chosen parameters help the OR backend set a base-stock that balances high profit per unit (favoring service) against minimizing holding costs by relying on the recent lower-demand regime. No overdue shipments are visible; pipeline inventory=0, so orders placed this period must cover current-period demand as well.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected starting Period 9\u201312: avg = 112.25 (Periods 9\u201312 demands 106,114,108,121) vs prior regime avg 137.67 (Periods 5\u20137) \u2192 decline \u2248 -18.6%; treat recent down-shift as current baseline.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 context: recent concluded periods show all orders arriving with lead_time=0 historically. Latest demand samples (Periods 9\u201312 = 106,114,108,121) indicate a lower demand regime vs earlier peaks; recent 4-period average = 112.25. Current inventory: on-hand=58, in-transit=0, so no arrivals will be visible until future concludes. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals confirm actual lead_time=0 across history, so I use the default (promised) lead time. For demand forecast I target the most recent sustained regime (Periods 9\u201312) by using recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat so the backend sets base_stock around (1+L)*mean_recent and responds to the recent downshift. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=4 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These choices keep reorder targets aligned with the recently observed lower demand, avoid overstock (holding cost $1/unit) while preserving service given profit=$19/unit. Given on-hand=58 and no pipeline, the backend will compute orders from these inputs to balance service level vs holding costs.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 context: promised lead time = 0; all concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201314) show lead_time = 0 (no evidence of delayed or lost shipments). On-hand = 36, in-transit = 0. Recent demand history (Periods 1\u201314) shows variable demand but no new sustained regime shift (single low demand in Period 13 not yet sustained). Given stable confirmed lead time and no new sustained demand regime, use default estimators so the OR backend applies the full-sample mean/variance over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (using overall historical mean \u2248 109.79 units) against holding cost; keeping L as default (0) avoids inflating pipeline when shipments have been reliably same-period. If a sustained downshift emerges in future periods (3+ periods), switch to a recent_N or explicit forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1470.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 start. On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201315) show actual lead_time=0 consistently, so no lead-time surprise or lost shipments to account for. Recent demand shows a clear down-shift over the last 3 periods (Periods 13\u201315 demands = 68, 106, 81; mean \u2248 85) compared with the prior baseline (Periods 9\u201312 mean = 112.25). This 3-period drop is sustained (3 consecutive periods) and materially lowers the recent demand level, so I treat the most recent 3-period regime as the current baseline. Therefore: L use default (promised 0). mu_hat set using recent_N with N=3 so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples (captures the new lower baseline). sigma_hat set using recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility around the new baseline. These choices steer the OR engine to lower base-stock and orders to avoid excess holding cost given the observed sustained demand decline, while preserving reasonable service given recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 13\u201315: recent avg = 85.0 (Periods 13\u201315 demands 68,106,81) vs prior regime avg 112.25 (Periods 9\u201312) \u2192 decline \u2248 -24%; treat recent 3-period regime as current baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $643.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (every concluded arrival lists lead_time=0), so I use the default promised lead time. Recent demand has shifted down: the carry-over record flagged a down-shift starting Periods 13\u201315 (avg=85). Including the most recent realized demand in Period 16 (demand=38) suggests the current low-demand regime extends through Period 16. To make the OR engine responsive to this lower recent mean and reduced variability, I use recent_N=4 (Periods 13\u201316 demands: 68,106,81,38) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled forecast and volatility reflect the current regime. On-hand =79 and in-transit=0; with L=0 the OR engine will compare base_stock to on-hand immediately when computing order. Using recent_N reduces the target base stock and caps overstock risk while preserving service by reflecting the new lower demand mean and lower volatility. Holding cost is low relative to profit (q high), so the backend's z* will still push for good availability, but grounding \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 in the recent 4-period regime prevents excessive inventory build-up after the observed demand decline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1120.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. Recent realized lead times (from conclude messages) have consistently been 0 periods (all historical arrivals show lead_time=0), so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Recent demand has clearly shifted down: the last 3 demands (Periods 15-17 = 81, 38, 62) average ~60.33, materially below the prior confirmed regime (avg 85 over Periods 13-15). On-hand inventory = 58 and in-transit = 0 \u2014 this on-hand roughly equals one period of expected demand under the new low regime, so we should replenish to cover (1+L) periods of demand using a recent-window forecast to react to the downshift while keeping holding costs low. Therefore: set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use mu_hat based on recent_N with N=3 to reflect the newest regime mean (so base_stock = (1+L)*recent_mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the current lower volatility. These choices prioritize matching safety stock to the new lower-demand regime (reducing excess holding cost) while ensuring enough stock to meet immediate demand given no in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Periods 15\u201317: recent avg = 60.33 (Periods 15\u201317 demands 81,38,62) vs prior regime avg 85 (Periods 13\u201315) \u2192 decline \u2248 -29%; treat recent 3-period regime as current baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $624.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 context: on-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all past orders arrived same-period), so promised lead time appears accurate. Recent demand has fallen: last three demands (Periods 16-18) = 38, 62, 36, avg = 45.33. This is a meaningful downward shift versus the prior recorded regime (Period 15\u201317 avg ~60.33). Given the clear 3-period low-demand run, I adopt a short recent-window forecast so the OR backend won't overstock (holding cost is low $1/unit but profit is high $19/unit, so we still need some buffer). Decisions: L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new low-demand regime and avoid carrying excess inventory; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect reduced recent volatility. No overdue or lost shipments to reconcile. These parameters reduce target base-stock and cap potential over-ordering while preserving service given high profit per unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 16\u201318: avg demand = 45.33 (Periods 16\u201318 demands 38,62,36) vs prior recent regime avg 60.33 (Periods 15\u201317) \u2192 decline \u2248 -24.8%; treat Periods 16\u201318 as the new baseline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 context: all concluded history (Periods 1\u201319) shows actual lead time = 0 consistently (every concluded arrival states lead_time 0). On-hand = 45, in-transit = 0. Recent demand has trended down; most recent observed demands (Periods 17\u201319) = 62, 36, 25 \u2192 recent mean \u2248 41 units. Given the clear recent downshift and short horizon (promised L=0 consistently confirmed), I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent regime (Periods 17\u201319) so the base-stock reflects the lower recent demand ((1+L)*mean of last 3). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 to capture recent lower volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering risk given low holding cost vs profit (profit >> holding), while keeping service capability for current low-demand regime. The OR backend will compute base_stock from these inputs; using recent 3-period stats aligns ordering to the new lower-demand regime and prevents unnecessary holding costs while maintaining high profit per unit sold.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 context: recent realized demand has declined from earlier regimes; last 3 observed demands (Periods 18-20) = {36, 25, 58} \u2192 recent 3-period average \u2248 39.67 units. On-hand = 15, in-transit = 0, no overdue shipments visible. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so I keep L as default (promised). To avoid excess holding cost given low recent demand while maintaining service, I forecast demand using the most recent short regime: set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the latest low-average regime (captures current drop and recent variability). For consistency, set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) so the OR engine's safety stock reflects recent volatility rather than longer-horizon higher-variance periods. This combination biases orders down relative to historical highs, preserving profit per sale while limiting holding cost given on-hand=15 and no in-transit units. If demand re-accelerates, future conclude messages will trigger a regime update and we will switch forecasting windows accordingly.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: on-hand=9, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201321) show actual lead_time=0 consistently, so I keep L at default (promised). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime: the most recent three observed demands (Periods 19\u201321 = 25, 58, 59) average \u2248 47.33, consistent with prior short-run declines noted in carry-over history. With little stock on hand and no pipeline, we need an order that reflects the current low-demand regime to avoid excess holding cost. Therefore: L=default so backend uses promised lead time; mu_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to target (1+L)*mean of the last 3 periods (captures the current low-demand baseline); sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to reflect the recent volatility. This balances service (prevent stockouts from very low on-hand) against holding cost by reducing forecasted mean and variability to the most recent regime.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 context: on-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=0 (all past concluded orders arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 20\u201322) = [58,59,57], average 58, which is materially higher than the prior short-run baseline (Periods 16\u201318 avg \u224845.33). Pipeline is empty so available inventory only 23 units; given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) we should prioritize service (higher q) and therefore base forecasts on the most recent 3-period regime. I therefore set L to the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms lead_time=0. For demand I select a recent_N (N=3) estimate for mu_hat to capture the latest regime (Periods 20\u201322 avg \u224858) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean_recent. For sigma_hat I also choose recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability; this tightens safety stock to the current lower-volatility regime. These choices address missing pipeline (none) by reacting to the most recent realized demand pattern and bias toward higher service given the high per-unit profit relative to holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 20\u201322: avg demand = 58.0 (Periods 20\u201322 demands 58,59,57) vs prior recent baseline avg 45.33 (Periods 16\u201318) \u2192 increase \u2248 +28%; treat Periods 20\u201322 as new short-run baseline.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals so far show actual lead time = 0 (every past concluded order arrived same period it was ordered). Recent demand has been noisy with several short-lived regime shifts recorded in carry-over; the most recent sustained regime (Periods 20\u201322) increased to ~58, but Period 23 jumped to 72 (single period) \u2014 not a 3+ period sustained shift. No shipments are overdue or lost. Given the lack of a new sustained demand regime and the consistent historical lead time=0, I use the default (promised) lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std. This balances service level (using overall historical mean ~88 units) against holding cost (low $1/unit) and avoids overreacting to a one-period spike. Calculations: mean demand over Periods 1\u201323 \u2248 88.04 units, sample std \u2248 36.24 units; with L=0 the backend will set base-stock = mean + z*\xb7std and cap accordingly.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 context: on-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all arrived same period), so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Recent demand regime: carry-over notes a shift at Periods 20\u201322 (avg \u224858) and subsequent higher demands in Periods 23\u201324 (72,93). The most relevant recent sample window is the last 3 observed demands (Periods 22\u201324 = 57,72,93) with mean \u224874; this short-run mean better captures the recent uptick versus the long-run historical mean. I therefore set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to make the base-stock responsive to recent upward movement: backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3) \u2248 1*74. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 so safety stock reflects recent volatility (std of 57,72,93). This choice balances service level (profit $19 >> holding $1, so target fill rate is high) against holding cost by reacting to the recent increase while not overreacting to a single-period spike. On-hand + pipeline (53) covers roughly 0.7 periods of recent demand (~74), so the OR base-stock will likely order to rebuild to the recent short-run target.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26. Latest visible state: on-hand=77, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals historically show actual lead time = 0, matching the promised lead time, so use default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with supplier behavior. Recent demand is volatile: Periods 23-25 demands = [72, 93, 27], 3-period average = 64 units. Given the clear short-run swings and recent downturn in Period 25, I choose a short-window recent_N forecast to make the base-stock responsive to the latest regime. Therefore: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to let backend compute (1+L)*mean over the most recent 3 periods; sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. This keeps target inventory tight (reducing holding cost) while reacting quickly if the low demand in Period 25 persists or rebounds. On-hand + pipeline (77) already covers roughly one short period of demand at the recent mean (~64), so the recent_N approach avoids over-ordering given holding cost is low but nonzero.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 decision. Current on-hand = 85, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order had lead_time = 0 (all concluded messages report lead_time 0), so I will use the default (promised) lead time. Recent demand has been volatile with multiple short-run regime shifts recorded in carry-over history; the most recent three observed demands (Periods 24\u201326: 93, 27, 35) average \u2248 51.67, which is meaningfully below earlier regimes and represents the latest short-run baseline. To keep the OR engine responsive to the current low short-run demand while still reflecting the 1-period review (L+1), I choose a recent_N = 3 forecast for mu_hat. Similarly, demand variability appears to have changed recently, so I select recent_N = 3 for sigma_hat to capture the short-run volatility estimate. These choices bias orders downward relative to long-run averages (reducing holding cost) while preserving service for the most recent demand regime. No overdue shipments or in-transit inventory to reconcile.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Promised lead time = 0 and every concluded order (Periods 1\u201327) arrived with lead_time=0, so no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Recent demand has softened from earlier spikes: last 3 realized demands (Periods 25\u201327) = {27, 35, 63} with mean \u2248 41.67. This short-run average is materially below some earlier regimes and best represents the immediate demand level we should protect for the current review+lead period. To keep service while limiting holding cost (holding=$1 << profit=$19), I set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use a recent_N (N=3) estimate so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 3 periods (captures the most recent regime). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect short-run volatility from those three observations. These choices bias orders toward the recent lower demand while allowing the OR backend to compute safety stock from recent volatility; that balances very high profit-per-unit against low holding cost while avoiding overstock after recent declines.

Daily Reward (R_t): $747.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 decision. Recent history shows all observed lead times = 0 (orders placed previously all arrived same period). On-hand = 32, in-transit = 0. Profit per unit = $19, holding = $1. Given recent downward movement in demand since Period 23 and particularly the last 3 observed demands (Periods 26\u201328 = 35, 63, 41) which suggest a lower short-run mean, I adopt the promised lead time (default L=0) so OR uses current promised lead time. For demand forecast I use a recent_N=3 estimate for mu_hat to capture the current short-run regime (puts weight on the most recent 3 realized demands). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N=3 to reflect volatility observed in the same short-run window. This keeps target base-stock and safety stock responsive to the verified short-run regime drop, reducing overstock/holding cost while preserving service. Using 3 periods follows the changepoint logic (detecting a recent regime in the last 3 samples) and is conservative given we have only a few very recent samples and no evidence of shifted lead time or lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 26\u201328: avg demand = 46.33 (Periods 26\u201328 demands 35,63,41) vs prior short-run baseline 58 (Periods 20\u201322) \u2192 decline \u2248 -20.1%; treat Periods 26\u201328 as new short-run baseline.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 context: on-hand=4, in-transit=0, product chips(Regular). Promised lead time has been 0 and historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201329) consistently show actual lead_time=0, so I keep L at the promised/default. Recent demand evidence: the most recent 3 realized demands (Periods 27\u201329 = 63, 41, 67) average 57.0, which is above the prior short-run baseline (Periods 26\u201328 avg 46.33) and suggests the short-run demand regime has lifted. Given the small sample and short-run nature, I use a recent_N estimate for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect the latest regime while keeping responsiveness high. This sets the OR backend to plan for (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand and to scale safety stock based on the recent volatility; that increases service level to avoid stockouts given only 4 on-hand and no in-transit, while limiting extra holding cost by using a tight (very recent) sample rather than the long-run mean.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. History shows all observed lead times = 0, on-hand=20, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 28\u201330 = 41,67,61) averages 56.33; this looks like the current short-run baseline after the recent fluctuations recorded in carry-over. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by concludes, so set L = default. To make the OR engine responsive to the very recent regime, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples (\u224856.33). For volatility use recent_N (N=3) as well so sigma_hat reflects variability in these last three observations. This choice keeps target base-stock aligned with current lower-demand regime while allowing the capped order cap to limit outsized replenishment; with profit >> holding cost (q high), the backend will favor service but recent_N keeps inventory from ballooning given on-hand=20 and no in-transit units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1061.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32. Recent realized lead times (from conclude messages) are consistently 0 periods, so use promised/default lead time. On-hand=22, in-transit=0 \u2192 no arrivals expected this period; inventory is low relative to recent demand, so we should target a short-run forecast based on the most recent regime. Demand last 3 periods (P29\u2013P31 = 67,61,57) average \u2248 61.67, which is materially above the prior short-run baseline (46.33). Given profit $19 >> holding $1, the critical ratio q = 19/(19+1) is high, so we want a higher service level. I therefore set L = default (promised lead time = 0) so the backend treats the review+lead window appropriately. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent regime (Periods 29\u201331) and keep the base-stock responsive to the observed uptick. This increases the mean forecast (and the safety-stock via sigma_hat) to reduce stockouts while accepting modest holding cost increases; that aligns with the high profit-to-holding ratio and current low on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 29\u201331: avg = 61.67 (Periods 29\u201331 demands 67,61,57) vs prior baseline 46.33 (Periods 26\u201328) \u2192 increase \u2248 +33.0%; treat Periods 29\u201331 as new short-run baseline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201332) show every order arrived with lead_time=0 consistently, so use default promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 30\u201332 = 61, 57, 70) suggests the most recent short-run regime has mean \u2248 62.67; carry-over history shows multiple prior regime shifts, most recently captured at Period 32. To keep the OR backend responsive to the latest short-run regime while respecting the promised zero lead time, I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat I choose recent_N with N=3 to anchor the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 3 periods (captures current short-run average ~62.7). For sigma_hat I choose recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility rather than the full-history variance. This combination keeps target base-stock aligned to the current lower-through-moderate demand and reduces excess holding cost risk given on-hand=0 and no in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1046.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Recent on-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show every past order arrived with lead_time=0 (no evidence of lost/delayed shipments), so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Demand history (most recent demands by period): P29\u2013P33 = [67,61,57,70,56]. The most recent short-run regime shows a mean \u224862.2 over the last 5 periods, which is consistent with the near-term pattern after the regime shifts recorded earlier. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select recent_N with N=5 to anchor the base-stock to the immediate 5-period average and volatility (captures the latest regime while smoothing single-period noise). This balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1 implies high target fill rate) against holding cost by focusing the forecast on the current short-run demand level rather than older higher regimes. With on-hand=18 and no pipeline, these parameters will drive orders to refill toward the short-run base-stock implied by the recent 5-period demand estimate while avoiding excessive inventory buildup.

Daily Reward (R_t): $827.00

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 context: on-hand=28, in-transit=0, recent realized lead time has consistently been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has softened: the last 3 observed demands (Periods 32\u201334) = {70, 56, 45} \u2192 recent 3-period avg = 57.0, which is below earlier short-run regimes. No shipments are overdue or in-transit, so we must keep inventory lean to avoid holding cost. Therefore: set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand across the review+lead period (1+L), I use a recent_N=3 estimate (N=3) to capture the latest down-shift in demand as the operational baseline and avoid overstock. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N=3 to reflect current short-run volatility from the same 3 most recent observations. These choices signal the OR engine to target a lower base-stock aligned with the recent demand decline, reducing expected holding cost while preserving service given the confirmed zero lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $962.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Context: confirmed actual lead time = 0 in all concluded periods (P1\u2013P35). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 33\u201335) = [56,45,52], 3-period avg = 51.0 which is meaningfully below the prior short-run baseline (Periods 29\u201331 avg = 61.67). Given the 3-period sustained lower demand, I treat the most recent 3-period regime as the current baseline. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0, fully confirmed historically). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands) (captures the recent down-shift). For volatility I use recent_N N=3 to reflect realized lower variability in the same recent window. This keeps the base-stock targeted to current lower demand and reduces unnecessary ordering/holding cost while preserving service for the current regime. On-hand + pipeline (26+0) covers roughly half of one expected period of recent demand (~51), so the OR backend will produce an order to replenish toward the recent 1-period baseline while capping order size per its cap formula.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Periods 33\u201335: avg = 51.0 (Periods 33\u201335 demands 56,45,52) vs prior baseline 61.67 (Periods 29\u201331) \u2192 decline \u2248 -17.4%; treat Periods 33\u201335 as the new short-run baseline.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 decision. All concluded history (Periods 1\u201336) shows promised lead time = 0 was honored every period (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly), and there are currently on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 34\u201336 = 45, 52, 108) shows a short-run uptick in Period 36 but is noisy; to be responsive while keeping safety stock small (profit $19 vs holding $1 gives high service target), I use a short recent window to set demand forecast and volatility. I set L to default (use promised lead time 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=3 ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 demands) to capture the latest demand regime quickly. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility including the Period 36 spike. These choices bias orders toward meeting near-term demand while limiting long-run overstock given the low holding cost relative to profit; using recent_N keeps the base stock and cap responsive to the recent spike without relying on older lower-demand periods.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201337) consistently show arrived orders with observed lead_time=0, so promised lead time remains valid and there is no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand has jumped (Periods 35\u201337 = 52, 108, 149) compared with the prior short-run baseline (~51 across Periods 33\u201335). This looks like an emerging uptick but is only 3 periods when including Period 35, so I use a short recent window to capture the higher current demand while avoiding over-committing inventory if this is a short blip. Therefore: set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 periods (captures the latest uptick: avg \u2248103). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect realized volatility in those same recent samples. This keeps the OR backend responsive to the recent demand increase (raising base stock and safety stock) while the zero lead time allows same-period replenishment if needed; it balances service level (high profit $19) against low holding cost $1 by focusing on short-run evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2416.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 start. On-hand=54, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 with all concluded orders showing lead_time=0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Recent demand has jumped sharply in Periods 36\u201338 (demands 108,149,130). This 3-period spike appears sustained enough to treat as the current short-run demand baseline. To capture this regime I set L to default (use promised lead time 0). For demand forecast across review+lead (1+L=1) I choose recent_N with N=3 to center the base-stock on the immediate high-demand regime (Periods 36\u201338 avg = 129 units). For volatility I also choose recent_N N=3 so safety stock reflects the higher short-run variability from these three large observations. These parameters push the OR backend to raise order targets to cover the new high-demand regime while the low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19) favors higher service levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Periods 36\u201338: avg = 129.0 (Periods 36\u201338 demands 108,149,130) vs prior short-run avg 51.0 (Periods 33\u201335) \u2192 increase \u2248 +152%; treat Periods 36\u201338 as new short-run baseline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3097.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Recent demand shows a sustained high regime over the last 3 periods (Periods 37\u201339 demands 149,130,172; recent avg \u2248150.33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we are completely exposed to stockouts this period. All concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (every past order arrived same period ordered). Therefore use L method = default (promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast, I treat the most recent 3-period regime as the current baseline because it is a clear, sustained (3 periods) elevation versus prior baseline. So set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to make the OR engine target the elevated mean for the review+lead window. Volatility should reflect recent variability, so set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3. These choices instruct the OR backend to raise the base stock to cover the current high-demand regime while still using the capped order quantity; using recent_N focuses safety stock on the latest confirmed regime and helps balance service level (avoid lost sales during the spike) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 37\u201339: avg = 150.33 (Periods 37\u201339 demands 149,130,172) vs prior short-run baseline 51.0 (Periods 33\u201335) \u2192 large increase; treat Periods 37\u201339 as new short-run baseline.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 decision. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has jumped into a high regime: Periods 38-40 demands = 130, 172, 186 (three-period recent avg \u2248 162.67). Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead-time observations show consistent 0 lead time, so use default lead time to let OR backend assume promised behavior. Because demand clearly shifted upward and the most relevant information is the very recent three periods, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 so the OR engine sizes base stock to this high short-run demand. This choice raises the target base-stock to meet service (profit >> holding cost) while sigma_hat recent_N captures the higher short-run volatility. With on-hand and pipeline at zero, these parameters will prompt ordering to cover expected near-term sales while the capped policy still limits extreme orders.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 decision. Current context: on-hand=74, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 39-41) = [172, 186, 137] \u2014 a short-run high-demand episode with 3-period average \u2248165 units. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in all concluded periods (all past orders arrived same period), so using default promised lead time could be reasonable; however to capture the recent high-demand regime I set demand forecasts using the most recent 3 periods. Profit = $19 and holding = $1 (high profit relative to holding cost) motivates leaning toward higher service level to avoid stockouts. Choices: L = default (use promised lead time = 0) to match observed fast arrivals; mu_hat = recent_N with N=3 to set (1+L)\xd7mean based on last 3 realized demands (captures the recent spike); sigma_hat = recent_N with N=3 to reflect realized volatility over the same short-run regime. This combination gives the OR backend a demand forecast and volatility that prioritize service (higher base stock) given high profit per unit, while keeping lead time consistent with observed arrivals. Also note on-hand + pipeline = 74 \u2014 if actual demand remains at the recent high (~165), we expect the OR engine to place a significant replenishment to cover the (1+L) review+lead period demand.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Recent demand has been elevated over the last several periods (Periods 38\u201342 demands: 130,172,186,137,125) indicating a sustained high-demand regime vs earlier periods. On-hand = 82, in-transit = 0, and there are no overdue/lost shipments in concluded history (all past orders have arrived with observed lead_time = 0). I therefore keep L = default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0-period lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime and reduce stockouts, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (N=5) so the OR backend builds base stock around the most recent 5-period average demand; I match sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher service (reduce lost sales) while still letting the OR engine cap orders using its cap formula to limit overstock and holding cost exposure.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44 decision. Recent demand has been elevated: Periods 41-43 demands = [137,125,132], recent 3-period mean \u2248 131.33 and still higher than long-run historical mean (~93.8). On-hand = 63, in-transit = 0 (no overdue shipments). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in conclude messages (many orders with lead_time 0), so I keep L = default (use promised lead time). To adapt quickly to the recent high-demand regime while limiting holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (recent_N, N=3). This focuses the base-stock on the current elevated demand level and captures recent volatility; with L=0 the backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent. This choice balances service (avoid stockouts given current high demand) against holding cost by not using the longer-run average which would understate current demand.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 decision. Recent history shows repeatedly that actual lead time = 0 (every concluded period reports arrivals in the same period they were ordered). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Demand history has exhibited multiple regime shifts historically, but the most recent concluded periods (P41\u2013P44) show high demand (137,125,132,154) with several periods of stock built and depleted; no sustained new pattern beyond those already recorded. Given the confirmed zero observed lead time across all concluded orders, I will use the promised/default lead time (L = default) so the OR backend relies on same-period replenishment. For demand sizing and volatility I select the backend defaults (mu_hat = default, sigma_hat = default) so it computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all historical samples; this leverages the full sample set while the OR engine's base-stock / cap logic balances the high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) via the q-based safety-stock. Using defaults keeps decisions robust to the many short-run regime shifts already tracked and avoids overfitting to very recent volatile spikes. If we observe missed or delayed arrivals in future conclude messages, I will switch to an explicit or recent_N lead-time estimate and adjust mu_hat accordingly.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46 decision. Recent demand has been volatile but the most recent short-run regime (Periods 43\u201345 demands = 132, 154, 80) is the best indicator for immediate replenishment. On-hand = 78, in-transit = 0 so there are no confirmed arrivals pending; promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0, so use the promised/default lead time. Profit ($19) vs holding ($1) implies a very high target fill probability (q \u2248 0.95) so we need to size stock to meet near-term demand while avoiding excessive holding cost. I select mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast to the latest short-run regime and sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect current observed volatility; L remains default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 periods and there are no lost/delayed shipments to signal a change. This balances service level (capture the recent elevated mean) against holding cost by relying on a short recent window rather than the long-run mean.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 decision. Recent observed demands (most recent 3 periods P44\u2013P46) = [154, 80, 97], recent 3-period average = 110.33. On-hand = 88, in-transit = 0 (no shipments outstanding or overdue). All concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders consistently arrived same period), so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Given volatile recent swings but no sustained new regime (lack of 3+ periods of consistent shift), I use a short recent window to capture the current local mean and volatility. Set L=default so backend uses promised 0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to target (1+L)*recent_mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent_std \u2014 this biases orders toward meeting next-period demand (after decision) while limiting excess holding cost (holding cost is low relative to profit: profit $19 vs holding $1, so backend will favor higher service). With on-hand 88 and mu_hat built from recent mean ~110, pipeline gap suggests ordering to replenish toward base stock but not aggressive overstocking given volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2625.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 start. On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order arrived same period ordered), so promised lead time remains reliable. Recent demand (Periods 45\u201347) = [80, 97, 140], 3-period average = 105.67 \u2014 this reflects a recent uptick (large sale in Period 47) and is the best short-run baseline for replenishment. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded history supports it. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent regime while limiting overreaction to a single extreme: mu_hat recent_N (N=3) makes the backend target (1+L)*recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) uses recent volatility to size safety stock. This balances service level (responding to the recent higher demand) against holding cost given on-hand stock is low and no in-transit cover exists. No new sustained pattern (3+ periods) beyond already-documented insights is being recorded.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. Recent demand (most recent concluded periods): Period_46=97, Period_47=140, Period_48=152 \u2014 a high short-run level versus earlier mid-range volatility. Current inventory: on-hand=5, in-transit=0 so we are essentially stockless going into customer demand this period. Promised lead time in history has consistently concluded as 0 periods, so I use the default promised lead time to let the OR engine treat arrivals as same-period. For demand forecasting I choose recent_N with N=3 (Periods 46\u201348) because the most recent 3-period window shows a clear higher short-run mean that should drive (1+L)-period demand sizing; using these 3 samples captures the latest regime while remaining parsimonious. For volatility I also choose recent_N with N=3 to reflect the short-run variability observed in the same window. This combination (L=default, mu_hat recent_N N=3, sigma_hat recent_N N=3) tells the OR backend to size base-stock and cap using the latest short-run mean/variance and the promised same-period arrivals \u2014 which is appropriate because we have almost no pipeline and profit >> holding cost (q\u22480.95), so the optimizer will target a high service level but using the recent higher demand mean avoids systematic understocking this period.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 decision. Context: on-hand=38, in-transit=0. Promised lead time has been consistently 0 in all concluded periods (every order to date arrived same period), so I use the default promised lead time. Recent demand has been elevated: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 45\u201349) = [80, 97, 140, 152, 140], indicating a materially higher short-run mean than very low mid-series regimes. Profit= $19, Holding = $1 gives a critical fractile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 (high service target). To reflect the recent elevated regime and keep the OR base-stock responsive, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the last 5 demands and balances responsiveness vs noise). Using recent_N for both mean and volatility ensures the backend computes a base_stock tuned to the current high-demand regime while the cap will limit extreme orders. This choice also acknowledges zero in-transit and low on-hand: a recent-N forecast prevents under-ordering into the current high-demand environment while the high service-level (q=0.95) reduces stockouts; using recent volatility ensures the z* buffer is scaled appropriately. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift in concluded history, so no explicit lead-time adjustment is made.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Periods 47\u201349: avg demand = 144.0 (Periods 47\u201349 demands 140,152,140) vs prior short-run baseline \u2248 98 (roughly Periods 43\u201346 avg) \u2192 increase \u2248 +47%; treat Periods 47\u201349 as new short-run baseline.
