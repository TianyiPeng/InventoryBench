To avoid stockout this period, we must order enough to meet Period_1 demand after decision because arrivals may be same-period if lead time=0 but could be delayed; given uncertainty, order to cover one period of expected demand. e) Final order logic: use historical average demand \u224894 units as the best unbiased forecast for the upcoming period. Holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so modest overage is acceptable but excessive inventory increases holding cost without benefit. Therefore place order for 95 units to satisfy expected Period_1 demand and earn profit if sold.",

Actual Period 1 demand (observed in conclude) was 124, indicating a one-period high drawdown and a stockout (sold 95 of 124 demanded). With limited data, safest forecast leans toward the recent higher observations (Period 1 actual=124 and sample P2=113). I target the upper end of that range to avoid lost sales.\nc) Lead time & missing orders: Period 1 order (95) arrived in Period 1 with lead_time=0 periods (conclude states arrived=95, ordered on Period 1, lead_time was 0). That means orders placed this decision phase will arrive during the same period before demand is realized. No evidence of lost/delayed shipments yet.\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Given lead_time=0, any order placed now will be available for Period 2 demand. There is no incoming pipeline to rely on.\ne) Final order logic: Balance service level versus holding cost. Profit per unit is high ($19) relative to holding cost ($1/period), so overstocking slightly above expected demand is acceptable to avoid lost sales.

The three-period sample shows a downward sequence but small-sample noise is possible. Sample mean = 84 units, sample std \u2248 28.9 units.\n\nc) Lead time / arrivals: Historical conclude messages show every order arrived the same period it was placed (Period1,2,3 orders had lead_time=0). Therefore actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods; an order placed now will arrive before demand is resolved this period.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 41, in-transit = 0. No overdue or in-transit shipments to account for.\n\ne) Final order logic: Use a single-period newsvendor approach. Understock cost (lost profit) = $19/unit, overstock cost (one-period holding) = $1/unit -> critical ratio = 19/(19+1)=0.95. Approximate the 95% demand quantile assuming normality: target stock \u2248 mean + 1.645*std \u2248 84 + 1.645*28.9 \u2248 132 units. With 41 on-hand, order = 132 - 41 = 91 units (round to integer).

No in-transit or on-hand inventory now. d) Inventory logic: Because lead time = 0, we can place an order that will arrive this period and satisfy Period 7 demand.

Given the observed high recent volatility and elevated mean, it's optimal to bias toward stocking enough to satisfy high demand rather than risking stockout. e) Final order logic: Forecast ~139 units for Period 44 (recent average). Because holding cost is low relative to profit and demand showed spikes up to 180 recently, place an order sized to cover likely high demand.
