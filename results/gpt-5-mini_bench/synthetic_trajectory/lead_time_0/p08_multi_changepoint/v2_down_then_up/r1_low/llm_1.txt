No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time; orders placed now may arrive same period or may be delayed/lost. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit, so excess inventory is costly. e) Final order logic: To maximize expected reward (Profit\xd7units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost\xd7ending_inventory) we aim to match expected demand for the current period while avoiding large safety stock because holding cost equals profit. Using the historical mean \u224894 units as the best unbiased forecast for Period_1 demand, I place an order for 94 units. This balances the chance of selling units this period against the high holding cost if they remain unsold. If actual lead time>0 and the order doesn't arrive this period, we'll observe that in future conclude messages and adapt orders then.",

That confirms at least one-period evidence of 0 promised lead time being honored. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. With actual lead time observed = 0 (arrival in same period), orders placed now will arrive in this same period after the decision and can satisfy Period 2 demand. e) Forecast & order logic: Because holding cost equals profit ($1/unit per period), carrying excess inventory into the next period yields no net benefit and directly reduces objective if unsold.

I use the 5-period average (91.6) rounded to 92 units as the forecast for Period 6, slightly above the recent 3-period mean to cover the observed variability (not enough evidence of a regime change).

More relevant are the conclude-period sold quantities (actual sales fulfilled when inventory existed): P1 sold 94, P2 sold 71, P3 sold 57, P4 sold 84, P5 sold 89, P6 sold 92. Recent observed demand that matters for forecasting (periods 4\u20136) shows sales of 84, 89, 92 \u2014 averaging ~88\u201392 units. c) Lead time / missing orders: Carry-over shows lead time confirmed = 0 periods (arrivals occur same period ordered). All conclude messages from P1\u2013P6 show arrived same period as ordered, so we can rely on same-period replenishment. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0.

Because holding cost per period equals profit per unit, carrying inventory into future periods yields no net benefit (it eats the profit if not sold immediately). Therefore we should order to closely match expected demand for the current period to maximize units sold while avoiding ending inventory.

Earlier periods included several high-demand observations as well. Given this mixed evidence, a short-horizon forecast should weight the most recent periods more heavily; I therefore target a forecast near the recent 3-period average (~124) but moderate slightly toward the 7-period average (~99) to avoid excessive overstock.\n\nc) Lead time / shipments: Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive same period). In-transit = 0 and there are no overdue shipments.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 4, in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive in time to meet this period's demand (and will be visible in the next period's conclude).

Recent history shows all orders arriving same period, and in-transit = 0 now. No evidence of lost or delayed shipments.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 19, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, any order placed this decision will arrive during Period 18 before demand, allowing us to target expected demand precisely and avoid ending inventory.

Therefore we should avoid positive ending inventory while meeting expected demand.\n\ne) Final order logic: Forecast demand for Period 18 = conservative estimate near the recent central tendency. Using recent medians/averages (median-ish ~98, 6-period average ~95.5, 3-period average lower but more volatile), I choose to order to target total available inventory \u2248 98 units to meet expected demand while leaving minimal ending inventory. With on-hand 19, order = 98 - 19 = 79 would top up to 98. However, because lead time = 0 (order arrives same period) and we want to supply demand without increasing ending inventory, we should order equal to expected demand and allow on-hand to be used first. To be explicit and simple, I place an order of 98 units so total available for Period 18 demand is 19 (on-hand) + 98 (arriving) = 117, which safely covers the forecast while allowing some buffer for variability. Given holding cost parity with profit, a small buffer is acceptable but we avoid large overstock.\n\nNet decision: order 98 units (arriving this period).",
