Recent samples show a modest downward trend but still centered near ~100 units. c) Lead time / missing orders: supplier promised LT=0 but actual LT is unknown; no concluded arrivals history to confirm. Because orders placed now may arrive either same-period (LT=0) or later (LT>=1), we must balance risk. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so without an arriving order this period we will stockout. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($19/unit), so modest over-ordering to avoid lost sales is appropriate. e) Order logic: target roughly the recent mean demand (~107). Rounding up to provide a small safety buffer given LT uncertainty and to avoid lost sales, place order for 110 units. This quantity gives a high chance to meet current-period demand if LT=0, and provides initial pipeline if LT>0. Monitor concluded arrivals in future periods to infer actual lead time and adjust future orders.",

These two points show variability but are insufficient to declare a sustained regime shift (require >=3 periods). A simple short-run forecast is the recent mean: (107+149)/2 = 128 units. The separate historical sample set in the problem statement (130,122,106,108,71) also centers around ~110\u2013130 historically, which is consistent with a ~120\u2013130 short-term expectation.\n\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Concluded messages show orders placed in Period_1 and Period_2 both arrived in the same period (lead_time = 0 observed twice). This is evidence that supplier delivered same-period twice, but per carry-over rules we require sustained (3+ periods) evidence before recording as a carry-over insight.

Because lead time appears to be 0, any order placed now will arrive during Period_3 and can satisfy Period_3 demand.\n\ne) Final order logic: Holding cost ($1/unit/period) is small relative to profit ($19/unit), so the cost of a small overstock is low compared to lost profit from stockouts.

The 5-period average = 104.2 units. There is no sustained upward or downward shift; variability is moderate and last three periods (125,101,107) center near ~111 but one high spike (125) makes the mean slightly higher.

Demand is variable (observed range 98\u2013222) but the multi-period average centers near ~145 units.\n\nc) Lead-time and orders: Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201326) consistently show arrived = ordered in the same period; lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods (already recorded in carry-over). There are currently no in-transit units and on-hand = 0.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: With lead time = 0, any order placed in Period 27 will arrive during Period 27 and be available to meet Period 27 demand (demand occurs after decision). Holding cost is $1/unit/period while profit per sold unit is $19. Given high profit relative to holding cost, the penalty for slight over-ordering is small compared to lost profit from stockouts. However demand variability argues against ordering excessively above expected demand.\n\ne) Final order logic: Target ordering to satisfy expected Period_27 demand with a modest buffer. Using the robust recent average (~145 units) and weighting recency, I set the order slightly above the average to reduce stockout risk given high profit per unit. Therefore I order 160 units this period (arrives same period) to maximize expected profit while keeping ending inventory modest.\n",
