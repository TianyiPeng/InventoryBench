Average = 92.2 units/period; no sustained upward or downward shift visible (values fluctuate around this mean). c) Lead time & missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0, but there is no concluded arrival history yet to confirm actual lead time; therefore we cannot rely on same-period arrival certainty. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Because current-period demand occurs after the order decision and actual lead time is unknown, ordering to exactly cover the expected demand for the immediate period balances service level and holding cost. Holding cost equals per-unit profit, so carrying inventory beyond expected near-term demand yields no net benefit. e) Final order logic: use the recent average demand (\u224892 units) as the forecast for the current period and order that amount to aim to meet demand without incurring unnecessary holding cost. If future periods reveal actual lead time >0, adjust orders then.",

This indicates same-period arrivals have occurred twice; therefore an order placed now will arrive during Period 3 and can satisfy Period 3 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so no coverage for Period 3 without ordering.

A forecast near 100 units captures recent higher-demand periods (including P15=113) while limiting the risk of paying holding cost on unsold units.

Recent demand (Periods 39-43 = 14, 8, 51, 32, 35) is volatile but centers near ~28 units. Using the most recent 5-period average gives 28 units; 3- and 7-period averages are similar enough given volatility. c) Lead time / shipments: Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrive same period). No in-transit or overdue orders. d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order placed now will arrive this period and can meet current-period demand. e) Order logic: Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1/period. That means carrying extra units into subsequent periods yields no net expected benefit; overstock is costly (holding erodes profit dollar-for-dollar). Therefore we should order to closely match expected period demand with minimal safety stock. Forecasting next-period demand \u2248 28 units (5-period average). I place an order for 28 units to meet expected demand while avoiding unnecessary holding cost.",

Lead time & pipeline: Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time = 0) and there is currently no in-transit or on-hand inventory, so any order placed now will arrive this period and be available to meet Period 45 demand. Demand forecast: Use recent realized demand (concluded Periods 40\u201344 = [8,51,32,35,53]). Average of last 5 = 35.8 units. These are observed customer demands (not censored by stockouts), so they are the best estimate. Objective math: Profit = $1 per unit sold; Holding cost = $1 per unit of ending inventory per period. Because lead time = 0, we can avoid carrying inventory between periods by ordering to match expected demand exactly; excess on-hand at period end incurs a holding cost equal to the profit per unit, so over-ordering directly reduces reward. Recommendation: order to match the forecasted demand for Period 45. Round the 5-period average to nearest whole unit (36) to balance small sampling noise and avoid systematic lost sales from low orders.",
