Mean demand \u2248 93 units/period with moderate variability (range 61\u2013144). No sustained regime shift is visible from these five samples.\nc) Lead-time / missing orders: Promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time is unknown. No conclude messages are yet available to confirm realized lead time. Because orders placed this decision may or may not arrive within the same period, there is execution risk. Conservatively assume the supplier can often deliver same-period (promised 0) but remain prepared for possible delays\u2014this will be inferred once conclude messages appear.\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. To meet expected period demand without on-hand stock we must place an order now. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals the unit profit $1, so carrying inventory across periods is costly; therefore avoid significant over-ordering that would create leftover stock.\ne) Final order logic: Use the historical mean (~93) as the best single-period demand forecast and order that quantity to attempt to satisfy Period_1 demand. This balances service (capture expected sales, $1 profit per unit sold) against high holding cost that discourages overstock. Given lead-time uncertainty, I keep the order size close to the single-period expected demand rather than ordering extra safety stock.\n",

Recent 5-period demand (Periods 39\u201343): 79, 72, 81, 31, 67 \u2014 mean = 66. Short-term demand appears moderate with occasional dips (P42=31) but no sustained upward or downward shift. c) Lead time & orders: Past concluded messages (including Period 23) confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive within the same period). There are no in-transit or overdue orders to consider. d) Inventory & costs: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Profit = $1/unit, Holding cost = $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is very expensive (one period of holding erases the profit from one sale). That argues for minimal safety stock and ordering to match expected period demand. e) Final order logic: With confirmed 0 lead time, an order placed now will arrive before demand this period, so we should order to match expected demand for Period 44. Using the recent mean (~66) and a small round-up to guard against small upside variability, I order 70 units. This balances service (capture sales) against high holding cost (avoid excess ending inventory).",

With lead time = 0, orders placed this decision phase arrive in time to satisfy Period_46 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 33, in-transit = 0.

Because arrivals are same-period, order only the shortfall between forecast and on-hand to avoid holding cost: order = max(0, 57 \u2212 33) = 24 units.
