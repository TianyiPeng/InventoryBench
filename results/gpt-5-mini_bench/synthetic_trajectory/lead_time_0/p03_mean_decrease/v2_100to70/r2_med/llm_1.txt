The 5-period average demand = 93 units/period. Recent points show variability (range 61\u2013144) but no sustained shift. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promises 0 periods but actual lead time is unknown. Since arrivals are only observed via conclude messages in later periods, we must assume the order may arrive same period (L=0) or may take longer (L>=1) or could be lost. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Current period demand will occur after this decision; therefore we should order enough to cover current-period demand even if actual lead time ends up being 0. e) Final order logic: Balancing high unit profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1/period) and demand uncertainty, I use the 5-period average (\u224893) as the demand forecast for this period and round up a small safety buffer for variability. Ordering 100 units aims to meet expected demand this period while keeping excess modest given holding cost and uncertain future demand. If the order fails to arrive this period (actual lead time >0), we risk a stockout this period; however without evidence of multi-period delays we must rely on the forecast. Summary: order 100 to cover expected demand (~93) with a small buffer.",

Recent several periods show an average around mid-60s.\n\nc) Lead time vs. missing orders: Carry-over insight from Period 4 confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods. All orders historically have arrived same period; no evidence of lost shipments. With lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive during the current period before demand is satisfied.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. No pipeline coverage; we must order to meet expected demand this period.\n\ne) Final order logic: Because orders arrive same period, we should order to cover expected demand for this period rather than stocking large safety inventory (holding cost = $1/unit/period is high relative to profit per unit $4). Forecast demand \u2248 65\u201367 units. To balance service level vs holding cost given volatility, choose a single-period order equal to the demand mean (conservative given holding cost) rather than a larger safety buffer. Therefore order 67 units to target expected sales while avoiding excess end-of-period holding cost.",
