Base stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 = 109 + 1.645\xd714.56 \u2248 133 units. The OR cap uses the same inputs for L=0, so OR's capped recommendation of 133 matches the theoretical base-stock result.\nRisk considerations: Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($19), so overstock risk is modest. We have zero visibility into arrivals (no in-transit) and cannot detect lead-time deviations yet; therefore we should not deviate from a statistically justified base-stock order on the first period. If orders later fail to conclude or arrivals are delayed, we will adjust future orders accordingly.\nDecision: Place order = 133 units (follow OR). This covers expected single-period demand plus safety stock consistent with the profit/holding tradeoff and the historical demand variability. No carry-over insight is generated because we lack 3+ periods of sustained new evidence about demand or lead time.\nImplementation note: Monitor Period 1 conclude in Period 2 for any arrived=... message to detect actual lead time or lost shipments; update policy if arrivals deviate from promised lead time or demand shifts emerge.",

Step 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 31, in-transit = 0. Historical demand samples used by OR (and shown in the environment) give a relatively high target; observed Period 1 demand was 102, which is in line with the historical magnitudes.

Step 3 \u2014 OR recommendation review: OR recommends 99 units using the capped base-stock formula (it uses promised L and full history). Given actual lead time = 0 (matching the OR assumption here), no lost shipments, and a Period 1 realized demand ~102, OR's suggested order of 99 is coherent with the current on-hand (31) to bring available inventory to a level suitable for the high service target. Step 4 \u2014 Decision and risk trade-offs: With lead time = 0, orders placed now will be available for today's demand; holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($19), so the downside of slight over-ordering is small compared with stockout risk.

This matches the supplier's promised lead time of 0 periods. No contrary evidence exists.\n2) Inventory & pipeline: Starting Period 3 on-hand = 43, in-transit = 0. With lead_time=0, any order placed now will arrive during Period 3 (and be available to meet Period 3 demand), though the arrival will only be visible in the Period 3 conclude message.\n3) Demand outlook: The OR baseline (which uses historical demand samples and the promised lead time) recommends 86 units. OR's policy incorporates a high critical fractile: profit $19 vs holding $1 gives q=19/20=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645, which produces meaningful safety stock to avoid stockouts. Recent realised demands (102 then 87) average ~95 \u2014 OR's 86 is reasonable given its cap and smoothing.\n4) Trade-offs: Holding cost is very low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($19/unit), so the cost of carrying extra stock is small compared to lost profit from stockouts. We have modest on-hand (43) and no pipeline, so ordering is needed to cover expected demand and safety stock.\n5) Decision: Follow the OR recommendation of 86 units. This brings available inventory during Period 3 to 43 + 86 = 129 units to satisfy Period 3 demand and retain safety stock for volatility. Given confirmed lead time=0 and the high profit-to-holding ratio, following OR's capped base-stock order is justified.\n6) Risk notes: If upcoming periods show a sustained drop/increase in demand or any lost shipments, we will revise strategy.

That is consistent, sustained evidence that actual lead time = 0 periods (matches promised L=0).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 3, in-transit = 0. With confirmed lead time 0, any order placed now will arrive during this period and can be used to satisfy Period 4 demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand estimate & OR comparison: Historical demand samples give single-period mean \u03bc\u0304 = (118+124+116+96+91)/5 = 109 and sample std \u2248 14.56.

OR uses the full-historical mean and the promised lead time; it does not detect lead-time anomalies or lost shipments, but here actual lead time equals promised.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Tradeoffs and final decision: Profit per unit is $19, holding cost $1 \u2014 critical fractile q=19/20=0.95, which justifies stocking to high service levels. Given sustained lead-time=0, low current on-hand (3), and an expected single-period demand \u2248109 (with variance), placing an order near OR's recommended level makes sense to avoid stockouts and capture high margin sales. Ordering 130 units will arrive this period, producing approx 133 units available to meet demand; that closely matches OR's computed base-stock (~133) while respecting OR's cap.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk/holding consideration: With expected demand ~109, expected ending inventory would be ~24 units (holding cost $1 each) \u2014 acceptable given the high per-unit profit.

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history (Periods 1\u20136) shows every order arrived in the same period it was placed (arrived on Period X for orders placed on Period X). Period 4 already recorded the confirmation; continued Periods 5\u20136 arrivals are consistent with lead_time = 0. Therefore orders placed now will arrive during this same period and can be used to satisfy Period 7 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory / pipeline: Current on-hand = 44, in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, any order placed in this decision phase will be available for Period 7 demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Two demand summaries are informative: (A) the provided historical samples (Period_1..5 = 118,124,116,96,91) give mean \u2248109 and sample std \u224814.6; (B) the most recent realized demands (Periods 1\u20136 concluded: 102,87,126,88,115,88) give a mean \u2248101. Both point to roughly 100\u2013110 units expected this period. There is no calendar/seasonal signal or sustained regime shift (needs 3+ periods of consistent change) that would justify deviating strongly from this range.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation and baseline math: OR recommends 87 units. OR uses a capped base-stock policy with critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645. Using the provided historical samples (mean \u2248109, \u03c3\u224814.6) and promised L=0, the uncapped base stock would be ~133 units (109 + 1.645\xd714.6). That implies ordering \u2248133 \u2212 pipeline. However OR's final capped result is 87 \u2014 likely smoothing/capping behavior to limit large single orders.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Trade-offs & final decision: Profit per sold unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1/period), so missing sales (stockouts) is costly vs. the relatively small holding cost for extra inventory. Given confirmed lead time = 0 (so ordered units are usable immediately) and the demand expectation \u2248100\u2013110, we want on-hand + order to be near the expected demand plus safety. With on-hand 44, ordering OR's recommended 87 brings available inventory to 131, which is enough to cover the upper estimate (\u2248109) and provides safety stock consistent with a high critical fractile. Ordering 87 balances: (a) meets likely demand, (b) follows OR\u2019s capped smoothing, and (c.1) avoids unnecessary extra holding but (c.2) accepts some holding because forgone sales are much more expensive.\n\nTherefore I accept the OR recommendation and order 87 units. This uses the confirmed 0-period lead time, current on-hand of 44, and the high profit/low holding-cost ratio to prioritize full demand coverage this period.\n",

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Periods 1\u20137 conclude messages consistently show orders arriving in the same period they were placed (lead_time = 0), matching the carry-over insight recorded in Period 4. Therefore an order placed now will arrive before demand is realized this period and will immediately augment on-hand stock.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory position: Current on-hand = 55, in-transit = 0 (but any new order will arrive this period because lead_time = 0).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand estimate (recent evidence): Use recent realized demands (Periods 3\u20137 = 126, 88, 115, 88, 76). Recent 5-period mean = (126+88+115+88+76)/5 = 98.6 units. Variability is moderate, but there is no evidence of a sustained upward or downward regime shift across 3+ periods; demand has trended down slightly from the 126/115 peaks to 76, but not enough to declare a sustained new regime.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 75 units. OR uses historical averages and a safety buffer; it does not account for observed lead_time=0 explicitly beyond promised L and it uses all history equally. With lead_time=0 we can be tighter: we only need to ensure on-hand + order \u2248 one-period demand (L+1 = 1) plus modest safety because orders arrive same period.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final target & order computation: Target stock for this period set to ~100 units (rounded from recent mean 98.6) to cover expected demand and modest variability. Current on-hand = 55, so order = 100 \u2212 55 = 45 units. This is lower than OR's 75 because (a) confirmed lead_time=0 allows smaller pipeline buffer, (b) recent mean \u224899 does not justify OR's larger cap-driven quantity, and (c) holding cost is low but profit per sale ($19) strongly favors meeting expected demand rather than overstocking. Ordering 45 keeps expected fill high while minimizing holding cost.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk notes: If demand surprises on the upside (e.g., another 120+ period), we may undershoot and lose sales this period \u2014 but with lead_time=0 we can respond next period quickly. If multiple periods show sustained higher demand (3+ periods), we will record a carry-over insight and increase targets.\n\nConclusion: Place order of 45 units to bring available stock to ~100, aligning supply with recent demand while leveraging confirmed same-period arrivals.",

Historical demands (Periods 1\u20139) = [102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88, 76, 95, 77]. Sample mean \u03bc\u0304 \u2248 94.9 units/period and sample std \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 16.8.

OR\u2019s base-stock calculation (using q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/20 = 0.95 \u21d2 z* \u2248 1.645) yields base_stock \u2248 94.9 + 1.645\xd716.8 \u2248 122.5.

Demand mean (~95) is significantly above current on-hand (52), so ordering to restore the high service-level base-stock is appropriate.

Using the OR's logic with confirmed L=0 and a high critical fractile (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 q=19/20=0.95; z*\u22481.645), the base-stock target = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 = 86.4 + 1.645\xd79.56 \u2248 102.1 units.\n\nPipeline & order math: Current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) = 32 + 0 = 32.

Given confirmed same-period arrivals and that recent 5-period mean is below OR's implicit mean, I will order to meet the calculated base-stock gap rather than accept OR's higher suggestion\u2014this reduces unnecessary holding cost while still aiming for the 95% service level.\n\nDecision and risk considerations: Holding cost is low ($1) vs large profit ($19), so erring slightly on the upside is acceptable, but the OR's 95 would create materially more inventory than recent demand justifies. Ordering 70 units brings on-hand+arrival to ~102 units which aligns with the 95% service target based on current demand volatility. Because lead time = 0, this order will be available to meet Period 11 demand immediately.\n\nFinal strategy: Order 70 units (rounding order_raw down from 70.1).

Therefore orders placed this Decision Phase will arrive later in this same period before demand is realized.\n\nInventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 11, in-transit = 0. Use recent realized demand to form my short-term forecast: last 5 periods (P8-P12) demands = [95,77,96,78,90], mean = 87.2, sample std \u2248 9.15. With lead time L=0, the (1+L)-period demand mean \u03bc\u0302 = 87.2 and \u03c3\u0302 = 9.15.\n\nOR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 114 units (uses full history and promised lead time). Recomputing the capped base-stock for recent demand: critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/(19+1)=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645.

OR's recommendation of 114 is higher than the recent-data driven base-stock approach because OR uses a longer/fuller history (higher mean). Given current low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19) the service-level target (95%) supports a meaningful safety stock, but ordering up to OR's 114 would raise holding cost without strong recent-demand evidence of increased demand.\n\nFinal strategy: Order 91 units (rounding 91.3 down to 91). Rationale: with lead time confirmed 0 the order will arrive before demand this period; recent 5-period average demand \u224887 and the z* safety stock implies a base-stock around 102.3, so topping up pipeline to that level requires ordering ~91 units now given only 11 on hand. This balances the high profit-driven service-level with the observed modest recent demand, avoiding unnecessary holding cost from following OR's higher 114 recommendation.

Holding cost is small relative to profit, so erring on the side of more stock to avoid lost sales is appropriate.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 OR adjustment decision: Given (a) confirmed lead time = 0 so the order will serve current demand, (b) on-hand = 0, (c) recent mean demand \u224894.5 and variability consistent with OR\u2019s implicit \u03c3, and (d) high profit / low holding cost favoring service, I will follow the OR recommendation of 125 units. This covers expected demand plus safety stock to target the 95% service level the OR intended.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk notes: If upcoming calendar events or a sustained regime shift appear in future periods (3+ periods of change), I will update the carry-over insight and adjust order sizing.

Concluded-period history (P1\u2013P14) consistently shows arrived = ordered in the same period, so I treat lead time as 0 for planning. \n2) Demand analysis: Use realized demand history P1\u2013P14 (demands: 102,87,126,88,115,88,76,95,77,96,78,90,110,82). The 14-period average demand \u2248 93.6 units/period with sample standard deviation \u2248 15.0. Demand appears variable but with no clear sustained regime shift. \n3) OR recommendation: OR recommends 82 units (it uses promised lead time and its capped base-stock). Given lead time = 0, we only need to cover one period of demand (L+1 = 1). \n4) Service level / target stock: Profit = $19, Holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 \u21d2 z \u2248 1.645.

Given holding cost is low ($1) vs profit ($19), being a little conservative (ordering slightly more) is acceptable, but I prefer matching the base-stock math using observed mean and sd rather than the OR cap which smooths swings. Also there is no evidence of a sustained demand surge to justify ordering above the base-stock target. \n7) Risk trade-offs: Ordering 76 gives a high service level (\u224895%) while avoiding excess holding cost over multiple periods.

OR uses a high critical fractile (q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 \u2192 z\u22481.645), so its cap and base-stock logic already aim to avoid stockouts; its 83 is roughly in line with (mean \u2212 on-hand) plus a modest safety add-on.

The carry-over insight already recorded lead time = 0 (confirmed). I therefore believe actual lead time = 0 and orders placed now will arrive in this period's arrival resolution and be available to satisfy demand this period.\n\n2) Inventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 79, in-transit = 0. Recent realized single-period demands (Periods 13\u201317) are [110, 82, 112, 78, 53] with an average \u224887 and clearly variable (range 53\u2013112). Given the product economics (Profit = $19, Holding = $1), the OR uses a high service target (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, z*\u22481.645) which implies keeping meaningful safety stock.\n\n3) OR recommendation & assessment: OR recommends ordering 47 units. With on-hand 79 + OR order 47 \u2192 126 units available this period. That level comfortably covers the recent mean demand (~87) plus safety buffer implied by q=0.95, while keeping holding cost low ($1/unit/period). Because lead time is 0, we do not need to protect for pipeline; ordering now immediately increases available inventory for this period's demand.\n\n4) Decision and justification: I accept OR's recommendation of 47 units. It raises available stock to ~126, which aligns with recent peak demands (~110\u2013112) and the high critical-fractile target driven by the high profit per unit. Ordering substantially more would increase holding cost for inventory that is not likely to sell before future periods and is unnecessary given the 0 lead time and current on-hand balance.\n\n5) Risk notes: If we observe several consecutive periods of demand >120, we should revise orders upward; conversely, if demand weakens (<70 consistently), reduce orders.

The most recent 4 periods (P16\u2013P19) average \u2248 52.8 units/period, materially below the long-run mean.\n- OR baseline: recommends 84 units based on older history and promised lead time; OR does not account for the recent downward shift in demand.\n- Demand volatility: recent sample standard deviation is elevated (~31.5) so there is uncertainty; however the mean has clearly dropped for multiple consecutive periods (4 periods), which suggests a sustained downshift that should reduce ordering.\nDecision logic and final quantity:\n- With lead time = 0, we should target a same-period on-hand level that covers expected demand plus a modest safety buffer. Using the recent regime (P16\u2013P19) gives a recent mean \u224853 and high sd; using the high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95) would normally push toward large safety stock, but that risks excessive holding cost given the clear downward demand shift.\n- I therefore set a moderate target stock around 116 units (recent mean + 1.645\xd7recent sd would be ~116), but this fully reflects the high uncertainty; to be more conservative on holding cost and avoid large overstocks given the downward trend, I choose a smaller replenishment. With on-hand 46, ordering 70 units brings total available to 116 (46+70), matching the risk-adjusted target while keeping order size moderate.\n- This action is a compromise: it reduces OR's suggested 84 down to 70 to reflect the sustained lower demand, but still provides ample coverage in case of volatility this period.\nRisks and notes:\n- If demand rebounds to the earlier high mean (~109), we will start depleting inventory; monitor next 2\u20133 periods for confirmation.

Including Period 20 (demand=86) gives a recent 5-period average (P16\u2013P20) = (78+53+30+50+86)/5 = 59.4 units. Current on-hand = 30, in-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, any order placed now will immediately augment on-hand for this period's sales.\n\nOR recommendation comparison: OR suggests ordering 99 units based on historical (higher) demand and promised lead time.

Ordering 99 would create significant ending inventory and increase holding cost without proportional increase in sales given current lower demand.\n\nFinal strategy and quantity: I target covering expected near-term demand represented by the recent 5-period average (~59\u201360 units) plus a modest safety buffer because profit per unit is high ($19) and holding cost is low ($1). Target on-hand after arrival \u2248 65\u201370 units. With current on-hand = 30, I therefore order 40 units (bringing on-hand to 70 when the order arrives this period). This balances avoiding stockouts in case demand rebounds toward the recent higher observation (86 in P20) while avoiding overstock given the sustained drop since P16.\n\nRisk notes: If demand reverts to the earlier long-run mean (~100), we will understock this period, but recent evidence (multiple low-demand periods) suggests keeping inventory lean is preferable. If next-period concludes show higher demand consistently (\u22653 periods), I will increase orders and record a new carry-over insight.\n",

Period 22 (Period_22) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (P1\u2192P1, P2\u2192P2, ... P21\u2192P21). That means any order placed now will arrive during this same period's arrival resolution and be available for demand this period, and we'll see confirmation in the period-conclude we read next period.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 4, in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, any new order will immediately add to on-hand (for the upcoming demand that occurs after the decision phase).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: Long-run historical mean (first five-sample summary used by OR) was ~109, but carry-over insight already recorded a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 16 with a much lower average (~52.8 over P16\u2013P19). Recent realized demands: P19=50, P20=86, P21=66. These three periods average \u224867; the four-period average flagged earlier (P16\u2013P19 \u224852.8) shows the regime drop is real compared to the earlier high mean. There is no durable return to the old 109 level: the last three periods imply moderate recovery but still well below OR's baseline inputs.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation critique: OR recommends 124 units because it uses the older larger mean and the promised lead time, producing a large base-stock. Given actual lead time=0 and the sustained lower-demand regime, OR's 124 would likely create excess holding cost without proportional extra sales.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision logic & numbers: We need enough stock to serve the upcoming period(s). With lead time = 0, the relevant coverage horizon is (L+1)=1 period. Recent single-period demand expectation is best estimated from recent periods (conservative blend of recent average \u224867 and the earlier 4-period low \u224852.8). Given profit per unit = $19 and holding cost = $1, the critical fractile is high (q=19/20=0.95), which argues for some safety stock. But because we observed a structural downshift, I avoid OR's large order. I choose to order 60 units: combined with on-hand 4 that yields 64 units available \u2014 enough to satisfy an expected demand in the mid-60s while keeping on-hand small to limit holding cost if demand remains subdued.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk trade-offs: Ordering 60 balances missed-sales risk (high profit) against holding cost. If demand returns to ~85\u2013110, we'll risk stockouts next periods, but that would be corrected by future orders (lead time=0 allows fast correction). If demand stays low, 60 avoids unnecessary inventory.\n\nStep 7 \u2014 Summary action: Place order for 60 units now (arrives same period). No new carry-over insight is recorded because the previously noted regime shift is already in carry-over and no new sustained pattern (>=3 periods) beyond that was newly established.\n",

That means any order placed now will arrive during this period and is available to satisfy Period 23 demand. There are no in-transit units. Current on-hand = 27.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: OR's recommendation (102) is based on older/higher historical means. Recent realized demand has shifted materially downward: sustained lower demand was already recorded (carry-over insight from Period 20: a regime shift starting around Period 16). The most recent four actual demands (Periods 19\u201322) = 50, 86, 66, 37 \u2192 avg \u2248 59.8. A conservative short-term demand forecast for Period 23 \u2248 60 units (I use the recent-period average, giving more weight to post-shift behavior).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Risk trade-offs and target inventory: Profit per unit = $19; holding cost = $1 per unit/period \u2192 critical fractile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 (highly penalty-averse), but because the regime has shifted lower and lead time = 0 (we can top up instantly), I prefer a small safety buffer instead of matching OR's much larger safety stock. Target available units \u2248 60 (expected demand) + modest safety \u2248 6 \u2192 target \u2248 66 units.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Order calculation: target 66 \u2212 on-hand 27 = 39 units to order now. This gives ample coverage for expected demand while limiting holding cost exposure if demand stays low. It also leverages same-period arrivals so we avoid provisioning multi-period pipeline stock.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Why not follow OR: OR\u2019s base-stock used older higher demand samples and the promised lead time assumption; it overstates required stock given confirmed lead_time=0 and the observed sustained drop in demand. Ordering 39 balances stockout risk (high profit per unit) against holding cost and observed lower demand.\n\nOverall: place order = 39 units (arrives this period), expected ending inventory roughly = on-hand + arrived \u2212 demand \u2248 27+39\u2212~60 \u2248 6 units, limiting holding cost while meeting expected sales.",

Therefore an order placed now will be available to meet Period 24 demand. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 46, in-transit = 0. Recent demand picture: Periods 20\u201323 demands = [86, 66, 37, 20], 4-period average \u2248 52.3 and sample std \u2248 29.5. This matches the previously recorded sustained demand regime shift (Period 16 onward) to a much lower mean than the long-run (~109). OR recommendation: 85 units (OR uses long-run history and promised lead time). Why I adjust: OR's 85 assumes higher historical demand and produces a higher base-stock; given the confirmed lead time=0 and a sustained drop in demand across multiple periods (4+ periods), following OR would create unnecessary holding cost. Decision logic & quantity: Targeting enough on-hand to cover expected demand plus risk buffer for same-period replenishment capability. Using the recent mean (\u224852.3) and the high critical-fractile z* (profit/(profit+holding)=19/20 \u2192 q\u22480.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645) yields a conservative base-stock around 100 units, but holding cost is low ($1) versus high profit; however given the abrupt sustained demand decline and the ability to replenish within the period (L=0), I prefer a smaller replenishment to avoid excess inventory. On-hand 46 already covers most of the expected demand; I will order 55 units bringing available inventory this period to 101 (46 + 55) which: - Covers expected demand (~52) comfortably and provides a safety cushion against volatility without matching OR's larger order that assumes the old high-demand regime. - Balances penalty of stockouts (high profit) with avoidance of ongoing holding cost on obsolete higher stock. Risk management: With lead-time = 0, we can react quickly next period if demand surprises upward; we avoid large persistent holdings if low demand continues. Operational note vs. OR cap: This 55-unit order is a downward adjustment from OR's 85 due to observed regime shift and the confirmed zero lead-time allowing smaller, more frequent replenishment. ",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed lead time = 0 (from carry-over: P1..P3 arrivals same-period and Period 4 confirmation). Therefore any order placed now would arrive within the same period's arrival resolution (but you only see it in the conclude message). No in-transit inventory is outstanding.\n\nInventory & recent demand analysis: On-hand = 65, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand (from concluded periods) shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 16. Last four concluded periods (P21\u2013P24) demands = 66, 37, 20, 36 with average = 39.75 units/period. That recent average is well below the historical long-run levels OR may be using. A 1-period coverage target using the recent mean is ~40 units; current on-hand (65) already covers ~1.6 periods of expected demand.\n\nOR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 66 units. OR uses older historical samples and the promised lead time; its critical fractile (profit/(profit+holding)=0.95) pushes it to hold high safety stock. However, OR does not account for the observed sustained demand drop since Period 16 nor the fact we already hold 65 units with lead time = 0. Ordering 66 would push ending inventory to ~131 and generate substantial holding cost each period without corresponding demand to justify it.\n\nRisk/benefit: Profit per sale is large ($19), but ordering excess now mainly creates holding cost ($1/unit/period) and increases risk of overstock while recent demand remains low. With lead time = 0, we can respond quickly to any reversal in demand next period, so maintaining flexibility is preferable.\n\nFinal decision: Do not order this period (order = 0). This keeps inventory near current demand cover (65 \u2248 1.6\xd7 recent mean), avoids unnecessary holding cost, and preserves ability to reorder quickly if demand rebounds.

With lead time 0, any order placed now will arrive during Period 26 and can satisfy Period 26 demand, so we only need to cover one period of demand plus a modest safety stock.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: Recent realized demand has fallen substantially versus the early-history high. The most recent four concluded periods (P22\u2013P25) demands = [37, 20, 36, 51], mean = 36 units/period, sample std \u2248 12.7.

That recommendation is far above the recent-demand signal and would produce large holding cost because we already observe sustained lower demand.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Target base-stock calculation (my short-term policy): For L=0, target base stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 with z* appropriate for critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201328) shows every order arrived same-period (arrivals recorded as ordered on same Period), so actual lead time = 0 (matches prior carry-over insight). Therefore orders placed now will arrive in time for current-period demand. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 17, in-transit = 0. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 16 (carry-over insight): recent 4-period demands (P25\u2013P28 = 51, 52, 58, 48) average \u224852.25 with sample std \u22484.24. Given the sustained lower-demand regime, I rely on recent demand rather than the long-run high-demand history. OR recommendation (111) is based on long-run history and promised L; it overestimates needed inventory given the confirmed lower regime and 0 lead time. OR-style base-stock calculation using recent data and OR parameters: single-period mean \u03bc \u224852.25, \u03c3 \u22484.24.

The OR cap would be near the same base_stock for L=0, so cap does not bind here. Final strategy: Order 42 units. This brings expected available inventory (on-hand + arrival) near the service-level base stock (~59), matching a high service level appropriate given high per-unit profit and low holding cost, while avoiding the large over-order implied by the OR\u2019s long-run estimates.

Therefore use L=0. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 4, in-transit = 0. Recent demand has clearly shifted to a lower regime (carry-over insight recorded at Period 20: recent 4-period average \u224852.8). I focused on the most recent 5 demands (Periods 25\u201329 = 51, 52, 58, 48, 55) which give mean \u03bc = 52.8 and sample std \u03c3 \u2248 3.84.

Why deviate from OR (123): OR uses long-run history and promised assumptions; it recommends a large order reflecting earlier high-demand periods. Recent data (multiple periods) show a sustained ~51\u201353 mean, so ordering near OR's suggestion risks high holding costs. Final strategy: order 55 units to bring on-hand closer to a 95%-service base-stock for the observed low-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding cost. This keeps us well-covered for expected single-period demand given L=0, but does not overstock against the earlier high-demand regime. Short-term risk: if demand reverts upward suddenly, stockouts may occur; however prior history shows the low regime sustained for many periods, making this conservative and cost-effective.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201330) repeatedly shows orders arriving in the same period they were placed (e.g., 'ordered Pn, arrived Pn'), so actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier in carry-over insights). This means any order placed now will arrive during the current period and can satisfy current-period demand. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so we must order to meet this period's expected demand. Demand analysis: The long-run high-demand regime has clearly shifted down and was recorded previously (carry-over: demand regime shift at Period 16). Recent realized demands (Periods 26\u201330 = 52, 58, 48, 55, 62) average 55 units with sample SD \u2248 5.39. OR recommendation: OR suggests 126 units (uses older/historical data and the promised lead time). OR also targets a high service level because q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/20 = 0.95, implying z* \u2248 1.645. Adjustment reasoning: Because actual lead time = 0 and demand has been persistently lower (~55 recent mean across 5 periods), ordering OR's 126 would create excessive holding cost for little extra profit. With L=0 a single-period forecast is appropriate. Calculate base stock using recent stats: \u03bc \u2248 55, \u03c3 \u2248 5.39, safety = z*\xb7\u03c3 \u2248 1.645\xb75.39 \u2248 8.9 \u2192 recommended order \u2248 55 + 8.9 \u2248 64 units.

This minimizes holding cost given the confirmed low-demand regime while keeping a ~95% service-level buffer implied by profit/holding ratio.

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 34, in-transit = 0. Historical earlier-era mean \u2248109 is no longer representative \u2014 carry-over insight recorded a demand regime shift starting at Period 16 with a much lower sustained mean (~52.8). Recent realized demand (Periods 27\u201331 = 58,48,55,62,30) gives a 5-period average \u224850.6 and a 4-period average (P28\u2013P31) \u224848.8.

On-hand = 30, in-transit = 0, so current pipeline_inventory = 30.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand outlook: Recent realized demands have been well below the early high-run: the long history shows a sustained lower-demand regime beginning around Period 16. Focusing on the most recent five periods (P28\u2013P32 demands = 48, 55, 62, 30, 24) gives an empirical mean \u2248 43.8 units and sample std \u2248 16.3 units.

Current pipeline_inventory = on-hand + in-transit = 30. order_raw = 71 \u2212 30 = 41 units. Rounding and slight buffer for variability suggests ordering 41 units now.

With lead time 0 the order will arrive in Period 33 and be available for Period 33 demand.\n\nRisk notes: If demand suddenly spikes back toward earlier levels (>100), this order will understock; however, the history since Period 16 shows a persistent drop (~\u221251% relative to early-run), and recent five-period mean near 44 supports a lower order.

Inventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 52, in-transit = 0, so physically available before demand resolution = 52 units. Historical demand has shifted down from the early high-100s to a much lower regime (carry-over insight: Period 16 regime shift; recent multi-period demands commonly in the 20\u201380 range, with several periods near ~50). The OR baseline recommends 73 units using long-run historical stats and promised lead time; that recommendation likely targets a higher mean demand (\u2248100s) and is therefore too aggressive given the sustained lower-demand regime observed since Period 16. Risk trade-offs: Profit/holding tradeoff yields a high critical fractile (q = 19/20 = 0.95), which motivates safety stock, but ordering aggressively now would create unnecessary holding cost because current on-hand (52) already covers the expected one-period demand (~50) and lead time is 0 (no pipeline risk). Final strategy: Do not order this period (order = 0). Rationale: with lead time = 0, our decision affects only current-period arrivals (which would be visible immediately in end-of-period conclude) but we already have ~1 period of expected demand on-hand. Ordering would increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) while marginally reducing a small stockout risk that is already low given current inventory. Therefore override OR's 73 \u2192 0 to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining adequate coverage for current expected demand. If next period demand shows sustained increase, place orders then (we will re-evaluate with the next conclude message).",

Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so any order placed now will arrive during Period 36 and be available for Period 36 demand. Recent realized demand (most relevant data) is: P31=30, P32=24, P33=63, P34=18, P35=60. The 5-period average = 39 units; sample standard deviation \u2248 21 units. OR recommended 124 units based on long-run history and the promised lead time; that recommendation is too large given the sustained lower-demand regime observed since Period 16 and the recent sample mean/variance. \n\nQuantitative decision reasoning: With profit = $19 and holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645.

Since there is no pipeline and arrivals are same-period, ordering 74 will bring on-hand up to ~74 before demand is realized and matches the base-stock target appropriate for current demand and risk preference. This reduces risk of stockouts relative to ordering strictly the mean while avoiding the large overstock implied by OR's long-run-based 124. \n\nPractical considerations and risk: There is some volatility (\u03c3 \u2248 21) and occasional spikes (e.g., 63 and 60), so 74 still leaves a nonzero chance of a stockout if demand spikes above ~74. But holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit, and lead time is 0 so we can react next period to any surprise sustained change. Given the confirmed low-demand regime since Period 16 and the most recent 5-period mean of 39, ordering to the computed base-stock (74) balances profit and holding cost better than OR's 124. \n\nAction: Place order for 74 units (arrives this period).",

Orders arrive same period they are placed; there is no in-transit pipeline (In-transit = 0) and arrivals will be visible only in the period conclude message. Inventory position: On-hand = 30, In-transit = 0. Demand outlook: Recent periods after the documented regime shift remain at a much lower level than the long-run: Periods 16\u201319 average \u224852.8 and more recent actual demands (P35\u2013P38: 60*,34,69,55 with P35 partially stock-limited) cluster around ~50\u201360 units. Given this sustained lower regime, expected single-period demand is near ~53\u201360 units rather than the earlier ~109. OR recommendation: OR recommends 92 units because it uses the historical long-run statistics and the promised L; its critical fractile (profit/(profit+holding)=19/20=0.95) produces a high safety stock. Adjustment logic: With lead time = 0, we only need to ensure on-hand + order \u2248 one-period demand plus a conservative safety buffer. We already have 30 on-hand; ordering ~30 more brings available stock this period to ~60, which aligns with the observed recent demand (\u224853\u201360) and avoids excessive holding cost (holding cost = $1/unit/period is non-trivial).

This lower-demand regime has persisted for many periods and was already recorded as a carry-over insight at Period 20, so I treat it as the active regime.\n- OR recommendation: OR suggests 121 units (uses older/higher historical mean and promised lead time). Its policy uses a high critical fractile (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95, z*\u22481.645) and thus proposes strong safety stock for a larger assumed mean.\n\nDecision logic and calculations:\n- Target service level remains high (q\u22480.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645) because profit >> holding cost.\n- Use recent demand as the best forecast: single-period demand \u03bc \u224855 (based on P36\u2013P39 avg).

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded-history shows lead time = 0 (multiple confirmed arrivals same period). Therefore an order placed now will arrive during this period and be available for period demand. There is no in-transit inventory. \n\nStep 2 \u2014 Recent demand & regime: Recent realized demands (Periods 38\u201341 = 55, 60, 65, 44) average \u224856 units. This is well below the early-period samples OR used. The earlier carry-over insight already recorded the sustained lower-demand regime (Period 16 shift); recent data continue to show single-period demand in the mid-50s. \n\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory position and service tradeoff: Current on-hand = 35. Since lead time = 0, ordering replaces what we need for this period and next. Profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), so OR's high critical fractile pushes toward more safety stock; however given the sustained lower demand (\u224856) and holding cost each period, keeping excessive on-hand inventory unnecessarily increases holding penalties over remaining horizon. \n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision math and adjustment from OR: OR recommends 85 units (based on long-run historical mean and promised lead time). With on-hand 35 and no pipeline, ordering OR's 85 would raise available stock to 120, which is ~2\xd7 current expected demand and would incur extra holding cost. I set a target to cover the expected single-period demand (~56) plus modest safety (\u224820% buffer \u224811 units) to reduce stockout risk while limiting holding cost. Target availability \u224867\u201370 units. With 35 on-hand, that implies an order of ~32\u201335. I choose a slightly conservative increase to ensure coverage against variability and rounding considerations and to align with the profit/holding tradeoff: order 50 units. \n\nOutcome: After arrival this period, on-hand will be 85 (35+50), exceeding expected demand (~56) but substantially lower than OR's 120-level plan. This maintains high service probability given profit-holding tradeoff while reducing unnecessary holding costs.",

Carry-over already recorded: lead time confirmed as 0 periods. Assume L=0 for planning.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: Current on-hand = 34, in-transit = 0. Any order placed this period will arrive during this same period's arrival resolution (but arrival will only be visible in the conclude message next period).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: The long-run dataset used by OR is different from the recent realized demand. The carry-over insight already noted a sustained drop in demand around Period 16. Recent realized demand (Periods 39\u201343) = [62, 65, 44, 50, 26], 5-period mean = 49.4 units, sample SD \u2248 15.7. This recent mean is the best anchor for near-term demand because lead time is 0 and demand regime has been persistently lower.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 85 units based on historical data and the promised lead time. That recommendation overshoots the current demand regime: using recent mean (~49.4) plus safety stock (z*=\u03a6\u22121(0.95)=1.645 \u2192 safety \u2248 1.645\xd715.7 \u2248 25.8) gives a base-stock \u224875.2 units.

OR's cap and older-demand weighting push its recommendation to 85, but that ignores the confirmed lower-demand regime.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final action and justification: I order 41 units (rounded from 41.2). This restores on-hand + arrival to roughly the base-stock implied by recent demand and a 95% critical fractile, while avoiding excessive holding cost from following OR's larger 85-unit recommendation. Numerical summary: plan covers expected single-period demand (~49.4) plus safety (~25.8) targeting base-stock \u224875; 34 on-hand + 41 ordered \u224875.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk management: Because lead time is 0, if demand unexpectedly spikes we can respond in the same period in future decisions.

There is no in-transit inventory and no delayed/lost shipments visible.\n2) Current inventory position: on-hand = 33, in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive in the same period's arrival resolution and will be available for demand this period (and visible in next period's conclude message).\n3) Demand outlook: Recent realized demand has been well below the early-period highs. Last five observed demands (Periods 40\u201344) = [65, 44, 50, 26, 42], average \u224845.4 units. This recent pattern is sustained relative to long-run highs and indicates a lower demand regime than the OR's long-run based calculation.\n4) OR recommendation context: OR suggests 85 units, driven by a high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 -> q\u22480.95) and historical variability. That policy assumes higher mean demand and uses promised lead time but cannot adapt quickly to the observed lower recent demand.\n5) Decision logic: With lead time = 0 and current on-hand 33, I only need to top up approximately to expected period demand to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding cost. Targeting around the recent single-period demand mean (~45) implies ordering about 12 units. To be slightly conservative for variability, I round up modestly.\n6) Final action: order 15 units for chips(Regular). This yields an available stock \u224848 for this period, balancing near-term sales capture (avoid lost sales) against holding cost exposure from over-ordering. It is a scaled-down override of OR's 85 because OR overestimates demand under the current lower-demand regime.\n\nSummary of tradeoffs considered: confirmed lead time = 0 (so same-period arrival), no pipeline, recent mean demand \u224845, high profit/low holding would normally push OR to large safety stock but recent data justify a much smaller order to avoid unnecessary holding costs.",

  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Concluded history shows lead time is 0 periods (confirmed repeatedly in carry-over). That means any order placed now will arrive during Period 46 in time to satisfy Period 46 demand.\n\nInventory & pipeline: On-hand = 6, in-transit = 0, so available to meet Period 46 demand without further arrivals would be 6 units. We must order to cover the remainder of expected Period 46 demand.\n\nDemand assessment: The long-run history shows a previously recorded drop around Period 16 (carry-over). More recently demand has fallen again: Periods 42\u201345 demands = [50, 26, 42, 42], 4-period average = 40 units. Looking at the last 10 periods (P36\u2013P45) the average \u224848.9 with an estimated std \u224813.9; however the most recent 4 periods average 40 and suggest a downward drift versus the earlier reduced-regime mean of \u224852.8. Given we have only lead time 0 and only 5 periods remaining in the horizon (Period 46\u201350), I put more weight on the most recent 4 periods for the immediate-order decision.\n\nOR recommendation check: OR recommends 112 units (uses longer history and promised L). That is materially higher than recent realized demand (recent 4-period avg = 40) and would create large ending inventory and holding costs in the remaining horizon. OR's cap is not appropriate here because it ignores the recent downward trend.\n\nOrdering decision logic: With lead time = 0 we need order + on-hand to cover one period's coverage (current-period demand). I target a conservative buffer above the recent mean: recent mean \u224840; adding a modest safety buffer given sigma \u224814 would add ~1.0\xd7\u03c3 \u224814 \u2192 target stock \u224854. Given on-hand 6, that implies ordering \u224848. However, because remaining horizon is short (Periods 46\u201350), I reduce the safety buffer to avoid excessive holding and order 60 units to preserve some upside if demand reverts up slightly. This order equals meeting the recent mean (40) plus an extra ~20 units of upside protection; with on-hand 6 this brings available inventory this period to 66 units (order arrives same period), which is a conservative stocking but well below OR's 112 recommendation.\n\nFinal action: Order 60 units. This reduces risk of stockouts relative to relying on only 6 on-hand, but materially cuts OR's high recommendation to avoid excess ending inventory across the remaining horizon.\n\nRisk notes: If demand remains at the lower end (~26), this will create extra holding in later periods; if demand rebounds toward the 50\u201365 range seen earlier, this order reduces lost sales. Because lead time is 0 and holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), a modest precautionary order is justified, but OR's 112 is too large given recent downward drift and short remaining horizon.",

Promised lead time = 0 and actual lead time is confirmed as 0 (consistent with carry-over insight recorded in Period 4). Therefore an order placed now (Period 47) will arrive during Period 47 and will be available to satisfy Period 47 demand.\n\nInventory & recent demand analysis: On-hand = 28, in-transit = 0. Recent realized single-period demands (P42\u2013P46) = [50, 26, 42, 42, 38]; the 5-period mean = 39.6 and sample std \u2248 8.8. The most recent 4-period avg (P43\u2013P46) = 37, consistent with the previously recorded reduced-demand regime (carry-over insights: demand regime change starting around Period 42 with lower averages). This lower regime appears sustained through Period 46.\n\nOR recommendation comparison: OR suggests ordering 89 units based on long-run historical stats and using the promised lead time; OR does not account for the evident sustained drop in demand since Period 16 and further reduction around Period 42. Because actual lead time = 0, we can safely place a smaller order to match current single-period needs without pipeline buffer.\n\nTarget policy and final quantity rationale: Using a base-stock style target computed from recent observations (single-period mean \u224839.6, std \u22488.8) and the critical fractile implied safety factor z* = \u03a6\u22121(19/(19+1)) = \u03a6\u22121(0.95) \u22481.645, a short-term base-stock \u2248 mean + z*\xb7std \u2248 39.6 + 1.645\xb78.8 \u2248 54 units.

This choice balances (a) the high profit per unit (so we want to avoid stockouts) and (b) the clearly lower sustained demand regime (so we avoid excess holding cost). Because lead time = 0, the 26 units will arrive in time for Period 47 demand.\n\nRisk considerations: If demand unexpectedly spikes back toward historical highs (e.g., values near 100+), we risk stockouts, but historical spikes have not been sustained for 3+ periods and carry-over insight requires conservatism. Given holding cost is low ($1/unit) and profit high ($19/unit), ordering to reach the recent base-stock (rather than OR's large recommendation) is a prudent trade-off.\n\nConclusion: Order 26 units to bring available inventory to ~54 units (on-hand after arrival = 28 + 26 = 54), which covers expected demand plus a safety buffer derived from recent variance and the high critical fractile.",

Using a critical fractile approach (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645) applied to the recent demand statistics: base_stock \u2248 \u03bc + z*\u03c3 \u2248 45.5 + 1.645\xd79.85 \u2248 61.7. Since on-hand + pipeline = 0, order_raw \u2248 62. This provides ~95% service against recent variability while keeping holding costs low. The OR cap is unnecessary here because OR's cap would be based on larger historical variance and a higher \u03bc, which would again push quantity upward unnecessarily.\n\nRisk notes: If demand reverts upward suddenly, 62 may produce occasional stockouts and lost sales; however, given the strong evidence of a sustained lower regime (already recorded) and the high profit vs low holding cost, prioritizing availability for the expected demand level with a modest safety buffer is appropriate. If upcoming periods show a sustained uptick (3+ periods), we'll increase orders and record a new carry-over insight.\n",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history confirms lead time = 0 (multiple periods show orders arriving same period ordered). Therefore any order placed now will arrive during this period and can satisfy Period 49 demand. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so no coverage for current demand. Demand analysis: recent periods show a sustained lower-demand regime compared with the very early history. Looking at the most recent 5 periods (P44\u2013P48) demands = [42, 42, 38, 60, 64], 5-period mean \u2248 49.2 units and sample std \u2248 11.9. OR recommendation of 116 units is based on long-run history and the promised lead time; it therefore overshoots current realized demand. Policy and adjustment: with zero lead time, base-stock for one period is \u03bc + z*\u03c3 where z* for q=profit/(profit+holding)=19/20=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645. Using recent stats gives base_stock \u2248 49.2 + 1.645\xd711.9 \u2248 69 units. Pipeline is zero so order_raw \u2248 69; the OR cap (also based on long-run stats) would be similar when using recent estimates. Given low holding cost ($1) vs high profit ($19) it is acceptable to err slightly high, but ordering OR's 116 would create unnecessary holding cost against a visibly lower-demand regime. Final action: order 70 units (rounding base-stock up to cover a modest upside). This covers expected demand (\u224849\u201351) plus safety stock for variability while avoiding the large surplus implied by OR's long-run estimate. Short-term risk: if demand unexpectedly reverts to much higher historical levels, some stockouts could occur in future periods, but given multiple recent periods of lower demand and confirmed zero lead time, the prudent choice is to follow recent demand-driven base-stock ~70 rather than OR's 116.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201349) confirms actual lead time = 0 (arrivals always in same period). No lost shipments visible.\nInventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 29, in-transit = 0, so available before demand in this period = 29. Recent realized demand has settled well below the long-run early-era levels: the latest 4-period average (Periods 46\u201349) = (38+60+64+41)/4 = 50.75 units. This is consistent with earlier reduced-regime averages (~52.8) recorded in carry-over insights; there is no clear new sustained shift upward or downward.\nOR recommendation check: OR recommends 86 units using its capped base-stock policy and the promised lead time. OR assumes larger demand uncertainty and uses the high critical fractile (profit/(profit+holding)=19/20=0.95 \u2192 z\u22481.645), which inflates safety stock. With lead time = 0 and current on-hand = 29, ordering OR\u2019s 86 would create a large ending inventory relative to expected demand and incur unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period).\nFinal strategy & calculation: With lead time 0, we only need to cover expected single-period demand plus modest safety. Use the recent single-period mean \u224850.8 as the demand forecast. Target on-hand at time of demand \u2248 51\u201356 units. With on-hand 29, order = target \u2212 on-hand. I choose a conservative target of 55 units (slightly above the recent mean to avoid a stockout on a higher-than-average demand day) \u2192 order = 55 \u2212 29 = 26 units. This balances capturing nearly all expected sales (\u224851 expected) while keeping ending inventory and holding cost low. It also departs from OR downward because OR\u2019s safety buffer is unnecessary when lead time = 0 and recent demand is consistently in the ~50 range.\nRisk notes: If demand unexpectedly spikes above ~80, we may stockout this period; however, ordering more would raise holding cost on this low-variance, lower-demand regime. If we observe 3+ periods of a sustained change (up or down), we will record a carry-over insight and adjust policy accordingly.",
