Recent two periods (P4=96, P5=91) are lower but sample is short; not yet a sustained shift. c) Lead-time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time is unknown. No concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time or losses. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Because arrivals happen after the decision phase, an order will only satisfy Period 1 demand if actual lead time = 0; if actual lead time \u22651 the order will arrive later. e) Final order logic: Expected demand this period \u2248109 units. Per-unit profit ($4) exceeds per-period holding cost ($1), so understocking causes lost high-margin sales while modest overstocking incurs relatively small holding cost. To balance service and holding, place an order slightly above the expected mean to reduce stockout risk should lead time turn out to be 0. If lead time >0 the order will shift to future periods but will not be deductible now. Therefore order 120 units.",
