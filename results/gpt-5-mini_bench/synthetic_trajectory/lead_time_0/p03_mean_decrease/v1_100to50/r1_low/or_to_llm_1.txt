Do not assume lost shipments or longer lead time.\n\nDemand outlook & risk tradeoffs: Recent two observations (Periods 4\u20135: 96 and 91) show a modest down-tick versus earlier values, but this is only a 2-period pattern\u2014below the 3+ period threshold for recording a sustained regime change. Given profit = holding cost, the critical fractile q=0.5 implies symmetric cost of over- vs. under-stocking; the OR baseline (109) equals the long-run sample mean and balances expected sales vs. holding cost.\n\nDecision: Follow the OR recommendation and order 109 units. Rationale: (1) OR's math matches the empirical mean from the provided samples; (2) no confirmed lead-time deviation or lost shipments to force ordering earlier or more; (3) recent slight downward drift is not sustained enough to confidently reduce order \u2014 with equal profit and holding cost, being conservative and matching the sample mean is appropriate.\n\nImplementation detail: Place order of 109 units now.

With promised lead time L=0 the OR base-stock target is \u2248109 (\u03bc\u0302 = 1\xd7109). OR applied its capping and returned 101 units (slightly below the raw base-stock calculation).

That is consistent evidence (3 periods) that actual lead time = 0, so orders placed now will arrive during the same period's arrival resolution and will be available to satisfy demand this period (and will be visible in the next period's conclude message).\n\nInventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we have no buffer. Recent realized demand (sales or attempted demand) over the last three periods: Period1 demand 102 (sold 102), Period2 demand 87 (sold 87), Period3 demand 126 (sold 95 due to stockout). The sample mean of realized demand over these 3 periods \u2248 105 units. There is variability with a high demand episode in Period3; OR's recommendation (108 units) is essentially at the recent mean and the OR policy uses a critical fractile of 0.5 (profit = holding cost), so it targets expected demand without extra safety stock.\n\nOR comparison and decision logic: OR recommends 108 units. Given: (a) confirmed lead time = 0 so same-period arrival will be available to meet Period4 demand; (b) demand mean \u2248105 with one high-demand period (126) but holding cost equals profit, so carrying extra inventory is expensive and the optimal fractile is near 0.5; (c) pipeline = 0 so we must order to avoid a stockout.

  "rationale": "Summary of observations and reasoning:\n1) Lead time inference: Concluded history (Periods 1-4) shows orders arriving in the same period they were placed (e.g., P1 order arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, etc.). Promised lead time = 0 is confirmed in carry-over; so any order placed this decision phase will arrive during this period and be available for Period 5 demand.\n\n2) Inventory position: On-hand = 20, In-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, new order will immediately augment on-hand before demand.\n\n3) Demand estimate: Use recent realized demand (concluded periods) as the best indicator: Period1\u20134 demands = 102, 87, 126, 88. Mean = 100.75 \u2248 101 units per period. The OR baseline used longer historical samples and recommended 86 units; that recommendation implicitly assumes a lower target inventory position. Because profit = holding cost ($1/$1), the critical fractile is 0.5 (z*\u22480), so the policy centers on the mean demand.\n\n4) Order calculation: With expected demand \u2248101 and current on-hand 20, we need roughly 101 \u2212 20 = 81 units to cover expected period demand without intentionally building extra safety stock. Given high holding cost (equal to profit), I avoid overshooting the mean. The OR recommendation (86) is close; I reduce slightly to reflect the most recent mean (\u2248101 rather than the older longer-run mean) and to limit holding cost exposure.\n\n5) Risk considerations: Demand has been variable (one high 126 in Period 3). However, the signal for a sustained regime shift is not yet strong (only one high spike). Because holding cost equals profit, extra units are expensive to carry\u2014so I prefer matching expected demand rather than adding safety stock. If I observed multiple consecutive high-demand periods (\u22653) I would increase orders.\n\nFinal action: Order 81 units for chips(Regular).

Demand analysis: use concluded period demands (P1\u2013P5 = 102, 87, 126, 88, 115). Empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 = 103.6 units/period; sample std dev \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 16.98.

That means any order placed now will arrive during Period 8 before demand is realized, so the order directly supplements on-hand for Period 8 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: Use the most recent realized demands (Period 1\u20137 concludes): 102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88, 76. Mean demand over those 7 periods = 97.4 units/period. The provided earlier 5-sample historical dataset (118,124,116,96,91) has mean 109, but recent realized data (including lower values in P6\u2013P7) suggests a modest downward move; I therefore weight recent realized mean more heavily. No calendar events or product-seasonal signals are present.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation check: OR recommended 78 units. OR uses promised L and historical samples and produced a capped order; its internal base-stock (using 5-sample mean 109) minus pipeline (on-hand 25) gives an uncapped order around 84, then capped to 78. OR did not incorporate the most recent realized demand pattern (7-period mean \u224897).\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision logic: With profit = holding cost, the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* \u2248 0, so base-stock ought to be roughly the single-period mean. Given confirmed L=0, desired on-hand at the start of demand = target mean \u224897.4. Current on-hand = 25 and in-transit = 0; since orders will arrive same period, order_needed \u2248 97.4 \u2212 25 = 72.4 \u2192 round to 72 units. This is slightly below OR's 78 because I prioritize the recent realized mean (97.4) over the older 5-sample mean (109) used by OR, and because holding cost equals profit so I avoid excess inventory.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final strategy: Place order of 72 units so expected available stock before demand \u2248 97 (25 + 72). This balances stockout risk (meeting roughly mean demand) with holding cost sensitivity (equal to profit). Monitor next few periods; if demand consistently runs above 97 for 3+ periods, increase target accordingly.\n",

There are no overdue or lost shipments to account for.\n\nDemand analysis: Use the observed sales history (Periods 1\u20138 concluded): [102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88, 76, 95]. Sum = 777; sample mean = 777/8 = 97.125 units/period. Recent demands show moderate variability but no sustained regime shift (values mostly between mid\u201070s and mid\u2010120s). With profit = holding cost ($1 vs $1), the critical fractile is 0.5, so target stock should be near the demand mean for the review period.\n\nOR recommendation: OR recommends 100 units (it uses historical demand and promised lead time). Its recommendation closely matches the observed mean demand (\u224897). Because lead time is confirmed 0 and there are no pipeline arrivals, the OR recommendation is appropriate: ordering ~100 will cover expected Period 9 demand while not building excessive inventory.\n\nDecision & quantitative justification: Place order = 100 units. That yields starting available inventory (2 on-hand + 100 arriving) = 102 units to meet expected demand \u224897. This choice minimizes expected lost sales while avoiding large unnecessary holding (profit and holding cost are equal, so overstocking provides no advantage). The small buffer of +3 units above the 97 mean offers slight protection versus demand volatility without incurring large holding costs.\n\nRisk notes: If demand were to spike above ~102 this period, we will incur some stockout risk; if demand falls sharply, holding cost will offset profit and reduce reward.

Cost calculus and OR baseline: profit = $1/unit and holding = $1/unit-period implies critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z* \u2248 0, so the base-stock target for a (1+L)-period horizon is simply the mean demand.

With L=0 the pipeline we care about for the immediate demand is effectively on-hand + order (arrival is immediate).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: The OR baseline used long-run history; recent realized demand in the last five concluded periods (Periods 8\u201312) is: 95, 77, 96, 78, 90 \u2192 mean = 87.2 units. The older five-sample historical set provided in the environment has a higher mean (~109), but recent data show a sustained lower-demand regime over the last 5 periods. This recent mean is a better anchor for the next-period target because demand appears lower and there is no evidence of a new spike.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation review: OR recommends 79 units.

This confirms actual lead time = 0 (matches the previously recorded carry-over insight from Period 4). There are currently no in-transit units and on-hand = 0, so any order placed now will arrive during the current period's arrival resolution and will be available for current-period demand (but that arrival will only be visible in the Period N conclude message).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: Use the observed demand history (Periods 1\u201313): [102, 87, 126, 88, 115, 88, 76, 95, 77, 96, 78, 90, 110].

To avoid unnecessary holding cost while satisfying expected demand, I will order 95 units (rounded to the nearest whole unit). This slightly trims OR's recommendation (99 \u2192 95) to better match the observed mean demand (~94.5) while keeping a small cushion for variability. If I observed a sustained rise in demand over multiple periods (3+ periods consistently higher), I would increase orders; if demand falls for 3+ periods, I would reduce orders.

With lead time 0, ordering today increases on-hand before demand. Expected demand \u2248 94; ordering to meet expected demand minimizes costly excess holding (holding cost=$1/unit equals profit=$1/unit, so leftover inventory reduces reward one-to-one).

Orders placed this period will arrive within the same period and be visible in the period conclude message. There are currently 41 on-hand and 0 in-transit.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand statistics (OR baseline inputs): Using the provided historical samples (118, 124, 116, 96, 91): empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 = 109.0 units/period. Sample standard deviation \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 14.56 units. With promised L=0 the review+lead demand mean \u03bc\u0302 = 109 and \u03c3\u0302 = 14.56.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR policy math check: Profit = $1, Holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 = 109. Pipeline inventory = on-hand + in-transit = 41. Uncapped order_raw = base_stock \u2212 pipeline = 109 \u2212 41 = 68 units. OR also applies a cap (using 95% service term) which in this case would be about 109 + 1.645\xd714.56 \u2248 133, so the cap does not restrict 68. (The provided OR recommendation is 55 units; that is slightly more conservative than the simple base-stock gap calculation above.)\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Demand regime & calendar: Recent realized demand is variable (examples: P13=110, P14=82, P15=112, P16=78, P17=53). There is no sustained (\u22653 periods) regime shift upward or downward: volatility is present but no multi-period signal of a new mean. Given holding cost equals profit, overstocking is costly and we should be conservative.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final decision logic: Because lead time = 0 (so no pipeline lag risk), demands are variable but show no sustained shift, and holding costs are high (equal to profit), I will accept the OR's conservative recommendation. Although a strict base-stock gap suggests ordering 68 to reach 109, the OR recommended 55 (slightly lower) reduces holding exposure while still replenishing inventory enough to cover expected demand in typical periods. With on-hand 41 + order 55 = 96 available this period, which is reasonably close to the mean (109) given demand variability and equal holding/profit trade-off.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk assessment: If we see several consecutive periods of high demand (sustained >+20% of mean), we should increase orders toward the full base_stock gap (\u224868). If demand stays low for several periods, we'll reduce orders to avoid holding costs.\n",

Recent realized demands show a clear downward shift versus earlier periods. Using the most relevant recent window (Periods 14\u201318 demands = 82, 112, 78, 53, 30) the average single-period demand \u2248 (82+112+78+53+30)/5 = 355/5 = 71 units. With lead time 0, we only need to cover expected Period 19 demand. Expected demand \u2248 71; on-hand already 66, so expected shortfall \u2248 5 units.\n\nOR recommendation comparison: OR recommended 27 units. OR uses older historical samples and the promised lead time; it does not adapt quickly to the recent downward demand trend. Given profit = holding cost, any extra unit that remains unsold at period end penalizes us equally to the profit from a sold unit, so over-ordering is costly. We prefer to match expected demand rather than follow OR's higher order.\n\nFinal strategy: Order 5 units to bring available inventory to roughly expected demand (66 + 5 \u2248 71). This minimizes expected ending inventory while covering the expected sales. If demand surprises upward, we will observe arrivals/sales in the conclude message and can adapt next period (lead time is 0 so replenishment is immediate in future periods as well).\n\nRisk/uncertainty: If demand volatility is higher than estimated, we may incur a small stockout. However, given the recent multi-period downward trend (53 and 30 in the last two periods) the conservative approach of ordering only the expected shortfall is appropriate when profit and holding cost are equal.\n",

Calculation and final action: target expected demand for this period \u2248 44 units. With 21 on hand, we need about 23 units to reach that expected demand (44 \u2212 21 = 23).

Current visible state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order placed now will arrive during this same period's arrival resolution and be available for demand this period (but arrival visibility will appear in the Period 22 conclude message).\n\nDemand assessment: The OR baseline recommends 90 units using promised L and long-run historical demand. However the game-provided carry-over insight records a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 17 with recent average (P17\u2013P19) \u2248 44.3 vs earlier mean \u2248109. Looking at the most recent sell/true-demand data: P17 sold 53, P18 sold 30, P19 sold 50; P20 and P21 show censored sales (inventory-limited) but indicate no clear reversion to the earlier high-demand regime. Given the sustained drop for at least 3 periods and continued low sales, the best estimate for one-period demand is ~44\u201350 units.\n\nEconomic tradeoffs: Profit per unit = $1 and holding cost = $1 per unit per period \u2192 critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 (z* = 0). That means we should target the central estimate (mean/median) for one-period demand rather than large safety stock. Because lead time = 0, we need to cover only this period's demand (L+1 =1).\n\nDecision vs OR: OR's cap and base-stock logic produce 90 units, which is appropriate under the historical-high regime but would create excessive ending inventory and holding cost under the confirmed low-demand regime. I will therefore reduce the order to cover approximately the recent one-period demand estimate (\u224844.3) and round conservatively to 45 units to avoid stockouts while minimizing holding cost. This balances lost-sales profit vs holding penalty (both $1). With on-hand=0 and no pipeline, ordering 45 units gives expected sold \u224844\u201345 and minimal expected ending inventory.

The previously recorded demand regime shift (Period 17\u201319 avg \u2248 44.3 vs historical \u2248109) remains the dominant signal: demand is substantially lower than early-period levels and more variable but still far below the long-run historical mean. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1), so the critical fractile q = 0.5 and the OR baseline effectively targets the mean demand; holding is costly relative to benefit, so avoid overstock.\n\nOR recommendation: OR suggests ordering 80 units (uses promised lead time and full historical data). That recommendation appears high relative to the recent low-demand regime and would likely produce unnecessary holding cost given current on-hand inventory.\n\nDecision & calculation: With lead time = 0, an order arrives immediately and supplements the 8 on-hand before demand. I target coverage near the recent single-period average ~54 but err slightly conservative because of variability and equal holding/profit costs. Planned total available stock for the period \u2248 8 (on-hand) + order. To aim for ~54 expected demand, order = 54 \u2212 8 \u2248 46; rounding to a practical integer and keeping a small safety buffer, I order 50 units.\n\nFinal strategy: Order 50 units (reduce OR's 80 \u2192 50).

Recent realized demands (Periods 17\u201323 = 53, 30, 50, 86, 66, 37, 20) average \u2248 49 units; this aligns with the previously noted regime shift to roughly half the early-era demand. OR recommended 48 units, which is essentially a full-period target for mean demand, but placing OR's full recommendation would push ending inventory much higher than needed and incur holding cost equal to profit per unit per period. Since Profit = $1/unit and Holding = $1/unit/period, excess inventory directly reduces net reward if it is not sold promptly. Strategy and final quantity: Target Period 24 expected demand \u2248 49 units. With 38 on-hand, we only need about 11 more to meet that expected demand; I add a small safety margin of 1 unit to be conservative against variability. Thus I order 12 units.

Recent realized demands (P17\u2013P24) = [53, 30, 50, 86, 66, 37, 20, 36], average = 47.25 units. This aligns with the previously recorded carry-over insight that demand shifted down beginning Period 17 (recent avg ~44.3 noted earlier). Given profit = $1 and holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 0.5, so we should target the median/mean demand without extra safety stock. Holding cost equals profit, so over-ordering is costly. \n\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare to OR: OR recommends 70 units (uses longer historical data and promised lead time). OR's cap and base-stock logic produced a larger order, but it ignores the confirmed lower-demand regime and current zero lead-time reality. Following OR would likely create excess holding cost.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final order calculation and strategy: Use recent-period mean demand \u224847.25 as the target for this period. Required order = max(0, expected_demand \u2212 on_hand) = max(0, 47.25 \u2212 14) \u2248 33 units. I round to 33 (integer units).

OR blends older high-demand periods into its estimate, producing a higher target.

That argues for ordering to meet expected near-term demand, not to build extra safety stock.\nDecision math and final action:\n- Target coverage = expected Period 30 demand \u2248 50 units (based on recent average \u224850). With current on-hand = 22, order = 50 \u2212 22 = 28. To be slightly conservative for variability, I round up to 30 units so we have capacity to satisfy small upside without creating much excess holding cost.\n- This order arrives this period (L=0) and will be available to meet Period 30 demand; ending inventory will be minimal if demand is near expectation.\nWhy I deviated from OR (58 \u2192 30): OR uses older high-demand history and caps based on promised lead time; the environment shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 17 and lead time is 0, so OR's higher recommendation would create unnecessary holding cost. Therefore I scale OR down to roughly match recent realized demand.\nRisks and contingency: If demand unexpectedly spikes above ~52, we may stockout this period (lost sales), but stocking extra units is expensive due to holding cost equal to profit; this tradeoff favors a lean order. Monitor next periods for any upward shift and update accordingly.\n",

With L=0, orders placed now arrive within the same period and can satisfy current-period demand.\n- Inventory position: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. No pipeline to cover current demand, so any order placed will determine sales this period.\n- Demand analysis: Historical samples show a clear sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 17 (already recorded). Compute recent 10-period demand (P21\u2013P30): {66,37,20,36,51,52,58,48,55,62} sum=485, mean = 48.5 units/period. This aligns with the previously noted lower regime (Period17\u201319 avg=44.3). The long-run early-period mean (~109) is no longer representative.\n- OR recommendation: OR suggests 79 units (uses all history and promised lead time). OR's policy uses q = profit/(profit+holding) = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z*=0, so base_stock \u2248 estimated mean demand (but OR used the older higher mean across all history, producing 79). OR also caps orders which resulted in 79.\n- Decision logic: Given L=0 and current-period demand mean \u224848.5, ordering up to the recent mean minimizes both stockouts and holding cost because profit and holding cost are equal (no incentive to hold extra safety stock). There's no evidence of an imminent demand spike (no calendar events provided), and recent 10-period demand is stable around ~48\u201352 except some variation. Holding cost = $1/unit/period punishes overstock.\n- Final action: Order 49 units. Rationale for number: it is essentially the recent observed mean (48.5 rounded up to 49) to match expected demand this period while avoiding unnecessary holding cost. This reduces OR's recommended 79 by 30 units (\u2248\u221238%), reflecting the sustained lower-demand regime and zero lead time which lets us match orders tightly to expected single-period demand.\n- Risk/notes: If demand reverts upward suddenly, we may stockout this period; however the confirmed lower regime (since Period 17) and recent 10-period mean argue for conservative ordering.

With L=0 the decision must cover (L+1)=1 period of demand (current period's demand occurs after decision but arrivals this period will replenish before demand).\n\nDemand assessment: The long-run history shows a clear drop in demand starting around Period 17 (carry-over insight: recent avg P17\u2013P19 = 44.3 vs earlier \u2248109). Recent realized demands (P27\u2013P31 = 58, 48, 55, 62, 30) average \u224850.6; the very recent three periods (P29\u2013P31 = 55, 62, 30) average = 49.0.

OR also capped orders which produced 59.\n\nDecision logic: With L=0 and target stock = single-period mean \u224851, we need target_on_hand_after_arrival \u224851. Current on-hand + expected arrival (arrival will be this period) should equal target. Since in-transit = 0 and arrivals happen this period, ordering now will arrive and increase on-hand before demand. Order_qty = max(0, target - (on-hand + in-transit)) \u2248 51 - 19 = 32.\n\nRisk tradeoffs: Ordering 32 brings available inventory to \u224851 to meet expected demand this period with zero safety stock (q=0.5 is optimal given symmetric costs). I avoid OR's larger order (59) because demand has shifted lower since Period 17 and holding cost equals profit\u2014excess inventory immediately reduces objective. If upcoming periods show a rebound, we can respond quickly because lead time = 0.\n\nFinal strategy: Place order = 32 units (arrives this period).

Given recent 5-period mean \u224846 and 3-period mean \u224839, I choose a conservative order of 45 units to cover expected demand while avoiding unnecessary holding cost.

Recent realized demands (Periods 33\u201337) = [63, 18, 60, 34, 69] with average \u2248 48.8 units; this aligns with the previously recorded low-regime average (~44.3) rather than the earlier high mean (~109).

Rationale: with lead time = 0 the order covers this period's demand immediately; choosing ~50 units matches recent observed average demand (~48.8), avoids building inventory that incurs a high holding cost equal to profit, and corrects OR's upward bias from older high-demand data. This reduces expected overstock while providing likely enough units to meet demand in the current low-demand regime.

This confirms actual lead time = 0 periods and matches the carry-over insight (no lag or lost shipments currently).\n\nInventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so any sales this period must be satisfied from a same-period arrival (possible because lead time = 0). Recent demand has been variable but clearly below the high early-period levels. Look at the most recent five demand observations (Periods 34\u201338): 18, 60, 34, 69, 55 \u2192 mean = 47.2 units. The last three periods (36\u201338) average \u224852.7 units. Given the documented regime shift downward since Period 17, the recent sample mean (~47\u201353) is a better anchor than long-run history.\n\nOR recommendation review: OR recommends 73 units. OR uses the promised lead time and full historical data and applies a cap that may push orders upward. However profit and holding cost are equal (profit=$1, holding=$1) so the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, meaning no safety stock is optimal under a stable stationary model. Because lead time = 0, we don't need extra pipeline cover; ordering roughly one-period expected demand is appropriate.\n\nFinal strategy: I will order 50 units (rounded slightly above the 5-period mean of 47.2) to meet expected demand while avoiding unnecessary holding cost. This modest buffer (~+6% vs 47.2, and slightly below the OR's 73) hedges against recent variability (periods with 60 and 69) but keeps ending inventory exposure low given high holding cost. If we see three or more consecutive periods of demand above ~60 going forward, I'll escalate orders; conversely if demand falls further I'll reduce orders to match the new mean.\n\nAction mechanics note: With lead time 0, this order will arrive during Period 39 after my decision and will be available to satisfy Period 39 demand (and will be visible in Period 39 conclude read in Period 40).",

This recent five-period mean is the best indicator of current demand regime (demand has recovered from the deep drop around Periods 17\u201319 and stabilized in the high-40s-to-60s range). Profit = $1, Holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so the base-stock target equals the one-period mean (~59).

I am not increasing above OR since no strong signal of upcoming spike; I am not reducing further because stockouts would forgo $1 profit per unit with equal holding cost (q=0.5 implies balancing at the mean).\n\nRisks & mitigation: If demand suddenly spikes above recent mean (e.g., >80), we may understock; but historical volatility in the last 5\u201310 periods suggests mean ~59 with occasional higher draws (69).

Recent demands (Periods 40\u201344) = [65, 44, 50, 26, 42]. Mean of these five = 45.4 units. A one-period demand forecast (L+1 = 1) \u2248 45 units.

We already have 8 on hand. Order = target_demand \u2212 on_hand = 45 \u2212 8 = 37. To be slightly conservative given some recent demand variability (\u03c3 in recent window), I round up to 40 units. This balances avoiding lost sales (expected demand ~45) and avoiding expensive holding costs (holding = profit). If demand unexpectedly spikes, we will see arrivals immediately (lead time 0) in the same period and can adjust next period \u2014 but current ordering should minimize holding cost exposure.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk/comments: If you want to strictly follow OR to reduce chance of stockouts (at expense of holding costs), you could place 62. I choose 40 to reflect observed lower recent demand and equal unit holding/profit that penalizes overstocking.\n",

Therefore orders placed now will arrive during this same period and can meet Period 46 demand. No lost shipments are evident.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 6, In-transit = 0. With L=0 the relevant pipeline for OR is on-hand+in-transit = 6.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: Recent realized demands are much lower than the early-period regime. Last 5 periods (P41\u2013P45) demands = [44, 50, 26, 42, 42], mean \u2248 40.8. Earlier carry-over noted a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 17 (recent avg \u224844.3 vs earlier \u2248109). Current recent mean ~41 is consistent with that lower regime. Given profit = $1 and holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 1/(1+1) = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so the risk-neutral base stock equals the expected demand over (1+L) periods (here just a single period mean).\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Compare to OR recommendation: OR recommends 63 units (it uses historical samples and a cap that increases orders when pipeline is low). OR tends to over-order here because it incorporates variance-based caps and older high-demand samples. Because lead time is confirmed 0 and recent demand mean is ~41, ordering up to OR's 63 would create unnecessary holding cost with no extra profit (profit and holding are equal).\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final calculation: Base_stock \u2248 expected single-period demand \u2248 41. Pipeline inventory = 6. order_raw = base_stock - pipeline = 41 - 6 = 35. With lead time = 0, that order will arrive this period and meet demand. This balances avoiding stockouts (expected demand \u224841) and minimizing holding cost given equal profit & holding. I therefore place an order of 35 units.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk notes: If demand spikes unexpectedly (reversion to earlier high regime), this order may lead to stockouts; however historical and recent data strongly indicate the lower-demand regime.

Current visible state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order placed now will arrive in Period 49 before demand is realized.\nDemand assessment: Historical series shows a sustained lower-demand regime flagged at Period 20 (recent avg P17\u2013P19=44.3 vs earlier \u2248109). More recent demands (P45\u2013P48) = [42, 38, 60, 64]; the last three-period average (P46\u2013P48) = 54 units. There is variability but no new multi-period regime shift beyond what is already recorded.\nCost structure: Profit = $1/unit sold; Holding cost = $1/unit/period. With equal profit and holding cost, leftover ending inventory produces no net gain (each unsold unit costs as much to hold as it would have earned), so we should avoid systematic overordering and aim to match expected demand closely.\nOR recommendation: OR suggests 68 units (uses long-run history and promised lead time). Because lead time=0 and the demand regime is lower than early-history used by OR, following OR would likely create excess ending inventory and incur holding cost equal to the profit.\nDecision logic and final quantity: Order to match expected period demand to minimize leftover inventory. I use the recent 3-period average (P46\u2013P48 \u224854) as the best short-term predictor given no new sustained signal. With lead time 0 the order covers exactly this period's demand.

There are no overdue or lost shipments to account for.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand outlook: OR uses long-run history and promised lead time; with profit = holding cost the OR's critical fractile is 0.5 (z* = 0) so its base-stock equals the mean single-period demand. I prefer a short-run recent-mean forecast because demand has shown a lower, variable regime since Period 17 and recent periods are most relevant. Using the last 5 periods (P45\u2013P49) demands = [42, 38, 60, 64, 41], mean \u2248 49 units. This aligns with several recent single-period demands clustered around 40\u201364.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory target & order decision: With lead time 0 we need order + on-hand to cover one period's expected demand. Target on-hand \u2248 recent mean \u2248 49 units. Current on-hand 13 \u2192 order = 49 \u2212 13 = 36 units. This is slightly below the OR recommendation of 55 units because OR smooths to a higher cap based on longer history and a 95% service cap; given equal profit/holding cost (no asymmetric penalty for stockouts) and observed lower recent demand, I prefer to avoid excess holding cost by targeting the recent mean rather than OR's higher cap.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Risk tradeoffs & monitoring: Ordering 36 leaves some chance of stockout if demand spikes (e.g., 60+), but it minimizes expected holding cost given profit = holding. Because lead time is 0, if next period's demand deviates consistently I'll adapt immediately.
