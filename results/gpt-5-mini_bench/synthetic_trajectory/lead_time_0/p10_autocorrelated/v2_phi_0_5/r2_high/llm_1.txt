No evidence of a sustained regime shift.\nc) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but we have no concluded arrivals yet to confirm actual lead time; cannot infer a change. Because actual lead time is unknown, there is risk orders may not arrive same period; however we must act on available information.\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. We need inventory to meet expected near-term demand; holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($19/unit), so moderate overstock is less costly than lost sales.\ne) Final order logic: Target to satisfy expected Period_1 demand (75 units) to capture profit while avoiding unnecessary holding.

Game history: Period_1 experienced true demand=90 with a stockout (sold 75, ending 0). This suggests demand is likely higher than Period_1 sales and consistent with the higher historical sample for Period_2. I therefore expect demand in Period_2 around ~138 units.\nc) Lead time / missing orders: The Period_1 conclude shows an order placed in Period_1 arrived in Period_1 and lead_time was 0 periods. That indicates same-period delivery is possible for now.\nd) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0 at the decision moment. With lead_time=0, an order placed now will arrive during Period_2 and can satisfy Period_2 demand.\ne) Final order logic: Profit per unit is high ($19) versus holding cost low ($1/period), so the cost of understocking (lost profit) is much larger than modest holding cost.

Longer-run history is volatile (many periods with demand ~60-140 earlier), but the most recent 5 periods show a much lower short-term average driven by two zero-demand periods (P42,P43).

Demand analysis: recent sold history (Periods 42\u201346) = [0, 0, 41, 79, 80]. The 127 demand in Period 45 was partially lost due to stockout (sold 79), so true demand can spike above recent sales.

Lead time & pipeline: carry-over already confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals same period). Current inventory: on-hand = 50, in-transit = 0. Decision logic: because orders arrive same period, any order placed now can meet Period 47 demand. Given high margin and low holding cost, we should cover a reasonable forecast that captures likely demand spikes while avoiding excessive end-of-horizon holding. A target demand estimate of ~80 units for the coming period balances recent spikes and typical sales; with 50 on hand, ordering 30 brings available inventory to \u224880 to satisfy expected demand and reduce stockout risk.
