Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrival history to infer lead-time. Promised lead time is 0 and there is no evidence to deviate. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [80,120,120,93,177]; with no changepoint detected (too little history for a sustained shift) I use default estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample demand statistics, avoids overfitting to early noise, and instructs the OR engine to set a base-stock appropriate for average demand while letting it apply the profit/holding tradeoff. With on-hand + pipeline = 0, the backend will order to bring pipeline up toward the computed base-stock.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 context: last conclude (Period_1) shows the Period_1 order (180) arrived in Period_1 and demand sold=106, leaving on-hand=74 and in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (provided) are [80,120,120,93,177]; recent realized demand in Period_1 was 106. The observed lead time from concluded message is 0 periods (ordered P1 arrived P1), so I use the measured lead-time signal. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and the observed arrival behavior, I set L using the calculated average of observed lead times. For demand forecasting I use the default rules so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (using full sample mean/variance) against holding cost given on-hand=74 and no in-transit: we avoid over-ordering while letting the OR engine determine the appropriate base-stock given profit=19 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: order placed Period 1 arrived Period 1)

Daily Reward (R_t): $2048.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 start: on-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times show orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 arrived same period (lead_time=0 confirmed). Recent on-hand plus no pipeline means we must cover current-period demand only (promised L=0). Demand history (environment samples) will be used by the backend to compute base stock; I will use defaults: keep L as promised (default) because observed lead time = 0 is confirmed; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This preserves the backend's statistical forecast while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise; with profit >> holding cost, the engine's service-level-calibrated base stock will lean toward higher fill rates but the default sigma allows cap limiting to restrain excessive orders. No evidence of lost shipments or regime change that warrants deviation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1974.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision: confirmed fast fulfillment (lead time has been 0 in concluded P1\u2013P3). On-hand=59, in-transit=0, recent realized demand (concluded periods) = [106,111,107] which is lower than the longer-sample mean (118) because Period_5's 177 appears as an isolated spike in the provided sample set. No overdue or missing shipments are present. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current lower-demand regime (evidence: three consecutive concluded periods with demand ~106\u2013111). This reduces excess holding while preserving high service (profit >> holding cost, so we still keep safety via the OR backend's z* calculation). Using recent demand avoids overshooting orders driven by the isolated high sample (177) and helps limit holding cost given low holding cost but still large profit per unit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2147.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: confirmed historical lead time = 0 (Period 1-4 concludes show arrivals same-period). Recent realized demands: [80, 120, 120, 93, 177], mean \u2248118. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we currently have no stock to meet Period 5 demand. Product economics: profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 high service-level target (q\u22480.95). Given consistent same-period arrivals (no evidence of lost or delayed shipments) I use the default lead time (promised L=0) and default demand estimates using all available samples so the OR backend applies the full-sample mean and std across the (1+L) review+lead period. This yields a base-stock that prioritizes service (appropriate given high profit per unit) while the backend\u2019s capped order will guard against extreme over-ordering. If future concludes show multi-period delays or lost shipments, I will switch to an explicit/recent estimate of L and increase safety-stock accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1897.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 context: recent concluded history (Periods 1-5) shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and no in-transit inventory. Demand samples for Periods 1-5 are [80,120,120,93,177] with mean=118. On-hand = 60, in-transit = 0; there are no overdue shipments to reconcile. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (L = default) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0-period actual lead time. I choose mu_hat = default to let the backend compute (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples = 1*118, reflecting the full-sample demand estimate without overreacting to the high Period_5 spike. I choose sigma_hat = default so the backend uses the full-sample volatility (\u221a(1+L)*std_all_samples). These default choices are conservative: they leverage the stable lead-time evidence and the full-sample demand stats to balance service level (profit $19) against holding cost ($1) without overfitting to the single high demand period.

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 decision. Recent confirmed lead time = 0 (previous concludes show arrivals same period). On-hand = 118, in-transit = 0, so immediate available stock is healthy versus historical demand (historical sample mean = 118 units/period). No overdue or lost shipments evident. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) because multiple concluded periods confirm same-period arrivals. For demand I choose mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) = 1\xd7118, reflecting the stable long-run average across the five historical samples. For sigma_hat I choose default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), capturing historical variability. These choices keep the base-stock tied to the observed mean demand and acknowledged low lead time, avoiding excess safety stock given low holding cost (holding $1 vs profit $19), while allowing the OR engine to set service level via its profit/(profit+holding) tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1495.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: on-hand=82, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed previously). Recent demand (Periods 3-7) = [107, 138, 103, 42, 83] \u2014 mean \u224894.6, high variability driven by one low period (P6). I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (captures recent variability and the recent lower average vs. older samples). sigma_hat is also recent_N (N=5) so the backend computes safety stock based on recent volatility rather than older data that may be stale. This choice balances service (by sizing reorder to recent mean + safety) while avoiding excessive holding cost from using a long-term higher mean. With on-hand=82 and no pipeline, the OR engine using these inputs will target inventory to cover roughly one period of the recent mean plus safety.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1727.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 start: on-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 each concluded period), so promised lead time appears reliable. Recent demand has moderated compared with the earlier snapshot: last 5 concluded-period demands (Periods 4-8) = [138,103,42,83,94] (mean \u224892), which better reflects the most recent regime than the older full-sample mean. Given high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), the OR engine should target a relatively high fill-rate but avoid excessive inventory by forecasting using the recent regime. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and set demand parameters using recent_N=5 to capture the latest demand mean and volatility; this balances service level (high profit favors higher base_stock) with holding cost (keeps orders aligned to recent lower average demand). No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift in concluded history, so no explicit lead-time adjustment is needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1790.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 context: on-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all show 0 periods (Period1\u20139 arrivals matched same-period orders), so no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [80,120,120,93,177], mean=118 units/period, std\u224833.3. Promised lead time is 0 and actual lead time has been consistently 0, so I use default lead time (promised). I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample set; with L=0 this yields mu_hat \u2248118 and sigma_hat \u224833.3 internally. This balances service level (using full-sample demand mean and variability) against holding costs given current moderate on-hand inventory; because on-hand (53) + in-transit (0) is well below the full-period expected demand, the OR engine will replenish toward the base-stock implied by profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_11. Recent observed concluded lead times are all 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period) so I set L to be calculated from observations. On-hand = 103, in-transit = 0; there are no overdue/lost shipments visible. Demand shows a sustained downward shift beginning Period_6: Periods 1\u20135 average demand \u2248113, Periods 6\u201310 average \u224873.8. To adapt the base-stock to the new lower regime while still covering the (1+L) review+lead window, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes mean and volatility from the most recent 5 periods (Periods 6\u201310). This reduces excess holding while preserving service given current lower demand. Using calculate for L lets the backend confirm lead time=0 from concluded history. These choices balance high profit (profit >> holding cost) by avoiding unnecessary overstock from older high-demand periods while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg demand dropped from 113 (Periods 1\u20135) to 73.8 (Periods 6\u201310), a -34.7% sustained decrease

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history (orders placed each period arrived same period), so using promised lead time is appropriate. On-hand = 18, in-transit = 0; with lead time 0 we must cover current-period demand after decision, so we set mu_hat to reflect the recent lower-demand regime. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 6\u201311) because the changepoint at Period_6 produced a sustained lower mean; N=6 equals the detected recent regime length and is within the allowed bounds. Sigma is set using recent_N N=6 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices bias orders toward the lower recent demand (reducing holding cost) while still providing safety against observed variability in the last 6 periods.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 13. Historical conclude messages show all observed arrivals for chips(Regular) arrived same-period (lead_time = 0) consistently through Period 12. Recent demand samples (most recent five concluded periods, Periods 8\u201312: 94, 97, 53, 97, 84) show a lower, stable regime compared with early periods; the carry-over insight already recorded a sustained drop starting at Period 6. On-hand = 34, in-transit = 0, so we must ensure order + pipeline covers (1+L) periods of demand. Choices: L set to "calculate" so backend confirms observed lead time average (reflecting the consistent 0-period arrivals). For demand I choose recent_N (N=5) to anchor the base-stock to the most recent regime mean (captures current lower demand pattern while smoothing short-term variability). Sigma set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than older higher-variance samples. These parameters bias the OR engine toward a lower target inventory (reducing holding cost) while preserving service by sizing safety stock from recent variability. This directly addresses missing/late shipment risks by using observed lead time (calculate) and recent demand behavior for sizing mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_14. Context: on-hand=37, in-transit=0. Profit/Holding => high service target (q\u22480.95). Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 for all observed orders (Periods 1\u201313), and prior carry-over recorded a sustained demand regime drop beginning Period 6. Evidence: recent realized demands (Periods 6\u201313) = [42,83,94,97,53,97,84,79], recent-regime mean \u224878.6 units. Given the confirmed regime shift (lower mean since Period 6) I use a recent-regime forecast rather than the long-run mean so the OR backend targets an appropriate base stock. Choices: L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because all concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time; mu_hat set via recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 6\u201313 average \u224878.6, so one-period requirement \u224878.6); sigma_hat set via recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility for safety stock. This balances the high profit-driven service level (z*\u22481.645) against holding cost by using the recent, lower-demand regime so we avoid overstock while keeping a high fill rate. Also note on-hand (37) is materially below the expected (\u224878.6) one-period demand so the backend will replenish toward the base stock.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 start. History shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 confirmed repeatedly) and a sustained demand regime drop that began at Period 6 (noted in carry-over). On-hand = 25, in-transit = 0; with promised L=0 and observed steady 0 lead time, we keep L at default. Recent demand (Periods 6\u201314) is the relevant regime; to capture the current lower mean and recent volatility I use recent_N on the last 9 periods (Period 6\u201314) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 9 samples and sqrt(1+L)*std of last 9 samples. This biases orders toward the recent lower-demand regime, reducing holding cost while maintaining service. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat helps the OR engine compute a base stock aligned to the confirmed lower-demand regime and observed low lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1448.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 context: historical concluded demands (Periods 1\u201315) show a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 6; carry-over already recorded that drop. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0, matching the promised lead time. Current inventory: on-hand=34, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand (Periods 11\u201315 = 97,84,79,88,78) averages 85.2 units. With promised lead time 0, the OR backend expects mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_demand across the review+lead period. I choose L="default" (use promised lead time 0) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm lead time 0. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean of the last 5 samples \u2248 85.2. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture recent demand volatility rather than older, higher-variance samples. Rationale for these choices: they align the base-stock target to the confirmed lower demand while preserving service-level calculation; using recent data reduces over-ordering driven by earlier high-demand periods. Given on-hand=34 and expected period demand \u224885, the policy will top up toward the recent-demand-informed base stock while the cap limits extreme orders, balancing profit per unit ($19) against holding cost ($1) per unit per period.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 observed repeatedly), and a sustained demand regime drop was already recorded at Period 11. Recent demands (Periods 1\u201316 conclude) remain consistent with that lower regime. Given profit $19 vs holding $1 (high target service level q\u22480.95), I keep the lead time at the promised value and let the OR backend compute the base-stock using all available demand samples so it captures the full historical mean/variance under the confirmed lead time. Using defaults (L=default, mu_hat=default, sigma_hat=default) delegates calculation to the OR engine which will produce a high service-level z* while capping orders to limit overstock risk. This balances the high profit per unit (favoring service) against holding cost (favoring restraint) and addresses the current zero on-hand/in-transit by prompting an order up to the computed base-stock.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: profit = $19, holding = $1. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201317) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand history shows a sustained regime shift starting at Period 6 (carry-over noted): average demand dropped materially and has remained lower since. On-hand = 16, in-transit = 0; with lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during this same period's arrival resolution and be visible in the next conclude. To be conservative and align the OR base-stock to the lower recent-demand regime, I forecast demand using the recent regime (Periods 6 onward). I choose L = default so the backend uses the promised lead time (0), which is repeatedly confirmed by concludes. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=12 (periods 6\u201317 form a sustained lower-demand regime; regime_length=12 \u2192 N=12) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 12 samples, anchoring orders to the reduced demand level. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=12 to reflect recent volatility rather than older higher-demand variability. These choices reduce over-ordering risk (lower holding cost) while preserving service by matching the sustained lower-demand regime and confirmed zero lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1488.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. On-hand = 51, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 0 (many periods confirm same-period arrival), so I keep L at the promised/default (0). Demand has exhibited a downward regime change around Period 6 (noted previously) but recent periods (14\u201318) show a rebound/volatility with higher values including two spikes (Periods 16\u201317). To balance service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) I bias the forecast toward recent demand to react to the latest volatility while avoiding excessive long-term inventory. Therefore I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent mean demand across the review+lead period, and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This yields an order policy that raises target stock to meet recent higher demand spikes but keeps safety stock responsive to current variance, helping the OR backend trade off the high per-unit profit against holding cost and the observed absence of in-transit units.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 context: on-hand = 43, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time = 0 in every conclude message (Periods 1\u201319), and no recent lost shipments. Demand history (Periods 1\u201319) has overall mean ~95.3 units/period with some variation and a prior documented downshift around Period 6\u201310 that was recorded earlier. Given confirmed same-period arrivals, I use the promised lead time (default L=0). I select mu_hat and sigma_hat using the backend defaults so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean and stddev ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to compute base-stock and cap; this balances service (profit/$19 high) against holding cost ($1) by letting the OR engine internally set the safety stock via q = profit/(profit+holding). No evidence of new sustained regime change since the previously recorded shift, so default (full-history) estimates are appropriate. With on-hand=43 and no pipeline, these parameters will prompt the OR policy to replenish toward the base-stock driven by realized mean demand and the profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2793.00

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 start. Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (concluded lead_time=0 in many periods), and current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no overdue shipments are hiding. Demand has been variable recently with a notable high spike in Period 20 (d=186) after several mid-range periods (Periods 16\u201319: 132,132,81,105). To be responsive to this recent regime (including the Period 20 spike) I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm lead_time=0. For demand I use a recent_N=5 window (Periods 16\u201320) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demands, capturing the recent uplift and volatility; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent variability. This raises the target base-stock to cover the current elevated short-term demand while keeping holding exposure limited (holding cost is low relative to profit). The choice balances service (cover the Period 20 spike risk) against holding cost by using only the very recent data rather than the older lower-demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3148.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. On-hand = 25, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed have arrived same period across all concluded messages). Demand has risen materially starting Period 17: recent demands (Periods 17\u201321 = 132, 81, 105, 186, 167) average 134.2, substantially above the prior mid-regime average (~84.3 for Periods 6\u201316). I therefore: (1) keep L at the promised/default (0) since concluded history confirms 0 lead time; (2) set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to target the new higher-demand regime (the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples so the forecast reflects the elevated demand); (3) set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the variability estimate reflects the recent volatility including the large spike in Period 20. These choices keep orders responsive to the confirmed same-period lead time and raise the target base-stock to reduce stockouts in the new high-demand regime while the sigma update helps the OR backend size safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg demand increased from ~84.3 (Periods 6\u201316) to 134.2 (Periods 17\u201321), a +59.9 (\u2248+71%) sustained increase

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 context: on-hand=86, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201322) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period), so I will use the promised/default lead time. Recent carry-over insights document a demand regime shift up at Period 17; no new sustained changepoint detected in the last period. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) the OR backend should target a high service level (q\u22480.95). I choose default methods so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) which uses full historical demand to reflect the sustained higher regime since Period 17. Using defaults keeps parameters aligned with confirmed lead time=0 and allows the OR engine to produce a high base-stock to avoid stockouts while the holding cost penalty remains small.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 context: all concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 repeatedly (orders placed each period arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 19\u201323 = 105,186,167,120,133) is elevated relative to earlier regimes and the carry-over insight already recorded a sustained regime shift starting at Period 17. Current inventory: on-hand=29, in-transit=0, so we are low and must replenish to meet same-period demand. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0 lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (gives (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples \u2248 142 units demand over the review+lead period). Sigma_hat kept as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices raise the base stock to reflect the elevated recent demand while using default sigma to avoid overfitting variance from a very small window. This balances the high service-level implied by profit/(profit+holding)=0.95 against holding cost by focusing the mean forecast on the most recent regime while relying on population volatility for the safety-stock calculation.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 context: demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime since Period 17 (carry-over notes record this). Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0, so use default lead time. Current inventory: on-hand=86, in-transit=0, so no arrivals expected this period. Given the confirmed regime increase beginning Period 17, I focus forecasting on the most recent demand samples (Periods 17\u201324) rather than all historical data. I choose recent_N with N=8 (Periods 17\u201324) for mu_hat to capture the elevated mean (~134 units) and for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility; this keeps target base-stock aligned to current demand and avoids overreacting to older low-demand periods (Periods 6\u201316). Using recent statistics with L=default (0) balances higher service level to avoid stockouts in the new higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding cost by not inflating safety stock using older high-variance history. Also note no in-transit units and lead time 0 means orders placed now will arrive in the same period demand occurs, so parameters directly control same-period replenishment.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 decision. Recent demand has settled into the higher regime noted in carry-over (Period 17+). Last 5 realized demands (Periods 21\u201325) = [167,120,133,112,147], mean = 135.8 units. On-hand = 38, in-transit = 0, and there are no overdue or missing arrivals to reconcile. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 0, so I use the default lead time to match supplier behavior. To keep the OR engine responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost, I use a recent_N mean (N=5) for mu_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean over the most-relevant samples (captures the +71% lift observed starting Period 17). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent volatility rather than older low-demand periods. This combination raises target base stock to service the higher demand observed while letting the OR cap limit extreme over-ordering, balancing high profit per unit (profit $19 vs holding $1) against inventory carrying costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2228.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: on-hand=52, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical concludes consistently show lead_time=0 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand regime (Periods 17\u201326) is elevated vs earlier history: recent 10-period mean \u2248130.3 units/period (samples: P17\u2013P26 = 132,81,105,186,167,120,133,112,147,120). Given immediate same-period arrivals (L=0), the OR engine expects mu_hat to cover (1+L)\xd7demand across review+lead; I therefore use a recent_N forecast over the last 10 periods to capture the current higher-demand regime while avoiding dilution by older low-demand periods. I also use recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility (including the large 186 spike). Using recent_N (N=10) steers the backend toward a higher base stock appropriate for current demand, while sigma estimated from the same window increases safety stock for the observed variability. This balances service level (high profit $19 vs $1 holding cost favors fill) against carrying cost given on-hand=52 and no pipeline; since lead time is 0, orders placed will arrive this period, so targeting the recent-demand-based base stock will help avoid stockouts during this elevated regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1599.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent demand remains in the higher regime that was confirmed at Period 22 (sustained increase starting Period 17). On-hand = 92, in-transit = 0, promised lead time = 0 and historically all concluded orders show actual lead time = 0, so no adjustment to L. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand forecast I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 17\u201327) because that shift (+~71%) is sustained; I use recent_N with N=11 (the length of the current regime from Period 17 through Period 27) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 11 samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the last 11 samples. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the higher demand regime while the sigma estimate from the same recent window captures current volatility. With L=0 the OR backend will target service level driven by profit/(profit+holding) and my recent-window demand inputs reduce the risk of systematic understocking while avoiding excessive holding cost from using older, lower-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2121.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 context: on-hand=64, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 0 (many concluded messages: orders placed each period arrived same period), and carry-over already recorded lead time=0. Recent demand (Periods 24\u201328 = 112,147,120,89,115) has mean \u2248116.6 and shows the post-Period-17 higher-demand regime continues (carry-over recorded). There are no overdue or lost shipments to reconcile this period (in-transit=0). Given confirmed same-period delivery (L=0) and a clear sustained higher-demand regime since Period 17, I use a short recent-window forecast so the OR backend's base-stock reflects current demand rather than older low-demand samples. Choices: L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with concluded history; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to set (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demands \u2248116.6 which aligns supply to current demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These parameters keep target inventory aligned with the current higher-demand regime, reducing stockouts while avoiding excessive holding cost given holding=$1/unit and high profit=$19/unit (the backend will compute service-level z from profit/(profit+holding)).

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 context: on-hand=75, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many periods confirmed). Carry-over indicates a sustained demand regime shift up at Period 17 (higher demand since). Recent demand (Periods 17\u201329) is materially higher than earlier regime, so I target the recent high-demand regime for forecasting. Choice of L: 'default' (promised lead time = 0) because every concluded period shows arrivals same-period, so no evidence to increase lead time. Choice of mu_hat: 'recent_N' with N=13 to cover Periods 17\u201329 (the confirmed higher-demand regime). This sets (1+L)*mean over the recent high-demand regime so base stock reflects the new elevated demand. Choice of sigma_hat: 'recent_N' with N=13 to capture recent volatility in the same regime. Rationale vs. inventory: with profit >> holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 target service level ~95%), using the recent high-demand mean and corresponding volatility will raise target base-stock to avoid stockouts during this sustained high-demand period while sigma reflects recent variability to avoid excessive overstock. No in-transit units are expected, so orders will need to bring pipeline up to the (1+L)-period coverage implied by the OR engine using these estimates.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 context: on-hand=70, in-transit=0. Profit per unit=$19, holding cost=$1. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201330) consistently show orders arriving same period they were placed (many 'lead_time was 0 periods'), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. No overdue or missing shipments observed. Demand history through Period 30 shows the previously recorded regime shifts; no new sustained changepoint since Period 22. Given confirmed 0 lead time and stable post-Period-22 higher demand regime, I use a calculated lead time to reflect observed data (should be 0) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine can compute base-stock = (1+L)*mean \xb1 safety based on profit/holding. This balances high service level (high profit per unit) against modest holding cost by letting the OR backend set the safety factor from profit/(profit+holding) while using overall sample statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 start: on-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201331) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period as order). Recent demand has been elevated compared to early periods, and the most recent five observed demands (Periods 27\u201331 = 89, 115, 76, 105, 103) have mean \u224897.6. Given the confirmed 0-period lead time, I use the promised/default lead time and focus the demand forecast on the most recent regime to avoid overstock from older lower-demand periods. Therefore: set L to default (promised 0); set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current demand level (1+L times mean of last 5 \u224897.6); set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This produces orders tuned to current demand while keeping safety stock reasonable given low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19), balancing service and holding costs.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 context: on-hand=12, in-transit=0, no outstanding arrivals visible. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1\u201332) are consistently 0, so actual lead time is well supported as 0. Demand regime: a sustained higher-demand regime began at Period 17 (carry-over insight recorded previously) and persists through the most recent periods (demands in Periods 17\u201332 remain elevated and variable around ~100+). Given the low on-hand (12) and zero pipeline, I need the OR backend to target the current higher-demand regime when computing the base stock. Decisions: set L by calculation from observed lead times (backend will confirm average observed lead time = 0). For demand (mu_hat) use recent_N with N=16 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime since Period 17 (use the last 16 concluded periods, Periods 17\u201332). For volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=16 to reflect recent variability. These choices avoid diluting the forecast with older low-demand data (Periods 1\u201316) while relying on a sustained 16-period higher-demand regime; they prompt the OR engine to raise target base stock to reduce stockout risk given current near-zero pipeline, while the sigma estimate helps size safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 context: on-hand=82, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201333) consistently show actual lead_time=0 (orders arriving same period), so using default lead time is justified. Carry-over history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (higher demand since P17), so I use recent_N methods that focus the forecast on the post-change regime. I choose N=17 for recent_N (Periods 17\u201333) because the regime length is 17 periods; this meets the rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3). Using recent_N for mu_hat captures the higher recent mean demand and keeps the base-stock sized for current demand levels; using recent_N for sigma_hat captures recent volatility so the OR backend sets safety stock appropriately. Default L keeps the promised lead time (0) which matches observed arrivals, minimizing unnecessary pipeline inflation. This balances service (avoid stockouts given higher recent demand) against holding cost by focusing forecasts on the confirmed higher-demand regime rather than older lower-demand data.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 start: on-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201334) consistently show orders arriving in the same period they were placed\u2014lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand has varied (notably regime shifts previously recorded in carry-over), but there is no new 3+ period sustained change since the last recorded insights. Profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) implies a very high service-level target (q \u2248 0.95). Given confirmed L=0 and no new sustained demand regime, I choose the defaults so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std: this leverages the full sample history to set a high base-stock (matching high q) while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise. Also, with on-hand=80 and no pipeline, the backend will order toward that high base-stock to protect service level while its cap limits extreme orders.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. On-hand=53, in-transit=0; no overdue or missing shipments in concluded history (all observed lead_times=0). Recent demand (Periods 31\u201335 = 103, 111, 86, 86, 104) averages ~98, lower than the peak regime around Periods 17\u201324. Given current on-hand is modest and holding cost is low ($1) versus profit high ($19), I favor a demand forecast based on the most recent 5 periods to capture the current regime while avoiding overstock. I therefore use promised lead time (default L=0). For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) so the backend sets base stock to (1+L)\xd7recent mean, matching current demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility for appropriate safety stock. This balances high service-level incentives (high profit) with modest holding cost by using recent data rather than the full-sample mean which includes older regimes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1663.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 context: on-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period), and carry-over already records lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand (Periods 32\u201336 = 111, 86, 86, 104, 89) shows a lower short-run mean (~95.2) than earlier high-demand regimes, so I bias the forecast to the most recent regime to avoid excess holding cost. Given high profit vs holding cost (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 target service ~95%), we still need good service but not oversized orders. Therefore: L use default (promised 0). mu_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the current lower-demand pattern while maintaining the backend's high service target.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201337) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (every concluded arrival was same-period), so I accept the promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 33\u201337 = 86,86,104,89,132) remains elevated relative to the very first 5-sample seed, but the game has already recorded sustained regime changes earlier (Period 11 and Period 22). I see no new 3+ period sustained changepoint since those carry-overs. Given confirmed lead time = 0 and no new sustained demand regime, I select default methods so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples it holds. This keeps the base-stock anchored to the long-run empirical mean while letting the backend compute the safety stock tradeoff using profit/holding cost. Using defaults also avoids overreacting to short volatile bursts in the last few periods when on-hand and pipeline are zero and arrivals will be visible immediately (lead time 0).

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 review. On-hand=58, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201338) consistently show arrived=ordered in the same period \u2192 actual lead time has been 0 throughout (confirmed earlier). Recent demand regime (Period 17 onward) is higher and sustained; to better reflect the current higher-demand regime I use a recent-N forecast that emphasizes the most recent 20 periods. This captures the post-Period-17 elevated demand while smoothing short-term noise. Using L=default (promised 0) is appropriate since all concluded arrivals show lead time 0. Choosing mu_hat recent_N (N=20) produces a (1+L)\xd7mean focused on the recent high-demand regime so the OR engine orders enough to avoid stockouts given same-period arrivals. Choosing sigma_hat recent_N (N=20) yields volatility estimated from the same recent window so safety stock reflects current variability. This balances the high profit ($19) \u2014 which favors service \u2014 against low holding cost ($1) by basing the base-stock on recent elevated mean and corresponding recent volatility. No in-transit stock implies any order placed this period must cover current-period demand (lead time 0) so the recent-based forecast reduces stockout risk without excessively inflating long-term holding costs.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed repeatedly; earliest Period 2 insight). Current inventory: on-hand=55, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 35\u201339) = [104, 89, 132, 98, 106], recent mean = 105.8 units/period and recent sample std \u2248 14.4. No new sustained demand regime or lead-time changepoint since the last carry-over insights, so do not record a new insight. I choose L='default' (use promised lead time 0) because all concluded arrivals show 0 lead time. To make the order target responsive to the recent demand level (and avoid excess inventory given holding cost $1 vs profit $19), I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 samples (~105.8). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility (std \u224814.4). This combination keeps the base-stock anchored to current realized demand and recent variability, balancing service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost and the observed lack of in-transit stock.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 context: on-hand = 69, in-transit = 0, promised lead time = 0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 0 across all observed periods, so I use 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time (expected 0). On-hand + pipeline (69) must cover (1+L) periods of demand because arrivals occur after decision; with L\u22480 we only need to cover ~1 period ahead. Recent demand since the last confirmed regime shift (Period 17) remains the best reflection of current demand; I therefore ask the backend to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 20 demand samples to capture current mean and volatility while smoothing short-term noise. Using recent_N (N=20) biases orders toward current demand levels and helps balance service (profit $19/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit) by reducing excessive inventory from older, lower-demand regimes. No overdue shipments are observed (in-transit=0 and all prior orders concluded), so no explicit lead-time extension is needed.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 start: on-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (many confirms including Period 1 arrival), so promised lead time remains valid. Recent demand (Periods 37\u201341 = 132, 98, 106, 64, 147) shows elevated volatility and a higher average versus earlier mid-run troughs, but this 5-period window is the most relevant for immediate stocking because arrivals are same-period. I therefore set L to default (promised 0). To keep service high given very low on-hand and no pipeline, I use a short recent window for demand forecast: mu_hat recent_N with N=5 captures the most recent mean demand (\u2248109.4 units) to target immediate refill. For variability I also use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect the increased recent volatility. These settings push the OR backend to order toward a base-stock sized to cover current short-term demand while the sigma estimate preserves safety stock against recent swings; this balances profit (high $19/unit) versus low holding cost ($1/unit) and the urgent need to replenish from near-zero on-hand.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 decision. Recent demand has been elevated since the previously recorded regime shift at Period 17 (carry-over: sustained increase to ~134/day); last several periods show very high demand (Periods 38\u201342: 98,106,64,147,160) with particularly large sales in P41\u2013P42 (147,160). On-hand inventory is critically low (3) and in-transit=0, so risk of immediate stockout is high. All concluded history (Periods 1\u201342) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrive same period), so I accept the promised lead time. To have the OR backend target current higher demand while avoiding excessive holding cost, I use recent_N estimation focused on the most recent 20-period regime (Periods 23\u201342), which captures the post-Period-17 elevated demand pattern while smoothing older low-demand history. L is set to default (promised 0, supported by concluded arrivals). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=20) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 samples, biasing order-up-to toward recent higher sales. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility and produce appropriate safety stock. This combination balances higher service level needed now (to avoid stockouts given on-hand=3) against holding cost by restricting attention to the current high-demand regime rather than the long-run mean.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44 decision. Current inventory: on-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show arrivals in the same period they were ordered (many 'lead_time was 0 periods' messages), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0; no overdue or missing shipments visible. Recent demand has been elevated and more variable (recent demands: 141,160,147,120,133,112,147,120,105,186,167,120,133,112,147,120,89,115,76,105,103,111,86,86,104,89,115,98,106,64,147,160,141) supporting a moderately high target inventory. Given product economics (profit $19 >> holding $1) we prefer a higher service level; therefore use the backend defaults so it computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples and sets z by profit/(profit+holding). Using defaults keeps our estimate robust to the full sample history and leverages confirmed lead time=0. This balances high service (high profit per unit) against modest holding cost without overfitting to recent noise. No on-hand arrivals expected this period (in-transit=0), so ordering should replenish to the computed base-stock to avoid stockouts.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 context: Profit = $19/unit, Holding = $1/unit/period. On-hand = 40, In-transit = 0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201344) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders from each period arrived same period). Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 17 (carry-over insight recorded earlier). Given high profit vs low holding cost, we should bias toward protecting service (higher base-stock) using recent demand patterns. I therefore keep L at default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms L=0. For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the most recent 20 periods of observed demand (this captures the sustained high-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand periods). Using recent 20-period statistics will raise the base-stock to meet current demand levels and the OR engine cap calculation, which balances service level and inventory risk, will constrain order sizes appropriately. This approach addresses the lack of in-transit inventory (0) and the high profit/low holding cost tradeoff by favoring service level while not being overly reactionary to single-period spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2328.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 context: recent demand has been elevated (Periods 41\u201345 demands = 147,160,141,118,124; recent mean \u2248138), and historical data shows the sustained regime shift already recorded (Period 22). All past orders have concluded with lead_time=0, so promised lead time is reliable. Current inventory: on-hand=28, in-transit=0 \u2014 well below recent per-period demand (~138). Profit/holding tradeoff: profit = $19, holding = $1 gives q = 19/20 = 0.95 (high service target), so the OR backend will set a high z. To reflect confirmed short lead time and to let the OR engine compute base stock from the full-sample demand stats (stable, with a previously recorded regime shift), I choose default methods so the backend uses (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps forecasting conservative (uses all available data) while relying on the backend's service-level calibration given the high profit per unit. Given low on-hand and zero pipeline, the engine will order up toward that computed base stock to restore service level while the low holding cost moderates carrying risk.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 47. All concluded arrivals through Period 46 show actual lead time = 0 (every order arrived same period). On-hand = 45, in-transit = 0. Profit per unit is high ($19) vs holding cost $1, implying a high service-level target (q \u2248 0.95). Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since around Period 17 (carry-over insight records this). Recent realized demand (last ~20 periods) has been consistently elevated relative to the initial five-sample history, so I trust the recent regime for forecasting rather than the earliest small-sample prior. Reconciliation: with on-hand 45 and no in-transit, we should set parameters to cover the current period plus lead time (L=0) using a demand forecast reflecting the recent high-demand regime while accounting for elevated service level due to high profit. Choices: L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0-period lead time. mu_hat set using recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent sustained higher-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean). sigma_hat set using recent_N with N=20 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This gives the OR engine a forecast that matches the current demand regime and supports the high service level implied by profit vs holding cost, while avoiding overweighting early low-sample observations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $911.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (actual lead time = 0 in all observed concludes). Demand has been in a higher regime since the previously recorded changepoint at Period 17 (sustained higher mean through recent periods). Given the long, sustained high-demand regime (Periods 17\u201347), I prioritize a recent-sample forecast to capture current elevated demand and variability. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0, well supported by concluded history). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the most recent ~20 periods of observed demand within the high regime (N capped at 20 per rules). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices push the OR backend toward a base-stock sized for the recent high-demand regime, balancing the high profit ($19) against modest holding cost ($1) by using recent demand statistics rather than long-run averages that would understate current demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1149.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision. History shows confirmed actual lead time = 0 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=0). Recent demand regime change was previously recorded (Period 17 onward) with a sustained higher mean. On-hand=86, in-transit=0 so we currently must cover this period's demand after decision. Given the sustained higher-demand regime since Period 17 and ample post-change samples, I use a recent-N forecast to reflect the current higher mean/volatility rather than the full-sample mean which mixes lower earlier demand. I choose N=20 (capped at 20) to capture the most recent ~20 periods after the regime change, balancing responsiveness and sample size. Lead time: use default (promised 0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0. mu_hat: recent_N with N=20 to set (1+L)*mean of last 20 demands so the backend's base_stock reflects current elevated demand. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=20 to reflect current volatility over the same window. These choices push the OR engine toward a higher target stock (matching higher recent demand) while keeping variance estimate aligned with recent experience; given profit >> holding cost, the backend will favor a high service level, and using recent data avoids understocking from older low-demand periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1709.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 context: on-hand=58, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments visible. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods (every conclude shows arrived same period as ordered). Recent demand (Periods 40\u201349) shows elevated but variable demand: [64,147,160,141,118,124,113,53,65,93], 10-period mean = 107.8. Profit per unit ($19) is high relative to holding cost ($1), so we should target a high service level. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent regime (mean \u2248107.8) rather than older regimes that differ substantially. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=10 so the safety-stock component reflects recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend toward a base-stock appropriate for the recent higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability; this balances the high profit-driven service level against modest holding costs.
