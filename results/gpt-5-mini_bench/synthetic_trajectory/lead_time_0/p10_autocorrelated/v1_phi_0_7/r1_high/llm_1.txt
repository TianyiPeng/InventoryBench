No evidence of a sustained shift. c) Lead time / missing orders: Supplier promised lead_time=0 but there are no concluded arrival messages yet to confirm actual lead time; therefore actual lead time is unknown. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Because arrivals happen after the decision phase, ordering is required to meet upcoming demand if lead_time=0; if actual lead_time>0 the order may not arrive this period, but we have no evidence to assume chronic delays. e) Final order logic: Aim to satisfy expected demand for the current period (~86 units) while keeping a small safety buffer given demand variability and high per-unit profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1). Ordering 90 units balances service level and holding cost. If orders later fail to arrive or lead time proves >0, adjust in subsequent periods based on concluded arrival messages.",

The only concluded real observation so far (Period 1) recorded true demand=124 but we stocked only 90 and sold 90 (stockout), so the single high-demand observation is insufficient to declare a sustained demand shift. c) Lead time / orders: Period 1 order (90) arrived in Period 1 with lead_time=0 periods (ordered and arrived same period). No evidence of lost shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0 at start of Period 2. With confirmed lead_time=0 so far, an order placed now can arrive in the same period and satisfy Period 2 demand. e) Final order logic: To maximize Profit*units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost*ending_inventory we should aim to meet expected demand this period because forgone sales cost (lost profit $19/unit) far outweighs holding cost $1/unit held for one period. Using the period-specific historical expectation (~97) while acknowledging the one high observed demand in P1, I place a moderate-upside order to cover likely demand but avoid excessive ending inventory.

These two periods imply true underlying demand near ~100\u2013110 units; Period 1 showed a stockout (demand >=124) so the best unbiased estimate is roughly the average of revealed demand and the stockout-limited sale: use ~110 units as forecast for the coming period. c) Lead time / missing orders: Orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 both arrived in the same period (conclude messages state lead_time was 0). While this is only two observations, both confirm promised lead_time=0 so an order placed now should arrive during Period 3 before demand is realized. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 5, In-transit = 0. No overdue or in-transit shipments. With lead_time=0 (observed), an order placed now will be available for Period 3 demand. e) Final order logic: To meet expected Period 3 demand (~110) while minimizing lost sales (very high profit per unit) and accepting small holding cost, order quantity = forecast demand - on-hand = 110 - 5 = 105.

Mean = 101.8 with realized range 66\u2013124 and recent two periods high (120,113), so demand appears moderate-to-high and somewhat variable. c) Lead_time vs. missing orders: Past concluded messages (Periods 1\u20136) consistently show arrivals same period as orders \u2014 lead time confirmed as 0 periods (already noted in carry-over).

Mean of these four = 83.75, but there is clear upward movement in the last two periods (104, 111). Earlier history shows frequent demand near ~100\u2013135 in prior high regimes. Demand is volatile but currently appears to be recovering toward the ~100+ range. c) Lead time and missing orders: Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving the same period (lead_time = 0 confirmed repeatedly). In-transit = 0 and no overdue/lost orders. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so no coverage for Period_41 demand unless we order now. With confirmed lead_time = 0, an order placed in this decision phase will arrive in Period_41 before demand is realized. e) Final order logic: To maximize profit (Profit $19/unit >> Holding $1/unit), prioritize meeting expected demand. Recent uptick (104, 111) suggests expected demand \u2248100\u2013110. To balance stockouts vs holding cost, order 110 units (covers expected demand with a small 5\u201310% safety buffer). This uses the lead_time=0 advantage to avoid excess pipeline inventory. If demand ends up lower, holding cost is modest ($1/unit/period) relative to lost profit per unit sold. ",

Demand for the current period (after decision) will occur without further arrivals (because arrivals occur same-period but are only visible after conclude \u2014 however historical confirms 0 lead time so orders placed now will arrive this period).
