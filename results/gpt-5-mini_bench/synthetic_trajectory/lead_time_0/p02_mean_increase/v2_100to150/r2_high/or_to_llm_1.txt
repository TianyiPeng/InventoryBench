{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Inventory & info state: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. No concluded periods exist yet, so we have no empirical evidence that actual lead time differs from the promised lead time (0). No shipments are known to be lost or delayed because there is no arrival history to examine.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 OR recommendation check: OR recommends 126 units. Reconstruct OR math to verify: historical mean demand = (110+116+74+101+85)/5 = 97.2 units/period. Sample std dev \u2248 17.46. With promised L=0, OR uses \u03bc\u0302 = 97.2, \u03c3\u0302 = 17.46. Critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645. base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 97.2 + 1.645\xd717.46 \u2248 125.9 \u2248 126. The OR cap equals the same value here, so order_raw = base_stock \u2212 pipeline = 126 \u2212 0 = 126 and OR final = 126.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook & risk: The 5-sample demand history shows moderate variability (sd ~17), recent samples do not present a sustained regime shift (only 5 periods total; no 3+ period consistent change). Product is regular chips (no calendar events provided). Holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so the optimal critical fractile favors stocking up to avoid stockouts.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Lead-time caution: Promised lead time is 0, but actual lead time could differ. However, we have no concluded arrival evidence to contradict promised lead time. Given current information, being conservative against stockouts is valuable because lost sales are costly (profit per unit $19) while holding cost is small. Over-ordering risk is limited.\n\nFinal decision: Follow OR recommendation and order 126 units. This aligns with the statistically derived base-stock level, matches the high critical fractile implied by profit vs holding cost, and is appropriate given zero on-hand and zero in-transit. We will watch subsequent 'Period conclude' messages for any lead-time or lost-shipment signals and adjust future orders if arrivals deviate from promised timing.\n",

That single-period spike could be a one-off, but it indicates downside of under-ordering: high lost-sales cost because profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1). 4) OR recommendation: 155 units. Given confirmed lead time = 0, no pipeline, high unit profit, low holding cost, and a recent realized demand much higher than the long-run mean, I prefer to follow the OR recommendation (155) to avoid another costly stockout this period. 5) Risk tradeoff: Ordering 155 when on-hand=0 will create holding cost only if demand falls well below 155; but given the prior period's strong realized demand and high profit margin, the expected profit loss from stockouts is larger than incremental holding cost. 6) Carry-over: Only one high-demand period observed (not the 3+ periods required), so do not record a sustained regime change.

{
  "rationale": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1) Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 both arrived with lead_time = 0 (Period1 order arrived in Period1; Period2 order arrived in Period2). This indicates actual lead time matches the supplier's promised 0-period lead time for the two observed periods. However, this is only two observations, so treat as likely but not incontrovertible.\n\n2) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 38, In-transit = 0. Because actual lead time appears to be 0, any order placed now will arrive during this period's arrival resolution and be available to meet Period 3 demand (and will be visible in the Period 3 conclude message). There are no outstanding shipments to rely on.\n\n3) Demand outlook: The OR baseline (114) is based on historical sample stats and promised lead time. Recent realized demand in the game history is elevated vs. the separate sample series: Period 1 demand = 156, Period 2 demand = 117. The sample set provided earlier (110,116,74,101,85) has mean \u224897, but the last two realized periods average (156+117)/2 = 136.5, suggesting a short-term upward trend. Given the profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding ($1), the cost of stocking an extra unit is small compared to lost-sale profit.\n\n4) Decision trade-offs: With profit >> holding cost, erring on the side of availability is appropriate to avoid stockouts. OR's recommendation of 114 already increases coverage relative to the long-run sample mean and implicitly provides safety stock. Our on-hand 38 + OR order 114 \u2192 152 available for Period 3 demand, which comfortably covers both the OR-implied expected demand and the recent elevated average ~136.\n\n5) Final action: Follow the OR recommendation of 114 units. Rationale: confirmed (though limited) 0-period lead time means ordered units will be available this period; recent realized demand is higher than the long-run sample mean; the profit-to-holding ratio strongly favors stocking. This approach balances avoiding stockouts against modest holding cost.\n\n6) Risk notes: If Period 3 demand falls back to the long-run mean (~97), we will incur modest holding cost on leftover units; if demand continues higher, this order reduces lost sales. Monitor arrivals and demand; only record confirmed lead-time or regime changes after a sustained (3+ period) signal.",

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead-time inference: Concluded-period messages show orders placed in Periods 1,2,3 all arrived in the same period (Period 1 arrived=126 ordered P1, Period 2 arrived=155 ordered P2, Period 3 arrived=114 ordered P3). This is consistent evidence (3 periods) that actual lead time = 0 periods, so any order placed now can arrive within the same demand period.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand analysis: Current on-hand = 62, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demands from concluded periods: P1=156, P2=117, P3=90. 3-period average demand = (156+117+90)/3 = 121 units. Sample standard deviation \u2248 33.2. With confirmed L=0 we only need to cover a single upcoming period. OR recommends 86 units (using its base-stock/cap logic). OR's recommendation embeds a large safety stock (q=0.95 \u2192 z\u22481.645) and its cap smoothing; however recent demands show a clear downward trend (156 \u2192 117 \u2192 90) and we have low holding cost but inventory already at 62.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Decision logic and final quantity: Because lead time is 0, an order now will directly satisfy Period 4 demand. Aiming to cover the expected mean demand (~121) is sensible given the downward trend and to avoid excessive holding. To bring total available (on-hand + order) to roughly the recent mean (\u2248121), order = 121 - 62 \u2248 59. Rounding to a practical integer and adding a small buffer, I choose order = 60 units. This reduces OR's 86 to 60: we accept less safety stock given the downward trend and the confirmed 0 lead time while ensuring roughly one period's expected demand coverage.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Risk tradeoffs: With profit $19 >> holding $1, the economic fractile favors more stocking; however the recent demand decline reduces the need for OR's higher safety stock. Ordering 60 balances risk of a miss versus excess holding. If demand rebounds unexpectedly, we can place another order (lead time 0) to top up in the same period.\n\nFinal action: order 60 units for chips(Regular).",

  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u20134) confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P4 arrived same period). Therefore an order placed now (Period 5) will arrive during Period 5 and be available to meet Period 5 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & demand facts: On-hand = 45, in-transit = 0. Historical sample demands: [110, 116, 74, 101, 85] \u2192 sample mean \u03bc\u0304 = 97.2 units/period, sample std \u2248 17.46. OR recommended 100 units (based on its capped base-stock using promised L). With L=0, expected one-period demand \u224897.2.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Objective math (approximate expected reward): Profit per sold unit = $19, holding cost = $1/unit-period. Expected sales \u2248 min(demand, on-hand+order). To maximize Profit*units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost*ending_inventory, we should bring available stock close to expected demand rather than substantially exceed it (excess inventory only increases holding costs by $1 per unit while each additional sold unit yields $19). Current on-hand 45 implies an order of about 97.2\u221245 \u2248 52 units to match expected demand and avoid leftover inventory.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Compare to OR recommendation: OR's 100 would raise available stock to 145, producing roughly 97 sales (\u2248$1,843 profit) and \u224848 units left (\u2248$48 holding cost) \u2192 net \u2248 $1,795. Ordering ~52 gives available\u224897, expected sales\u224897 (\u2248$1,843) and ending inventory near 0 \u2192 net \u2248 $1,843 (better). Ordering slightly above 52 (e.g., 60) yields small leftover inventory and slightly lower net reward.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision & risk: Because lead time = 0, the placed order immediately protects against stockout this period. Demand variance exists (sd\u224817.5), but the profit:holding cost ratio (19:1) is high, so marginally understocking is much more costly than small overstocks for service level. However, given current on-hand of 45 and only moderate demand uncertainty, matching expected demand is the best tradeoff now. I therefore order 52 units (rounded to integer) \u2014 this brings available stock to ~97, matching the one-period demand mean and minimizing unnecessary holding cost while preserving sales.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Carry-over insight check: No new sustained pattern meets the 3+ period/significant threshold (lead time already recorded).

Current visible inventory: on-hand = 3, in-transit = 0. With actual lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during this same period's arrival resolution and therefore be available to satisfy Period 6 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate & OR baseline: The OR recommendation is 139 units (it uses promised lead time and historical samples). Using the provided historical samples (110, 116, 74, 101, 85) the single-period empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 = 97.2 and sample std \u2248 17.45. For profit = $19 and holding = $1 the critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645.

Order_raw to reach base stock \u2248 126 \u2212 3 = 123. The OR recommendation (139) is modestly higher than this computed base-stock \u2014 likely due to OR's capping formula or slight numerical differences. Given confirmed lead time 0 (so no pipeline uncertainty) and only 1 period review (we only need to cover current period's demand after decision), I prefer the more conservative numeric base-stock target rather than OR's slightly higher suggestion to avoid excess ending inventory and holding cost.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Trade-off and final choice: Profit per unit is high ($19) encouraging service; however holding cost is non-negligible across periods if we overstock. With confirmed L=0 the order will immediately satisfy demand this period, so ordering to ~126 on-hand after arrival gives ~95% service consistent with our critical fractile while minimizing excess holding. Therefore I order 123 units (so expected on-hand after arrival \u2248 126).\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Monitoring & carry-over: Continue to monitor arrivals and sales to confirm demand regime; no new sustained pattern meets the 3+ period rule, so no new carry-over insight is recorded this period.",

There is no in-transit inventory.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate: Use historical demands (Periods 1\u20136: 110,116,74,101,85,106). Sample mean = 98.67 units/period. Sample std dev \u2248 16.02 units.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR baseline check: OR recommends 121 units. Recomputing the OR-style base-stock with L=0: \u03bc\u0302 = mean = 98.67, \u03c3\u0302 = \u03c3 = 16.02. Critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645. base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 98.67 + 1.645\xd716.02 \u2248 125.0 units. With zero pipeline, the uncapped order to reach base_stock would be ~125.0 \u2212 on-hand (20) = 105 units. The OR's 121 recommendation is slightly lower than base_stock but higher than our order-to-level calculation (OR may be using slightly different sample set or cap adjustments).\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Inventory & cost tradeoff: Because lead time is confirmed as 0, orders arrive the same period and we only need to cover one period of demand (L+1 = 1). Holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), which justifies keeping safety stock at the 95% service level; but we should avoid ordering more than needed to reach the base-stock level because extra inventory just increases holding cost without meaningful additional sales (demand is single-period and i.i.d. enough). On-hand = 20; target base_stock \u2248125; required order \u2248105.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final action vs OR: I reduce OR's recommended 121 down to 105 because (a) confirmed L=0 means we only need to top up to the one-period base stock, and (b) current on-hand covers part of that base stock. This preserves the 95% service-level rationale embedded in OR while avoiding excess holding cost from ordering on top of on-hand inventory. If future periods show a sustained demand increase or lead-time change, I will update the carry-over insight and adjust orders accordingly.",

Recent conclude messages (Periods 1\u20138) consistently show arrived = ordered same period, so we can rely on same-period arrivals.\n2) Inventory & demand: Current on-hand = 89, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand over Periods 4\u20138 = {77,94,106,125,64} => recent mean \u2248 93.2 units/period. Historical dataset (Periods 1\u20135 given earlier) also supports a typical single-period demand in the 80\u2013110 range. There is some variability but no clear sustained upward shift.\n3) OR recommendation: OR suggests ordering 53 units using its capped base-stock policy. That recommendation assumes using promised lead time and historical samples; it does not incorporate the fact we already hold 89 on-hand and that lead time = 0. With lead time = 0 we can top up within the same period, so we only need to order to cover the expected shortfall for the immediate period.\n4) Decision logic: With expected demand \u2248 93 units and on-hand 89, we expect a small shortfall (~4 units). Because profit per unit ($19) is much larger than holding cost ($1) we prefer avoiding avoidable stockouts, but we should also avoid excessive holding given we already hold 89 units. Therefore place a small order to cover expected shortfall plus a small buffer for demand variability. A conservative buffer of ~5\u201310% of mean (~9 units) is excessive given we currently have 89; a minimal buffer of 5 units is appropriate.\n5) Final action: Order 5 units. This brings immediate available inventory to 94, roughly matching recent mean demand (\u224893.2), minimizing stockout risk while avoiding unnecessary holding cost and overriding OR's larger suggested order which would materially increase holding cost without clear need.\n6) Risk notes: If demand in this period surges toward 125 (observed in Period 7), we may still stock out; monitor next concludes and adjust if a sustained demand rise appears.\n",

Therefore any order I place now will arrive before demand is realized in Period 10 and will be available to meet Period 10 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory snapshot: On-hand = 7, In-transit = 0. With L=0 there is no pipeline to rely on beyond the on-hand + same-period order.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand assessment: Recent realized demands (Periods 5\u20139) = {94, 106, 125, 64, 87}. Recent 5-period average = 95.2 units; demand is variable but shows a central tendency near ~95 units. Historical samples used by OR (older set) produce a higher OR recommendation (133) but OR does not weight recent observations or account for confirmed L=0.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Profit/holding tradeoff: Profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1/period. High profit relative to holding cost favors stocking enough to capture demand rather than risking stockouts, but we should avoid large excess inventory given demand variability (one period of holding cost applies to any leftover units).\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Order decision logic: Because orders arrive same period, we only need to cover one period's demand. Target inventory to cover expected Period 10 demand \u2248 95 units. With 7 on-hand, order = 95 \u2212 7 = 88. I round to a small even number for simplicity and to provide a tiny safety buffer against under-forecasting, so I place order = 90 units.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 How this relates to OR recommendation: OR suggested 133, which is higher than recent realized demand and is driven by OR's assumptions (promised lead time and older historical samples). Given confirmed L=0 and recent average \u224895, I reduce OR's recommendation to avoid excessive holding while still capturing expected sales. If demand spikes (e.g., 125 seen in Period 7), our high profit margin means future periods can be refilled quickly because of L=0.\n\nFinal: Order 90 units (arrives this period).

This matches the theoretically derived base-stock for a 95% critical fractile, ensures high availability given volatile but generally high recent demand (recent periods include 123 and 125 and a 156 peak), and holding cost is small ($1) relative to profit ($19). Ordering 148 balances minimizing costly stockouts (lost profit $19 per unit) with modest holding cost.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risks & mitigation: If demand falls sharply next period, we will incur holding cost $1 per unit for any leftover inventory; but given the large profit per sale and recent high demands, prioritizing service is preferred.

Because lead time = 0, an order placed now will increase available stock for Period 13 demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand estimate (data-driven check): Using realized demands P1\u2013P12 = [156,117,90,77,94,106,125,64,87,123,125,80], the sample mean demand \u2248 103.7 units/period and sample std dev \u2248 25.4 units.

The cap used by OR equals the base_stock for L=0, so there is no additional downward cap forcing 101.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision tradeoffs: Profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1/period), so the policy should favor higher service level and keep inventory close to base stock.

{
  "rationale": "1) Lead-time inference: Concluded history (Periods 1\u201313) shows repeated messages that orders arrived in the same period they were ordered; Period 4 carry-over insight already confirmed actual lead time = 0. I therefore treat lead time as 0 (orders placed this decision phase arrive during this period and will satisfy current-period demand).\n\n2) Inventory & recent demand analysis: On-hand = 12, in-transit = 0. Historical sample set given initially (Periods 1\u20135) yields mean \u224897.2 and sd \u224817.5, but more recent realized demands (Periods 9\u201313: 87,123,125,80,134) show a higher recent average \u2248109.8 and occasional spikes up to 134. With lead time 0, an order placed now will be available to meet this period's demand.\n\n3) OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 132 units. OR uses a high critical fractile (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q=0.95 \u2192 z\u22481.645) and caps its order; that logic pushes base-stock high to avoid stockouts. Given the confirmed zero lead time and elevated recent mean (~110) with observed spikes to ~125\u2013134, the OR recommendation of 132 is reasonable to preserve service while holding cost is low.\n\n4) Decision and justification: I place the OR-recommended order of 132. This yields on-hand availability this period of 12 + 132 = 144, comfortably covering expected demand (recent mean ~110) and the occasional spikes (up to 134) while keeping holding cost modest ($1/unit/period). Given the strong asymmetry between profit and holding cost, erring toward higher service is appropriate.\n\n5) Risk notes: If upcoming periods show a sustained drop in demand (3+ periods), I will reduce orders; if I observe any missing/concluded delays in arrivals (contradicting lead time = 0), I will adjust ordering to protect against pipeline gaps.

Use the provided historical demand samples (110,116,74,101,85) to re-compute the OR-style base-stock for a 0-period lead time: mean \u03bc\u0304 = 97.2 units, sample std \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 17.46.

I reduce OR's recommendation to 78 because: (a) with confirmed lead time = 0 we can top up exactly for the same-period demand, (b) statistical base-stock (using the given samples) implies a target \u2248126 not 142 (48+94), and (c) holding cost, while low, still penalizes excessive ending inventory each period. Ordering 78 will leave expected available inventory near the calculated base-stock and limit unnecessary holding cost while maintaining a 95% service level.  \n\n5) Risk notes: If recent realized demand in later periods begins to show a sustained upward shift (3+ periods of higher demand), we should increase the base-stock target.

Use L=0 for planning.\n- Inventory position: On-hand = 56, in-transit = 0. Because L=0, any order placed now will arrive during this period (and be available for demand this same period), so order immediately impacts ability to satisfy Period 16 demand.\n- Demand outlook: Historical sample set (provided training samples) has mean \u224897.2 units and std \u224817.5. More recent realized demands (Periods 11\u201315 = 125, 80, 134, 96, 70) average \u2248101, indicating demand remains near the long-run mean with variability similar to historical sigma. No sustained regime shift of 3+ periods is evident that would justify diverging from the baseline.\n- OR recommendation: OR suggests 86 units (capped base-stock policy using promised L). OR implicitly targets a high service level (profit >> holding cost). Given confirmed L=0 and current on-hand, OR's 86 would raise available inventory to ~142 this period, covering expected demand (~97\u2013101) plus buffer.\n- Tradeoff and decision: Profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), implying it is cheaper to hold extra inventory than to risk lost sales. Recent demands include spikes up to 134 (Period 13); with on-hand=56, ordering only the minimum (~40) would risk stockouts during high-demand realizations. Therefore I accept the OR recommendation of 86 units to preserve service and capture high-margin sales while holding cost is small.\n- Final action: Order 86 units. This order will arrive this period (L=0) and provide a comfortable buffer against observed demand variability.\n\nHow this ties to the decision checklist:\n1. World/calendar/product knowledge: Not applicable beyond normal snack demand; no seasonal spike identified.\n2. Reconcile pipeline/arrivals: No in-transit; L=0 confirmed; order arrives this period.\n3. Inspect OR recommendation: OR=86 \u2014 consistent with high service-level policy and recent demand patterns.\n4.

  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time and arrivals: Concluded history shows lead time = 0 (confirmed in Period 4 and all subsequent concluded periods show same-period arrivals). Therefore any order placed now will arrive within this same period and be available to meet Period 17 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory position: On-hand = 54, in-transit = 0. With LT=0, pipeline is effectively zero beyond on-hand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Use recent realized demand as the best indicator of near-term demand. Last five period demands (P12\u2013P16) = [80, 134, 96, 70, 88], average = 93.6 units. This aligns with longer-run variability seen in the history. Expected single-period demand \u2248 94 units.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 86 units. OR's base-stock logic aims for a target roughly at expected demand plus safety. With expected demand \u2248 94 and on-hand 54, ordering 86 would give available inventory \u2248 140 for the period \u2014 comfortably covering expected demand while leaving ~46 units ending inventory.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Profit vs holding tradeoff: Profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1/unit/period. The high profit strongly favors stocking enough to avoid stockouts, but holding inventory also costs $1 per unit this period. Ordering to fully cover expected demand (i.e., bring available to \u224894) is sensible. Bringing available inventory much above expected demand increases holding costs with diminishing return given already modest variability.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Final decision and justification: I will follow OR's recommendation of 86 units. This decision is consistent with the confirmed LT=0 (so the order will protect current-period sales), aligns with recent mean demand (~94) while keeping a modest safety cushion, and balances the high per-unit profit against the $1 holding cost. It avoids a stockout risk given the strong profit incentive and the observed demand variability, without pushing ending inventory excessively high.\n\nImplementation detail: Order 86 units now (arrives same period), which with on-hand 54 yields available stock of 140 for Period 17 demand.\n\n",

{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history through Period 17 shows every order from Periods 1\u201317 arrived in the same period (lead_time = 0). There are no in-transit units now, and the conclude messages are consistent with the previously recorded carry-over insight (lead time = 0). I will therefore treat actual lead time as 0 for ordering decisions.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate & OR check: Using the 17 historical demand observations (Periods 1\u201317) I calculate an empirical average demand \u2248 102.8 units/period and empirical standard deviation \u2248 25.1 units. With profit = $19 and holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645. For L=0, OR's base-stock = \u03bc + z*\u03c3 \u2248 102.8 + 1.645\xd725.1 \u2248 144.2. Pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) = 24. Order_raw = base_stock \u2212 pipeline \u2248 144.2 \u2212 24 = 120.2. OR applies a cap that, for L=0, equals the same base-stock formula, so OR\u2019s capped recommendation is \u2248120; the provided OR recommendation is 116 (close to this calculation).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Inventory implications & risk trade-offs: Because lead time = 0, any order placed this period arrives within the same period and can be used to satisfy current-period demand. Expected sales \u2248 103 units, so ordering ~116 will satisfy expected demand with safety stock and leave roughly 37 units of ending inventory (24 + 116 \u2212 103 \u2248 37). Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($19), so keeping safety stock to avoid lost sales is appropriate. There are no signs of lost shipments or regime shifts in the last 3+ periods: demands fluctuate but show no sustained jump or drop requiring a permanent deviation from the OR baseline.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final action choice: I accept the OR baseline magnitude. I choose the OR-recommended quantity of 116 units (rounded to integer) because it closely matches the computed base-stock ordering need given observed mean/variance and confirmed zero lead time, balances stockout risk versus holding cost, and there is no new sustained signal to change the ordering policy.\n\nNumbers summary: empirical mean \u2248102.8, \u03c3 \u224825.1, z*=1.645, base_stock \u2248144.2, pipeline=24 \u2192 order_raw \u2248120.2 \u2192 follow OR recommendation 116 (slightly conservative relative to order_raw).",

Demand analysis: Recent demand has trended up\u2014last four demands: 88, 116, 152, 238 (avg = 148.5); the most recent two average 195, and Period 19 spiked to 238. OR recommendation: 170 units.

Decision logic: Because lead time = 0 we can respond immediately; given the very high profit relative to holding cost, the cost of a stockout is large compared to holding.

There are no in-transit units now, and all past orders have concluded on the same period they were placed, so I trust same-period arrivals going forward.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate: OR uses historical samples; the provided historical sample set (Periods 1\u20135: 110,116,74,101,85) gives mean \u03bc\u0304 = 97.2 and sample std dev \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 17.46.

With lead time 0, current period demand will be served from on-hand after any same-period arrival, but because arrivals are same-period and we place the order before arrivals, we must ensure on-hand + order \u2248 base-stock to cover this period and target safety stock.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Reconciling with OR recommendation: OR recommends 63 units. My base-stock calculation implies order_raw = base_stock \u2212 pipeline = 126 \u2212 106 = 20 units. OR's recommendation is higher than the conservative base-stock top-up. Recent history shows occasional spikes (Period 19 demand=238, Period 18=152) but these appear episodic, not a sustained regime shift. Holding cost is low ($1) but profit is high \u2014 however ordering excessive units now risks raising ending inventory without evidence of a sustained higher mean.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Final decision: I order 20 units to top the on-hand up to the calculated base-stock \u2248126. This is a conservative adjustment that: (a) uses confirmed lead time=0 so replenishment is immediate, (b) respects the empirically computed safety stock from recent sample statistics, and (c) avoids over-ordering based on isolated spikes. If future periods show a sustained increase in mean demand (\u22653 periods), I will raise the base-stock and record a carry-over insight.\n\nNumeric summary: base_stock \u2248126, pipeline=106 \u2192 order = max(0,126\u2212106)=20.

Therefore an order placed now will arrive during Period 23 and be available to satisfy Period 23 demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory posture: On-hand = 59, in-transit = 0. With L=0 we must ensure order + on-hand covers current-period demand (L+1 = 1 period coverage).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Recent realized demand has risen compared with the earliest samples. The last five realized demands (Periods 18\u201322) are [152, 238, 94, 136, 179] with mean \u2248 160 units and noticeable volatility (sample sd \u2248 54). Given the product's economics (profit = $19, holding = $1) our critical fractile is high (q = 19/20 = 0.95) which calls for substantial safety stock to avoid costly stockouts. OR recommends 116 units but that recommendation likely underweights the recent uptick in mean demand.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Strategy and final order sizing: I increase OR's recommendation to provide enough supply this period to meet the recent average demand while keeping some restraint given demand volatility. On-hand 59 + OR(116) = 175 available \u2014 that would likely meet average demand (~160) but gives limited buffer against above-average realizations. To provide a clearer buffer while not grossly overstocking (holding cost is low but still positive), I order 160 units. That brings expected available inventory this period to 219 units (59 + 160), which covers the recent mean (~160) plus ~60 units of upside buffer (~1.1\u03c3). This reduces the risk of a stockout on high-demand realizations (e.g., 238) while keeping holding costs moderate.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Operational notes: Because lead time = 0, this order will arrive in Period 23 and be consumed in the same period if demand occurs. There are no in-transit units currently. I do not record a new carry-over insight because the demand uptick is not yet a sustained regime shift (signal is noisy and not consistently elevated for 3+ periods).

Recent demand has been elevated: last five period demands (Periods 20\u201324) = [94, 136, 179, 132, 131], average \u2248 134.4. Historical early-sample mean (Periods 1\u20135) was ~97, but the recent regime is clearly higher and sustained over multiple periods. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) vs profit $19/unit, giving a critical fractile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95 (z* \u2248 1.645), so policy targets high fill rate and significant safety stock.\n\nOR recommendation: OR (capped base-stock) recommends ordering 148 units. That recommendation assumes the promised lead time and historical demand; given actual lead time = 0, the OR order would arrive and be available to meet Period 25 demand.\n\nDecision logic and adjustment: Because actual lead time is confirmed as 0, ordering now immediately augments on-hand before demand. Recent demand is materially above earlier periods (recent 5-period mean \u2248 134), so we should maintain a high service level. OR's recommended order of 148 aligns with covering expected near-term demand plus safety stock under q=0.95. With on-hand 26, placing OR's full recommended order will give starting-on-demand inventory \u2248174, which covers expected demand (~134) and leaves modest safety stock.

  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Carry-over insight already recorded (from Period 4) confirms actual lead time = 0 periods. That means any order placed now will arrive during this same period (but will only be visible in the conclude message next period). There are currently no in-transit units.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory state: On-hand = 5 units, In-transit = 0. With lead time 0, we must ensure on-hand + order covers expected demand for the current period (since demand happens after decision).\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Recent demand assessment: Recent realized demands (Periods 23\u201327) = [132, 131, 125, 139, 169], average = 139.2 units/period, sample standard deviation \u2248 17.4 units. This recent 5-period window shows demand materially above the very small initial sample set; it appears demand is elevated in recent periods, so I bias the forecast to recent data rather than the OR\u2019s long-history estimate.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 172 units (uses promised L and historical averages). With profit = $19 and holding = $1, critical fractile q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645.

Desired base_stock \u2248 168 \u21d2 order_raw = 168 \u2212 5 = 163 units. I round to an integer order and place 163 units. This is slightly below OR\u2019s 172 because I used recent realized demand mean and explicit recent-sample sigma; it still preserves a high service level appropriate to the high profit/low holding cost tradeoff.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Risk & operational notes: With lead time = 0, this order will arrive during the current period, so we\u2019ll be able to meet most of the anticipated demand immediately. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit, so keeping safety stock to avoid lost sales is appropriate.

Therefore orders placed now will arrive within this same period's arrival resolution and will be available to meet Period 29 demand. No in-transit stock is outstanding (In-transit=0).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Current inventory state: On-hand = 62 units, In-transit = 0.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Recent demand has been higher than the early-sample average. I focus on the most recent 5 periods (P24\u2013P28 demands = 131, 125, 139, 169, 106) because they reflect the current regime. Recent 5-period mean demand = (131+125+139+169+106)/5 = 134 units. Sample std dev over those 5 = ~23.1 units.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Service-level objective driven by economics: Profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 19/(19+1)=0.95. z* = \u03a6\u22121(0.95) \u2248 1.645.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Base-stock target for lead_time L=0: base_stock = \u03bc + z*\xb7\u03c3 \u2248 134 + 1.645\xd723.05 \u2248 172 units. With on-hand 62 and no pipeline, order_raw = base_stock \u2212 on_hand = 172 \u2212 62 = 110 units.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Compare to OR: OR recommended 114 units (it used a different historical sample and promised lead time). My calculation uses recent demand (mean 134) and confirmed lead time 0; the recommended order to hit the calculated base-stock is 110 units (slightly lower than OR's 114). Given the high profit-to-holding ratio, I keep the aggressive service level but target the rounded quantity that brings on-hand to the computed base-stock.\n\nStep 7 \u2014 Risk checks: Lead time confirmed 0 reduces need for pipeline coverage. Ordering 110 units yields starting inventory after arrival of 172, which covers expected demand (134) plus safety stock (\u224838) to protect against variability. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit, so carrying this safety stock is justified.\n\nFinal decision: Order 110 units of chips(Regular) this period so arrivals (same-period) bring on-hand to ~172 units to meet expected demand and maintain a 95% service-target safety stock.\n",

With L=0, any order placed this period will arrive during the same period and be available for immediate demand.\n- Demand evidence: Full history (Periods 1\u201329) shows a higher mean and substantial variability compared with the small 5-sample set. The average demand over Periods 1\u201329 \u2248 121 units/period with frequent high-demand spikes (e.g., 238, 200, 179). Demand volatility is material.\n- Cost parameters: Profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95, corresponding safety factor z* \u2248 1.645. High profit relative to holding cost justifies carrying safety stock to avoid stockouts.\n- OR baseline: Recommends ordering 161 units.

If future periods show a sustained drop in mean demand for 3+ periods, I would revise downward; no such sustained drop is evident now.\n\nExecution: Order 161 units (will arrive same period).",

There are no in-transit units and no overdue/lost shipments to account for.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory state: On-hand = 6, In-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during this period and can be used to satisfy Period 31 demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand evidence: Recent realized demands are elevated. The last five periods' demands (Periods 26\u201330) are: 139, 169, 106, 156, 171; average = 148.2 units/period and substantial variance but skewed high. Over the longer history demand frequently reaches 120\u2013170 in many periods, so single-period demand risk is material.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Cost tradeoffs & OR baseline: Profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1 \u2192 critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95, implying a high safety-factor (\u2248\u03a6\u22121(0.95)=1.645). The OR capped base-stock policy recommended ordering 174 units. OR used promised lead time (0) and historical demand; since actual lead time = promised, its assumptions about timing are valid here. OR's cap and high fractile appropriately bias toward stocking more to avoid lost sales given high profit relative to holding cost.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision & justification: With only 6 units on hand and a single-period demand expectation near 148, I will follow the OR recommendation of ordering 174 units. This provides adequate coverage for expected demand plus safety stock consistent with the high critical fractile, and with lead time = 0 the order will immediately offset the low on-hand. Holding cost is relatively small ($1/unit) compared with lost profit ($19/unit), so erring toward availability is preferred to maximize expected reward.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Operational notes: No new carry-over insight (no sustained regime shift beyond the previously recorded lead-time confirmation).

With L=0, any order placed now will arrive during the current period and can be used to satisfy this period's demand.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: Current on-hand = 49, in-transit = 0. Because L=0, placing an order will immediately add to on-hand before demand is realized this period.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Recent realized single-period demands (especially Periods 26\u201331: 139, 169, 106, 156, 171, 131) average roughly 145 units and show variability. The product has high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), so the optimal service target is high (critical fractile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, z* \u2248 1.645). The OR baseline (130 units) uses historical demand and the promised lead time; it aims for a high service level but is slightly below the recent 6-period average of ~145.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision logic vs OR recommendation: Given (a) L=0 so orders are immediately usable, (b) current on-hand is only 49, (c) recent single-period demand is higher than OR's implicit single-period target, and (d) holding cost is very low relative to profit, the risk of under-ordering (lost sales) is costlier than the small extra holding cost. OR recommends ordering 130 units. Ordering 130 will raise available stock to 179 this period (49 + 130), which comfortably covers the recent average ~145 and provides safety stock for variability.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final action: Follow the OR recommendation (order 130). This balances OR's statistically-derived base-stock with the confirmed L=0 reality and recent elevated demand. It avoids stockouts at limited holding cost impact.\n\nAdjustments & monitoring: Continue to monitor concluded arrivals to reconfirm L=0 and watch for any sustained demand regime shifts. If forthcoming periods show a sustained increase (3+ periods) in average demand above ~160, I will raise the target; if demand falls and remains low for 3+ periods, I will scale orders down.

With L=0, orders placed now will arrive in the same selling period, so we only need to cover one upcoming period of demand (L+1 = 1).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand estimate: I rely on recent demand because it best reflects current regime. Using demand from Periods 25\u201332 (125, 139, 169, 106, 156, 171, 131, 158) gives an average \u2248 144 units/period. This recent average aligns with the last several periods (many 130\u2013170 observations), so I treat 144 as the expected single-period demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR suggests 159 units. OR\u2019s policy includes safety stock for multi-period lead and caps based on variance; because actual lead time is 0, most of OR\u2019s extra safety stock is unnecessary. Holding cost is low ($1) versus profit high ($19), so OR errs on the side of more inventory.

Ordering 173 units brings available inventory to 180 (7 + 173), which covers a high single-period demand realization and keeps expected holding costs low relative to lost-profit risk.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk trade-offs: Holding cost is only $1/unit/period while lost profit per stockout is $19, so biasing toward the OR's higher order to avoid stockouts is justified. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift requires adjustment. Therefore I accept OR's capped recommendation.\n\nFinal action: order 173 units for chips(Regular).",

Rationale: confirmed L=0 means same-period arrivals; recent demand mean (~152) plus a 95% service safety stock (~28) implies a target on-hand \u2248180.

With lead_time=0, any order placed now will arrive during Period 39 after the decision and be available for Period 39 demand (and visible in the Period 39 conclude message).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Demand assessment: Recent realized demand has been high and fairly stable. Using the most recent five periods (P34\u2013P38) demands = {162,132,121,156,147} \u2192 mean \u2248 143.6 units/period. This recent mean is representative of the more recent regime and is more relevant than the 5-sample toy series in the environment description.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 147 units (it uses historical data and the promised lead time). That recommendation aims to cover ~1 period of demand plus a safety buffer (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/20 = 0.95 \u2192 high safety factor). OR\u2019s 147 would raise starting inventory to ~181 (34 + 147), which matches past high-starting levels but will create larger ending inventory risk given only 11 periods remain in the game.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision logic and final order: With lead_time = 0 we only need to cover the upcoming period\u2019s demand (L+1 = 1 periods).

I prefer to target the recent mean rather than OR\u2019s more-conservative 147 to avoid unnecessary holding cost on inventory that may not sell before the horizon ends. Holding cost is small ($1/unit/period) but accrued over remaining periods if inventory sits unsold; profit per unit is large so stockouts are costly, but recent demand is consistent. Ordering 110 balances service and minimizes excess ending inventory.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Risk points & mitigation: If demand surprises upward (say 10\u201320%), we may understock by ~10\u201330 units. Because lead time = 0, we could still react in the next period, but that would sacrifice some sales if a spike occurs this period.

Therefore any order placed now will arrive during Period 40 and be available to meet Period 40 demand (and will also show as arrived in the Period 40 conclude message). No in-transit inventory is outstanding to consider.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory state: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. We must rely entirely on the order we place now to satisfy immediate demand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand evidence: The OR baseline was computed using older/statistical assumptions and recommends 184 units. Recent realized demand in the concluded periods is materially higher than the small 5-sample example earlier; recent actual demands (Periods 36\u201339) are: 121, 156, 147, 185 with an average \u2248 152.3. Looking slightly further back shows many periods with demand in the 120\u2013180 range. This suggests the true near-term single-period demand is closer to ~150 than the small-sample mean (~97) used in the toy-statistics example.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Cost tradeoff & service target: Profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1 per unit/period gives a critical fractile q = 19/20 = 0.95 (high service bias). That justifies keeping safety stock to avoid lost sales. However, holding cost is not zero and we are late in the horizon (Period 40 of 50), so excessive ending inventory will be carried for multiple remaining periods and penalized repeatedly.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Decision logic & adjustment vs OR: OR recommends 184 units (it uses promised lead time and historical samples). Given confirmed lead time = 0, arriving immediately, and the recent rolling average demand \u2248152, I will lower OR's recommendation to avoid unnecessary multi-period holding cost while still maintaining high service. Ordering 160 units covers the recent mean demand (~152) plus a modest safety buffer (\u22485%) to protect against variability and because unit profit >> holding cost. If demand spikes to OR-level (e.g., 184), we may stockout some units this period, but the expected profit lost on a few stockouts is small relative to the cost of carrying large excess inventory for up to 10 remaining periods.\n\nNumeric checks: recent mean \u2248152; chosen order = 160 (\u2248 +8 units of safety). Expected immediate profit per additional unit sold \u2248 $19, holding cost per remaining period = $1 (and there are up to 10 periods left). Ordering an extra 24 units to reach OR=184 would incur at least $24 per period in holding if unsold, and multiply by remaining periods this becomes costly. Therefore 160 is a balanced, evidence-based choice.\n\nStep 6 \u2014 Execution & memory: Place order of 160 units now (arrives this period). No new carry-over insight to record \u2014 lead time = 0 already captured previously.\n\nSummary: Confirmed lead time = 0, on-hand 0 so order must meet immediate demand; recent realized demand ~152 \u2192 order 160 (a modest safety buffer) rather than OR's 184 to limit extended holding costs over remaining horizon.",

Demand analysis: recent history shows high and variable single-period demand (examples: Period_42 demand=190, Period_39 demand=185, many periods >120). Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) relative to profit ($19/unit), so the optimal service-critical fractile is very high (q = 19/(19+1)=0.95), which justifies keeping a large base-stock. OR recommendation: OR (capped base-stock) suggests ordering 185 units using promised lead time and historical demand. Adjustment decision: Because actual lead time = 0 (so orders arrive immediately and will serve current-period demand) and we have essentially zero on-hand coverage, I will follow the OR recommendation of 185 units. This replenishes on-hand inventory to cover current high single-period demand while respecting OR's cap that smooths extreme swings. Risk trade-offs: Ordering 185 when holding cost is low trades some holding cost for avoiding lost sales at a much higher profit per unit; given recent spikes (190 sold last period) under-ordering risks stockouts and large lost profit.

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 61, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand (Periods 40\u201344) = [154, 119, 190, 116, 124], mean \u2248 140.6, sample SD \u2248 31.5. OR recommended 124 units based on historical averages and the promised lead time; OR tends to be conservative when recent demand has risen. Policy and safety: Given profit = $19 and holding = $1, the critical fractile q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 \u2192 z* \u2248 1.645 (high safety stock weight).

Rationale for adjusting OR: OR's recommendation of 124 is below the safety-stock adjusted target when using recent demand; with lead time confirmed 0 the order arrives immediately so ordering to raise on-hand to the base-stock target reduces stockout risk this period. Holding cost is low relative to profit, and there are only 6 periods left in the horizon, so the risk of a slightly elevated ending inventory is acceptable compared to lost sales.

Historical demand samples provided for chips(Regular) (periods 1\u20135 in the problem statement) are: 110, 116, 74, 101, 85. Empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 = 97.2 units/period. Empirical sample std \u2248 17.46 units. With promised lead time L=0, the OR baseline would compute \u03bc\u0302 = 97.2 and \u03c3\u0302 = 17.46.

The OR recommendation (164) is substantially higher than that target; possible causes: OR uses a longer history (beyond the five samples provided here) or different variance estimate. However, given: (a) confirmed lead time = 0 so we can top up to the base-stock immediately, (b) holding cost is low but not zero, and (c) recent observed mean demand ~97 units, ordering up to ~126 pipeline is appropriate and aligns with the OR methodology applied to the recent samples.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Final strategy: Place order = 104 units. That brings expected on-hand after arrival to 22 + 104 = 126 units, which matches the base-stock target calculated from recent demand samples and the 95% service fractile the OR uses. This reduces the large inventory swing implied by OR=164 while maintaining a high service level given the high profit-to-holding ratio and confirmed same-period lead time.\n\nRisk notes: If true long-run demand is higher than the five-sample estimate (e.g., OR's recommendation reflects longer-run higher mean), we may stock out more often; conversely, if OR's higher recommendation was overly conservative, my reduction saves holding cost. Because lead time = 0, we can respond next period quickly if demand deviates.\n",

{
  "rationale": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n1) Lead time inference: Confirmed actual lead time = 0 (carry-over insight from Period 4: multiple concluded messages show orders arriving in the same period they were placed). Use L=0 for planning.\n\n2) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 13, In-transit = 0. Because demand for the current period happens after our decision and L=0, any order we place this decision will arrive during the same demand period (and only be visible in the conclude message next period). We therefore need order + on-hand to cover expected single-period demand (L+1 = 1 period).\n\n3) Demand outlook: Recent realized single-period demands (Periods 44\u201348) are: 124, 170, 172, 159, 142 (avg \u2248 153). Historical volatility is material but no clear sustained regime shift in the most recent five periods. Product economics: profit $19 vs holding $1 yields a high critical fractile (q=19/20=0.95) so we should bias toward avoiding stockouts.\n\n4) OR recommendation: OR suggests ordering 174 units using the promised lead time and historical demand; its cap keeps swings moderated. With on-hand=13 and no pipeline, ordering 174 would give starting inventory available to meet current-period demand of ~150+ plus safety stock consistent with q\u22480.95.\n\n5) Decision logic: Given confirmed L=0 (so ordered units will help satisfy current demand), a high profit/hard-to-stockout preference (q\u22480.95), and modest holding cost ($1), I will follow the OR recommendation. This keeps service high while the holding penalty is small. There is no new sustained pattern to record (no 3+ period shift distinct from past).\n\nFinal action: order 174 units for chips(Regular).",

Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Lead time & arrivals: Concluded history (Period 1\u201349) shows consistent immediate arrivals (orders placed in a period arrive the same period). Carry-over insight already records: lead time confirmed = 0. Therefore orders placed now will arrive during the current period's arrival resolution (but you will only observe that arrival in the next period's conclude message). Use L=0 in planning.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Inventory & pipeline: Current on-hand = 21, in-transit = 0. With L=0 we only need to cover the upcoming single period demand (L+1 = 1). There are no outstanding arrivals to cushion demand, so our decision must top up to the expected single-period demand minus on-hand.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Demand outlook: Long-run data are noisy but recent periods give the best signal. Look at Periods 45\u201349 demands: 170, 126, 159, 142, 166. Recent 5-period average = (170+126+159+142+166)/5 = 152.6 \u2248 153 units. This recent mean is a conservative and relevant forecast because demand has fluctuated but the last several periods center around ~150. OR's recommendation (167) uses historical-wide statistics and the high critical fractile (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 q=19/20=0.95) that pushes base-stock upward; however, OR assumes the promised lead time and smooths over long history, which in this case produces a higher number than recent realized demand.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision logic and trade-offs: Profit per unit is high ($19) and holding cost low ($1), which motivates stocking to avoid lost sales. But we already have 21 on-hand and L=0, so we only need to order to reach the expected single-period demand (\u2248153). Order_raw = 153 \u2212 21 = 132. To be slightly conservative (rounding and to avoid tiny overstock), I choose 131 units (close to the calculated shortfall) so ending available inventory after arrival will be about 152, matching expected demand.\n\nStep 5 \u2014 Final action & risk: Ordering 131 balances avoiding stockouts (we\u2019ll likely meet expected demand) against accumulating unnecessary holding cost. It is lower than OR's 167 because OR inflates stock for higher service using long-run stats; I prefer recent-demand-driven fill given immediate lead time and current pipeline of zero.\n\nNumbers summary: recent 5-period mean \u2248153; required order = 153 \u2212 21 = 132 \u2192 place 131 units (rounding to practical integer).",
