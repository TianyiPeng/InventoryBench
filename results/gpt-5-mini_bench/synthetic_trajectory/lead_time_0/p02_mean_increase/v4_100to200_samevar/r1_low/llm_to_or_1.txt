Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrival history yet (no evidence to adjust lead time). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) have mean=91 units and moderate variability (one low outlier at 36 but not a sustained shift). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so the critical ratio q=0.5 implies targeting the mean demand (no conservative overweighting). Given lack of concluded lead-time observations or sustained demand regime change, use default lead time (promised), default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base-stock from the full-sample mean and std. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively while we wait for arrival/conclude messages to detect any lead-time or demand shifts.

=== Period 1 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $33.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 context: on-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrival shows the Period_1 order (ordered P1) arrived in P1, so observed lead time = 0 so far. Demand history samples: [105,36,108,110,96], mean = 91.0, population std \u2248 27.92. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so critical fractile q = 0.5 (z* = 0) and base_stock reduces to mu_hat. I choose to trust the promised lead time (use default L) because we have direct conclude evidence confirming a 0-period lead time. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, which yields mu_hat \u2248 91 and sigma_hat \u2248 27.92; this balances service level (z*=0 implies median stock) against holding cost given equal profit/holding. This approach is conservative given limited history and one confirmed short lead time; it avoids overreacting to the large low demand outlier in Period_2 sample by using the full-sample statistics.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period_1 order: ordered P1, arrived P1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $87.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 3 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows two orders (P1 and P2) arrived within the same period they were ordered: observed lead times = 0 for both concluded arrivals, so actual lead time appears to be 0. Demand historical samples for chips(Regular) are provided (Period_1..Period_5: 105,36,108,110,96). I see no evidence of a sustained demand regime change: the provided sample series is reasonably stable (mean ~ 91) and there are only two recent concluded demands (62,161) which are insufficient to declare a sustained shift. There are no overdue or missing shipments to flag. Because concluded lead-time evidence is consistent (0 periods), I set L to be the average of observed lead times so backend uses observed lead time=0. For demand forecast I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine computes base_stock from the full-sample mean/variance; this is conservative and avoids overreacting to the short, high demand spike in Period 2. With profit = holding cost, the critical fractile is 0.5 (z* \u2248 0) so the system will target roughly the mean demand across the review+lead period; using defaults lets the OR engine implement that directly. This balances service level versus holding cost given no strong sustained signal to alter the demand estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $55.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 decision. Recent concluded history shows arrivals with lead_time=0 for prior orders (P1\u2192P1, P2\u2192P2, P3\u2192P3), so I confirm actual lead time is 0. Concluded demand in recent periods: P1 demand=62, P2 demand=161, P3 demand=76. The recent 3-period average demand = 99.67 units/period. On-hand = 21, in-transit = 0; with L=0 we must cover (1+L)=1 period of demand after ordering because arrivals occur same period. I choose L by calculating from observed lead times (will yield 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent regime (mean ~99.67) and reduce influence of older, possibly different samples. For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect current demand variability (sample std \u2248 46.9). These choices instruct the OR engine to set base-stock around the recent demand level while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variance, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5 yields moderate z). No overdue shipments are observed (arrivals match orders).

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 context: confirmed historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P4 arrived same period). On-hand = 40, in-transit = 0. Historical demand samples provided (Period_1..5 = 105, 36, 108, 110, 96) have mean = 91 and sample std \u2248 27.9. Promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0, so use an L estimate based on observed lead times. Using mu_hat default yields (1+L)\xd7mean_all = 1\xd791 = 91 units demand across review+lead period; sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all \u2248 27.9. This keeps the OR backend base-stock anchored to the full-sample demand mean while respecting the confirmed zero lead time; it balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the z* service quantile from profit/(profit+holding)=0.5. Given on-hand 40 and no in-transit, this will prompt ordering up toward the base stock implied by mu_hat and sigma_hat while avoiding excess safety stock because lead time is short and holding cost equals profit.

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start. Recent concluded history shows arrivals with lead time 0 confirmed previously; on-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples will be used with the backend defaults so base-stock reflects full-sample mean and variance scaled by (1+L). Using default L keeps promised lead time (0) consistent with observed concludes; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). This avoids overfitting to short-term noise while the pipeline is empty and on-hand is modest.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_7. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1-6) show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent realized demands (Periods 1-6) = [62, 161, 76, 60, 64, 111], mean \u2248 89. I choose to set lead time by calculation from observed concluded lead times (will be 0). For demand forecast and volatility I use the defaults so the backend uses the full sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps the forecast anchored to all observed demand, avoids overreacting to the single high spike (161) while acknowledging recent variability. With L=0 and mu_hat/sigma_hat defaults the OR engine will compute a base-stock that balances the equal profit and holding costs (profit=holding \u2192 service quantile ~0.5) and the capped order prevents excessive orders given observed variability. This should restore on-hand inventory quickly from zero while controlling holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $40.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_8. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-7) shows moderate variability with no sustained regime change: demands = [62,161,76,60,64,111,65], overall mean \u2248 85.6 and no 3+ period sustained shift. All concluded arrivals (P1\u2013P7) indicate actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrived same period). On-hand = 25, in-transit = 0, so pipeline is empty; next-period demand likely near historical mean. I choose to (1) have the backend calculate L from observed lead times to confirm 0, (2) use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples\u2014this leverages the full sample set rather than overfitting to short recent swings. This balances service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and avoids overreacting to the large but isolated spike in Period 2. If future periods show a sustained demand shift or lead-time changes (\u22653 periods), I will switch to a recent_N or explicit forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 decision. Recent history shows concluded lead times of 0 periods for every observed order (Period1\u20138 arrivals matched same-period orders) and demand history for Periods 1\u20138 = [62,161,76,60,64,111,65,123] (mean=90.25, std\u224834.9). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must order to cover current-period demand plus safety. Because all concluded lead-time observations are 0 and the promised lead time is 0, I use the default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with the supplier promise. I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples (captures full-sample demand mean of 90.25 and volatility \u224834.9). This balances the profit:holding tradeoff (profit and holding cost are equal) by letting the OR engine compute the base-stock using the full-sample estimates; with L=0 the system will target roughly the single-period mean plus an appropriate z* safety factor. Given on-hand and in-transit are zero, this will prompt an order to replenish toward that target while avoiding overstating demand from short recent spikes (e.g., Period 2 and 8) because we have mixed demand episodes.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods 1\u20139) show variable but stable same-day arrivals: every concluded order (P1\u2013P9) reported lead_time=0. No shipments are currently overdue. Given confirmed same-period arrivals and no clear sustained demand regime shift, I use the observed lead-time estimate and standard full-sample demand statistics so the OR engine can compute a base-stock that balances $1 profit vs $1 holding cost. L set by calculation (average observed lead times = 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this leverages all available demand history to avoid overreacting to recent noise while ensuring adequate coverage for the current-period demand.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 context: on-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times from Period 1\u201310 all show arrivals same period (lead_time=0), so there is strong evidence actual lead time = 0. Demand history is volatile (recent demands ranged from ~36 to ~123) but the canonical historical samples provided (105,36,108,110,96) give a mean of 91 and std \u224828. I choose L='default' to trust the promised lead time of 0 (supported by multiple concluded arrivals). I choose mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided samples (i.e., 1\xd7mean and 1\xd7std). This keeps the base-stock anchored to the long-run sample mean while allowing the OR engine to trade off service level vs. holding cost using the exact profit/holding parameters. With very low on-hand inventory (1) and no pipeline, this will prompt the backend to order to reach the computed base-stock, restoring service capability while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit per unit.

Period 12 decision. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201311) shows consistent same-period arrivals; observed concluded lead times are 0 each time. Demand over Periods 1\u201311 has mean \u2248 89.6 units/period with substantial variability but no sustained regime shift (no 3+ period run at a new level). Current inventory: on-hand=24, in-transit=0, so pipeline (24) is well below the target implied by one-period demand. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) which yields q=0.5 (z*=0) so the OR backend will target roughly the (1+L)*mean demand as the base-stock. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) supported by multiple concluded arrivals=0, and use default demand estimates (all-sample mean/SD scaled by 1+L). This yields a base-stock near 90 units; with on-hand 24 the OR engine will place an order to refill toward that level, balancing service level and holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 decision. Recent realized demand (Periods 1\u201312) averages ~89.4 units/period with high variability (std ~29.5). On-hand=2, in-transit=0 \u2014 no confirmed incoming stock. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many periods with orders arriving same period), so I will trust the promised lead time. Because profit = holding cost, the OR backend's critical fractile q = 0.5; using default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) balances service vs. holding cost without overreacting to recent spikes (e.g., P2, P8). With L=default (promised 0), mu_hat default uses the full-sample mean \xd7 (1+L) and sigma_hat default uses full-sample std \xd7 sqrt(1+L). This keeps target base-stock near the long-run average demand (~89 units) while allowing the OR engine to cap order size by its cap calculation. Note: because on-hand + pipeline (2) is far below expected single-period demand, expect the OR engine to place a substantial order this period; with L=0 that order will arrive during this period (demand resolution follows arrivals) and help meet demand immediately.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 context: All concluded history (Periods 1\u201313) shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time = 0 for every concluded order), so actual lead time remains 0. On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to cover immediate (period 14) demand plus safety stock. Demand history (concluded demands P1\u2013P13) has mean \u2248 90.7 units and elevated variance driven by several large spikes (notably P2=161, P8=123). Given the confirmed lead time = 0, I select L using calculated evidence to let the backend use the observed lead-time average; for demand and volatility I choose the backend defaults to use all available samples so the base-stock and caps reflect the full history (mean ~90.7, std computed from all 13 samples). This balances service (profit = holding, so critical fractile q = 0.5) against holding cost by relying on the full-sample estimates rather than overreacting to recent spikes. No overdue or in-transit shipments to account for.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201314) consistently show arrivals with lead_time=0, confirming same-period arrival behavior. Recent demand is variable with several high-demand periods (e.g., Period 14 demand=140) so I will rely on the backend's default calculations which use all observed demand samples and the promised lead time. Using default L keeps promised 0 (consistent with confirmed lead time) so mu_hat and sigma_hat computed as (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, allowing the OR engine to set the base-stock and cap given the full history and the known profit/holding tradeoff. This approach balances service level against holding cost while respecting confirmed same-period arrivals; any needed adjustments will be made if future conclude messages show lead-time deviations or sustained demand regime shifts.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 start. All concluded history (Periods 1\u201315) shows actual lead time = 0 for every concluded order (arrivals occurred same period as order). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet Period 16 demand. Recent demand across history is volatile with several stockouts (many periods ended at 0), so keep the OR engine forecast conservative and let it use full-sample statistics. I choose L="calculate" to confirm the observed lead time = 0 from concluded messages (robust evidence from many periods). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose "default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively\u2014this leverages the full historical sample set and the confirmed zero lead time to produce a base-stock target that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost using the OR engine's service-level formula. This approach handles the lack of on-hand and in-transit inventory and relies on proven concluded lead-time observations rather than recent noisy short-run fluctuations.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 decision. Recent history (Periods 1-16 conclude) shows every concluded arrival had lead_time=0 (consistent across many periods) and there are currently on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Demand samples (Periods 1-16) are variable with an isolated large spike at Period 16 (227) but no sustained regime change (needs \u22653 periods). Promised lead time is 0 and concluded data support keeping L as default. Therefore use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs holding cost without overreacting to a one-period spike. If the large demands persist, future periods should switch to a recent_N or explicit forecast.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, confirmed lead time=0 from prior conclude messages. Historical demand shows a clear, sustained increase starting Period_13: recent demands (Periods 13-17) = [106, 140, 99, 227, 186], mean \u2248151.6 vs earlier Periods 1-12 mean \u224889.4 (+~70%). To ensure service while avoiding excessive holding cost, I use a recent_N forecast that focuses on the new regime. L: use default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. mu_hat: recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (N chosen per changepoint detection rules; regime length=5, N=5). sigma_hat: recent_N with N=5 to reflect current volatility in the new regime. These parameters will raise the base-stock to meet the elevated demand observed since Period_13 while letting the OR backend apply its cap to limit extreme orders and balance holding cost vs stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg demand increased from ~89.4 (Periods 1-12) to ~151.6 (Periods 13-17), +~70% sustained over 5 periods.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data shows actual lead time has consistently been 0 (many concluded arrivals same period) and a sustained demand increase beginning at Period 13: periods 13-18 demand = [106,140,99,227,186,210], regime length = 6. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach focused on the confirmed higher-demand regime: set mu_hat using the last N=6 samples (Periods 13-18) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of those recent demands. For uncertainty I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the higher volatility in this regime. This choice increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts under the new higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost weighting via the backend's service-level calculation (profit=holding cost => q=0.5) to avoid excessive overstock. No shipments appear overdue and no lost orders are observed.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. History (Periods 1\u201319) shows actual lead time consistently 0 (every concluded order arrived same period) and a clear sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 13 (periods 13\u201319 demands are much higher than 1\u201312). Recent periods (16\u201319) show very high peaks (227,186,210,171) with frequent stockouts at period-end, so service-level risk is high if we under-forecast. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 across many periods, so I keep L as default (promised). For demand location and dispersion I select the backend defaults so it uses all available samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this lets the OR engine compute the base-stock with the correct q = profit/(profit+holding) and its capped order. Using defaults also ensures the engine incorporates the full historical jump starting Period 13 when computing mean/std rather than my possibly biased short-window estimate. These choices balance the high cost of lost sales (profit = $1) against holding cost ($1) by letting the OR formula set z* and the cap. I note the urgent need to replenish (on-hand+pipeline = 0) to meet current elevated demand; the backend will translate the computed base-stock into an order this decision phase.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by past concluded messages (Period_1 order arrived in Period_1; many subsequent concludes show lead_time=0), so I trust L=default. Demand has shifted up starting Period_13 (previous carry-over noted). Recent realized demands (Periods 13-20 = 106,140,99,227,186,210,171,209) show a sustained higher regime; using a recent-window forecast will focus the OR engine on the new demand level. I choose recent_N with N=8 (the length of the post-changepoint regime available) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant observations. This increases the base-stock to reduce expected stockouts under the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat from the same recent sample captures current volatility. No evidence of new lead-time issues or lost shipments; keeping L=default minimizes overreaction to noise.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment (observed lead_time=0 for orders in Periods 1\u201321). Demand since Period 13 is in a higher regime (Periods 13\u201321 demand: 106,140,99,227,186,210,171,209,187 \u2014 9 periods). Given confirmed same-period lead time and a sustained demand increase starting Period 13, I set L to use the default (promised lead time = 0). For demand forecasting I use recent_N over the most recent regime (N=9) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 9 demands, capturing the elevated mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent volatility, which includes several large spikes (e.g., 227,210). With profit = holding cost, the OR backend will compute z* = \u03a6\u22121(0.5)=0, so base_stock centers on the mu_hat; using recent data ensures the order target matches current higher demand while avoiding excess inventory. This choice addresses the immediate need to cover expected same-period demand (on-hand+pipeline=0) and balances service level vs holding cost by relying on the confirmed higher-demand regime and observed same-period lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period across the history). Demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning at Period_13: recent periods (P13\u2013P22) have much higher demand than P1\u2013P12. To reflect the confirmed zero lead time and the elevated recent demand, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 0). For demand forecast I focus on the new regime: use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 13\u201322) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 10 samples; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 10 samples (recent volatility). This targets inventory to meet the higher sustained demand while avoiding excess holding: given profit = holding cost, service level implied is moderate (q=0.5) so using recent demand statistics prevents under-ordering from the elevated regime. No overdue shipments or lost orders are visible in concluded history.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period_13 (Periods 13-23 consistently elevated). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we have no coverage for upcoming demand; no overdue shipments observed (all concluded arrivals have lead_time=0). Promised lead time is 0 and concluded history repeatedly confirms 0, so use default lead time. For demand I use recent_N to capture the post-changepoint regime rather than diluting with low earlier samples: I choose N=11 (Periods 13\u201323) because the elevated regime has persisted for 11 periods. sigma_hat also uses recent_N with N=11 to reflect the volatility in the new regime. These choices give the OR backend an (1+L)-period forecast and volatility focused on the confirmed higher-demand regime, which raises the base-stock target to improve service while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand data.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: on-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). Demand has a previously recorded sustained upward regime starting around Period_13 (not new this period) with higher means; recent periods (P19\u2013P24) show high demand but no new sustained change beyond that already recorded. Given promised lead time = 0 and confirmed historical arrivals = 0, I keep L as default (use promised lead time). I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all available demand history to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std; this is appropriate because we have a known regime shift already captured in history and no new 3+ period sustained change that would justify switching to recent-only estimates. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) which implies a 50% critical ratio; using the backend's base-stock calculation on full-sample statistics balances service level vs. holding cost without overreacting to short-term noise. This decision also leaves headroom to replenish from zero in-transit and cover expected demand given L=0.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_26. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many concluded messages P1..P25 with lead_time=0), so I will trust promised lead time (L=0). Demand has clearly shifted up starting at Period_13 and the most recent five periods (P21\u2013P25 demands = 187,173,205,158,184) show a sustained high-demand regime with mean \u2248 181.4 and moderate variability. To balance service level (profit = $1, holding = $1, so critical fractile q = 0.5) and avoid stockouts that have been frequent in this high regime, I set mu_hat using recent data (most recent 5 periods) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat using recent 5-period volatility (sqrt(1+L)*std_recent). This keeps orders responsive to the confirmed higher demand while not overcommitting inventory given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27 decision: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period_13 (already recorded). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period). Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to cover this higher-demand regime. I therefore set L to 'calculate' so backend confirms observed lead time (historical concludes all show 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 13-26) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime: this uses (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 14 samples, giving the OR engine a forecast anchored to the new regime rather than diluting with low early-period demand. I apply the same recent_N (N=14) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand period while letting the OR engine compute the exact base-stock and cap using the provided profit/holding costs and observed lead time. No shipments appear overdue or lost in history; lead time remains 0 so arrivals will continue same-period per concluded records.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201327) consistently show orders arriving in the same period they were placed (many confirms of lead_time=0), so I trust the promised lead time. Demand shifted up starting at Period_13 and has remained elevated through Period_27 (sustained regime). I therefore set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand forecasting I use a recent_N approach using the entire post-changepoint regime (Periods 13\u201327 = 15 samples) because the uptick is sustained for 15 periods \u2014 per the rules N = min(regime_length,20) => N=15. I apply the same recent_N window (N=15) for sigma_hat to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices ensure the backend bases base_stock on the higher, sustained demand level while estimating volatility from the same recent window; this balances service level (avoid frequent stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost given profit and holding cost are equal.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (many periods of orders arriving same period). Demand history shows a sustained regime shift starting Period_13 (higher mean from Period_13 onward). Given current context we need the order to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon (with L=0 that is 1 period). To capture the post-changepoint demand level I use recent_N on the most recent regime (Periods 13\u201328, 16 samples) so the mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher demand and current volatility. This ensures the backend's base_stock matches the higher mean demand while sigma_hat from the same recent window captures elevated variability; with profit=holding the target service quantile is 0.5 (z*=0) so the OR engine will size orders close to the recent mean, balancing stockouts and holding cost. Because on-hand+pipeline=0, orders placed will directly replenish for the next period's expected demand under the new regime.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201329) consistently show orders arriving same period (many confirms of lead_time=0), and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period_13 (higher mean demand sustained through Period_29). No shipments appear lost or delayed. Given promised lead time=0 and strong evidence actual lead time=0, use the default lead time so the OR engine receives the promised L. For demand forecasting, use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 13\u201329) to capture the materially higher mean and variability: regime length = 17 periods, so set N=17. This focuses the base-stock calculation on the current higher-demand regime and avoids diluting the forecast with older low-demand data. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1), implying q=0.5 (OR backend will place zero safety buffer from the z term); centering mu_hat and sigma_hat on the recent high-demand regime reduces stockouts while avoiding excessive holding. No overdue arrivals to account for, so pipeline is zero and we rely on the OR engine's capped ordering policy to limit order size.

Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: demand has been at a higher regime since Period_13 (sustained higher weekly demand through Period_30). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the elevated regime. Observed lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so I use the promised/default lead time. For demand I focus on the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 13\u201330) rather than the full-sample mean to avoid underordering: I choose recent_N with N=18 (the length of the post-changepoint regime) so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 18 samples). Volatility also appears higher in the recent regime, so I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=18 to reflect current variability. These choices bias orders toward higher service (higher base stock) to avoid lost sales in the sustained high-demand regime while the sigma adjustment tempers extreme overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 decision. Context: on-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed repeatedly from Period 1 onward). There was a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 13 (carry-over insight): mean demand increased from ~89 to ~151+ and has persisted through Period 31. Pipeline is empty, so we must replenish for the higher-demand regime. Choices: set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 consistently. For demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to reflect the higher sustained demand and its variability. The regime from Period 13\u201331 spans 19 periods, so I choose N=19 (N capped at 20, and uses the recent regime length rule). These parameters will raise the base-stock to serve the higher demand while sigma_hat derived from the same recent window captures increased variability, helping the OR backend balance service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33 decision. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order: arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand exhibits a sustained regime shift starting Period_13 (higher mean sustained through Period_32). To keep service and avoid stockouts given current high-demand regime, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N to capture the elevated regime: the recent regime runs from Period_13 to Period_32 (20 periods), so I choose N=20 to base the (1+L)*mean on the most relevant data. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base stock to match the sustained higher demand while using recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost. If lead-time behavior changes later (delays or lost shipments), future periods should switch L to explicit or recent_N for lead-time and re-evaluate mu_hat/sigma_hat.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. On-hand = 14, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded history shows every past concluded order had lead_time = 0 (many periods confirming same-period arrivals), so promised lead time = 0 remains consistent and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Demand history (Periods 1\u201333) exhibits a sustained higher regime since Period 13 (previously recorded): recent demands are substantially higher than early periods. Given the clear, sustained higher-demand regime and reliable same-period arrivals, I keep lead time at the promised default (0) and allow the OR engine to compute base-stock using the full-sample mean/variance (default mu_hat and sigma_hat). This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) while letting the OR engine apply its analytic safety stock formula given profit=holding so it trades off service vs. holding cost. With on-hand 14 and no pipeline, the backend will order up toward the computed base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment (lead time=0) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 13 (higher mean sustained through Period 34). Given current zero inventory and sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 13\u201334), I bias the demand estimate to the most recent regime rather than all historical samples. L: use default promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals and the supplier has been reliable. mu_hat: use recent_N based on the confirmed post-changepoint regime \u2014 the regime from Period 13 through Period 34 is 22 periods long; cap to 20 for stability, so N=20 to focus the backend on the higher recent mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 samples). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture recent demand volatility. This combination gives the OR engine a forecast and safety stock calibrated to the higher recent demand, helping reduce stockouts (improves profit \xd7 units_sold) while keeping holding cost in check by not using older low-demand data.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period); demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period_13 (higher mean sustained through recent periods). Given confirmed lead time=0 and that the dataset already reflects the higher-demand regime, use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock tied to the full historical mean (which includes the post-Period_13 higher demand) and leverages the capped order cap. With profit = holding, the backend will target the median service level; using default preserves stability and avoids overreacting to short-term noise when no shipments are outstanding. Immediate action: place orders computed by the backend to replenish to the default base-stock given L=0 and the historical demand statistics.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many periods with 'arrived' same period ordered), so I will trust promised lead time of 0. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime from Period 13 onward (already recorded in carry-over), so the backend's default formulas (which use all samples) will incorporate that higher mean from the long history. Given profit = holding cost, the OR engine's newsvendor service quantile is 0.5; using default (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std is appropriate and conservative here. Using defaults avoids overfitting short-term noise and lets the OR engine compute base_stock and cap with the full-sample statistics. This also keeps orders consistent with observed same-period arrivals, and avoids artificially inflating lead time or forecast that could cause either stockouts or excessive holding. With zero pipeline and zero on-hand, the OR engine will place orders to reach its computed base stock.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (many periods: P1..P37 arrivals all concluded same period), so promised lead time = 0 remains valid. Demand regime shift previously detected (Period 13 onward sustained higher demand); recent periods (P18..P37) show substantially higher demand vs P1..P12. To focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N for demand estimates, capturing the most recent stable regime. Regime length since Period13 \u2248 25 periods; per rule I cap N at 20, so N=20 (uses last 20 demand samples) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. This centers the base-stock on the recent higher mean and uses recent volatility to size safety stock, which helps the OR backend raise order quantities to meet the sustained higher demand while avoiding excessive holding by not using overly long history. Given profit=holding, the backend will target q=0.5; these parameters ensure service levels reflect the new regime while controlling holding costs.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 13 (carry-over insight recorded previously). Recent realized demands (Periods 34-38) = [237, 199, 237, 208, 210], average \u2248 218.2. Profit and holding cost are equal (profit=$1, holding=$1) so critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z*=0 and base_stock equals mu_hat; therefore we must set mu_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime to avoid stockouts. I select L=default to trust promised lead time (supported by concluded history). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to target the most recent regime mean (captures immediate demand level \u2248218 units for one-period review+lead). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices push the OR backend to hold inventory near the current observed demand level (balancing service level vs holding cost given q=0.5 and z*=0). No overdue shipments are present (in-transit=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $219.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 start. All concluded history (Periods 1-39) shows every order arriving same period it was placed (observed lead_time = 0 each concluded arrival), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. On-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to cover upcoming period demand immediately. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), so the OR engine's critical fractile q = 0.5; using its default formulas with L=0 keeps a balanced service/holding tradeoff. I therefore set L to the calculated average of observed lead times (0) to explicitly reflect confirmed behavior. For demand parameters I choose the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all historical samples (Periods 1-39): this uses the full data history including the sustained higher-demand regime from Period 13 onward while keeping no extra subjective adjustments. This will produce a base-stock aligned with the backend's cap and the q implied by profit vs holding cost, replenishing to meet the current high-demand regime while avoiding unnecessary extra inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1-40) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders ordered in Pn arrived in Pn). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period_13 (previous carry-over insight). Recent demand (Periods 21-40) is elevated and more variable vs. Periods 1-12. To keep service while limiting holding cost with profit=holding ($1/$1), I keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. For demand forecast I target the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 demand samples, aligned with the sustained regime since P13) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 20 samples. This places base_stock around the recent mean with safety set by recent volatility, balancing lost-sales risk (profit = holding so critical ratio 0.5) against holding costs. This also responds to zero on-hand/in-transit by prompting a replenishment sized to recent demand patterns.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (actual lead time = 0 confirmed repeatedly since Period_1) and a sustained upward demand regime beginning at Period_13 (carry-over insight). Recent periods (P22\u2013P41) show consistently high demand (roughly 170\u2013239) versus earlier lower regime. No shipments are overdue or in-transit. Given the sustained demand increase (regime starting P13) I bias the forecast toward the recent high-demand regime rather than the whole-sample average. Parameter choices: L set to default (promised lead time = 0), so the OR engine will treat arrivals as same-period. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the most recent stable high-demand window while respecting the changepoint evidence; N=20 is chosen because the post-changepoint regime length is long (>20) and the policy guidance caps N at 20. I also use recent_N (N=20) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings push the base-stock up to cover (1+L) periods of the currently higher demand, improving service (reduce lost sales) while relying on the OR engine's z* tradeoff (profit=holding cost) to avoid excess holding. This balances profit from sales against holding cost given zero observed lead time and zero pipeline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 context: on-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 throughout (orders observed arriving same period), so promised lead time is still reliable. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 13 (user-provided carry-over insight), so I bias forecasts to the recent high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent sustained high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise (N chosen as min(regime_length,20); the high-demand regime spans many periods since Period 13). This increases the base_stock to cover the elevated demand and reduces stockouts given current zero pipeline, while capping over-ordering via the OR engine's cap and because profit=holding cost (q=0.5) the backend will target median demand. These settings balance service level (avoid lost sales given current low on-hand and no in-transit) against holding cost by reflecting the confirmed, sustained higher demand in the recent 20 periods.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime that began around Period_13 and continues through the most recent periods. Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus expected variability. Lead time evidence: concluded arrivals in history repeatedly show lead_time=0 (orders arrive same period) so I use the promised/default lead time. Demand choice: use the most recent 5 periods to capture the elevated regime (Periods 39-43 demand = 239, 217, 225, 170, 250; recent mean ~220) so the OR backend bases base_stock on the current high-demand level rather than longer historical lower-demand samples. Volatility choice: use the same recent 5 periods to estimate sigma to reflect current variability. These parameters favor meeting the elevated demand while avoiding excessive holding: profit and holding cost are equal, so the backend's target service quantile is 0.5 (z*=0) and using recent data prevents under-ordering in the high-demand regime. No in-transit inventory is expected (arrivals are same-period), so orders placed now will arrive this period per promised lead time.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 decision: recent history (Periods 1\u201344 conclude) shows every concluded order arrived same-period (lead_time=0 consistently). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we need to restock for current-period demand. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so critical fractile q = 0.5 (z*=0) \u2014 the OR backend will set base_stock = mu_hat. Given no new sustained shifts since the previously recorded demand regime change (Period 13) and lead time has remained 0 in all concluded messages, I choose the default lead time and default demand estimators so the backend uses its standard calculations over all samples. This balances service level and holding cost conservatively: default mu_hat provides the backend the (1+L)\xd7mean over all historical demands while sigma_hat default supplies volatility for the capped cap calculation. If future concludes show delayed or lost shipments or a new sustained demand change, I will switch to recent_N or explicit choices.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1-45) consistently show orders arriving same period they were ordered (observed lead_time = 0 each conclude), so I trust promised lead time = 0. Demand has a sustained higher regime starting at Period 13 (previously recorded); recent periods remain in that elevated regime. Because the recent higher-demand regime is most relevant for near-term service, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 demand observations to reflect current mean and volatility). Using recent 20 periods balances responsiveness to the sustained shift while providing enough samples to estimate variability. This choice helps the OR backend set a base-stock that secures service under the new higher mean demand without overreacting to single-period spikes. With profit and holding equal ($1/$1), service quantile is moderate; focusing on recent demand reduces stockouts given zero pipeline and zero on-hand.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 across many periods (earliest confirmed at Period 2 and repeatedly thereafter), so using promised lead time is appropriate. Demand exhibits a sustained higher regime since Period_13 (documented previously); recent periods (Periods ~27\u201346) show consistently elevated demand vs. Periods 1\u201312. To keep the OR backend responsive to the elevated, relatively stable high-demand regime while limiting excess holding cost, I use recent_N estimates based on the most recent data. I select N=20 to capture the last ~20 demand observations (recent high-demand regime) for both mean (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat). This gives the backend a (1+L)-scaled mean and std focused on current regime so base_stock will target service for the higher demand while the cap limits extreme over-ordering. Given on-hand and in-transit are zero, these parameters will cause the backend to order toward that revised base stock to restore inventory for immediate same-period demand (L=0) while controlling holding cost through the OR cap and choice of recent statistics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $197.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48 context: on-hand=7, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and concluded history (Periods 1\u201347) consistently shows actual lead_time=0, so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period_13 (previously recorded). To keep the OR backend responsive to the higher, persistent demand level I use the promised lead time (default L=0) and set demand parameters based on the most recent data from the elevated regime. I select recent_N with N=20 (the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 20 samples) so mu_hat reflects the current higher average demand while smoothing short-term noise. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=20 so the backend measures current volatility from the same window. This balances service level (higher base-stock driven by recent higher mean) against holding cost by limiting the window to the recent regime (capped at 20 samples per policy). No overdue shipments to cover; ordering with these parameters will let the OR engine replenish toward a base stock appropriate for the elevated demand regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $137.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision: recent history shows demand has been in a higher regime since Period_13 (sustained higher demands ~150-230). Promised lead time is 0 and concluded history repeatedly shows arrived orders with lead_time=0 \u2014 no evidence of new delays or lost shipments. Current on-hand=37, in-transit=0 so available inventory will not cover a typical high-regime period of demand; we therefore let the OR backend compute base_stock and order size using its default estimates so it uses the full historical sample set and the promised lead time (0). Using default L/mu/sigma keeps the backend's statistical estimates stable, lets it incorporate the confirmed regime shift present in the full history, and avoids overreacting to single-period noise. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by relying on the backend's base-stock calculation (which uses q = profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5) and its capped order size.

Daily Reward (R_t): $163.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 context: on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must restock to meet expected demand this period. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (many Period X conclude messages state arrived in same period), so I use a lead-time estimate based on observed lead times. There was a prior sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 13 (noted in carry-over history) \u2014 recent higher demand levels have persisted since then, so I do NOT downweight older pre-shift samples. Parameter choices: L set by calculating the average of observed concluded lead times (will reflect the persistent 0-period actual lead time). mu_hat and sigma_hat use the default rules so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). With Profit = Holding, the critical fractile q = 0.5 (z*\u22480), so the OR engine will effectively target the central forecast (mu_hat) while the cap limits extreme orders. Using defaults keeps forecasts anchored to the full-sample mean/volatility while leveraging the confirmed same-period lead time to avoid extra safety stock that would raise holding cost.
