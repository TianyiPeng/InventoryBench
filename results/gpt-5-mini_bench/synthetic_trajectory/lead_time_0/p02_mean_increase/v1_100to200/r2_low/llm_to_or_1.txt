Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand stock and no in-transit; no concluded arrival history to infer lead time changes or lost shipments. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) have mean = 101.8 units/period and std \u2248 25.4. Promised lead time is 0; with no evidence to the contrary I will use the default promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock using the full-sample mean and std. This keeps decisions simple and lets the backend apply its capped ordering rule; if arrivals later show delays or a regime shift I'll switch to a recent_N or explicit estimate in a future period.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period: Period_2. Context: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. From Period_1 conclude we observed that the order placed in Period_1 arrived in Period_1 (arrived=102, lead_time observed=0). Historical demand samples (provided) have mean = 101.8 units/period and moderate dispersion. Promised lead time is 0 and the single observed concluded lead time equals the promise, so I will use the default lead-time assumption. To let the OR backend compute a stable base-stock that balances $1 profit vs $1 holding cost, I use default demand inputs so the engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This keeps orders aligned with the overall historical average (\u2248101.8 units) while avoiding overfitting to the single-period sale constraint in Period_1 (where sales were supply-limited). If future concluded messages show delayed or lost shipments, I will switch to a calculated/recent estimate for L and adjust mu_hat accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. Recent concluded history shows two on-time arrivals: orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 both concluded with lead_time=0. On-hand = 23, in-transit = 0, so no arrivals expected this period. Historical demand samples (Period_1..5) have mean ~101.8. I choose to let the backend compute lead time from observed data (calculate) which will confirm the observed 0-period lead time, and use default demand/volatility calculations so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This is conservative: we have only two concluded lead-time observations (not enough to declare a persistent regime change) and demand shows some variability but no sustained, clearly shifted regime. Using defaults balances service level (backed by full-sample mean) against holding cost until stronger evidence of a regime or lead-time change emerges. No overdue shipments are visible.

Daily Profit: $70.00, Daily Holding Cost: $33.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $37.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 context: promised lead time = 0. Historical concluded lead times for Periods 1-3 all show arrivals same-period (lead_time = 0). Demand samples available: [141, 118, 67, 94, 89] (mean = 101.8, std \u2248 28.45). Current on-hand = 33, in-transit = 0. No overdue or missing shipments are observed in concluded history. Given consistent same-period arrivals over three concluded periods, I use the default lead time (promised = 0) so the OR engine treats arrivals as same-period. Demand shows variability but no sustained regime shift (the higher early value is not sustained across 3+ periods), so I use the default demand estimates based on all samples to give the OR backend a balanced forecast. Using defaults lets the OR base-stock calculation (which already balances profit vs holding cost via q) operate on full-sample mean and variance; this avoids overreacting to short-term dips and keeps service while controlling holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders placed P1,P2,P3 arrived same period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision at Period_5. Observed on-hand=0 and in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 arrived same period (lead time 0 confirmed). Historical sample demands (provided) = [141, 118, 67, 94, 89]. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1 profit, $1 holding) which implies service quantile q = 0.5 and z*\u22480, so the backend will target roughly the mean demand across the review+lead period. Given the confirmed lead time=0 and no evidence of a demand regime shift (no sustained 3+ period change in mean/variance), I choose the backend defaults so it uses all samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps the policy simple, avoids overreacting to recent variability, and balances service level vs. holding cost when profit and holding cost are equal. If future concluded periods show sustained change or missing arrivals, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start. Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P5) shows arrivals for every order with observed lead_time=0; demand samples P1\u2013P5 = [141,118,67,94,89] (mean=101.8, std\u224825.4). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover this period's demand. I set L using "calculate" to let backend confirm actual observed lead time average (all observed = 0 \u2192 L=0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use the defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (stable short series, no sustained regime shift). With profit=holding, critical fractile q=0.5 implies median service target; default estimators balance stock to expected demand while avoiding extra holding since holding cost equals profit per unit. No overdue or lost shipments detected in concludes (arrivals consistent).

Daily Reward (R_t): $45.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 start. On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals through Period_6 show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0), and no overdue shipments. Demand history (concluded periods) shows moderate, variable demand without a sustained shift (recent demands: 126,83,70,105,109,73). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so critical fractile q=0.5 (risk-neutral), meaning safety stock contribution is minimal. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no evidence of a new demand regime, use default statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(demand samples) and sigma accordingly. This balances service level vs holding cost by relying on sample mean for replenishment and avoiding extra safety stock when profit equals holding cost.

Daily Profit: $67.00, Daily Holding Cost: $31.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20137) consistently shows same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed). Recent demand by period: P5=109, P6=73, P7=67; the most recent 3-period average demand = 83.0 units. Current on-hand = 31, in-transit = 0, so stock is well below a one-period demand and we should order to cover expected near-term demand. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 each), so the OR backend will target a median service level (q = 0.5 \u2192 z \u2248 0), meaning base_stock will roughly equal the forecasted demand over the review+lead period. I therefore (1) keep lead time at the promised/confirmed 0 (use default), (2) use a recent_N demand estimate focused on the last 3 periods (N=3) because demand appears to have shifted downward after Period 5 and the most recent 3 periods best represent the current regime, and (3) use recent_N volatility over the same 3 periods to reflect current uncertainty. This combination directs the OR engine to replenish toward the recent realized demand level (limiting excess holding given equal holding and profit costs) while acknowledging the confirmed zero lead time so arrivals will be same-period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $83.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 decision with on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times for chips(Regular) are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P8 all arrived same period), so I let the backend compute lead time via observed data. Recent demand shows a one-period spike in Period_8 (157) but it is not sustained (isolated), so I will not treat it as a regime change. With profit = holding cost, the backend's default base-stock calculation using the full-sample mean and std is appropriate to balance service level vs. carrying cost. Therefore: L set to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0 from history; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'default' so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps orders responsive to average demand while avoiding overreaction to the single-period spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 10. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order from Periods 1\u20139 arrived same period (lead_time observed = 0 each time). Recent demand history (concluded periods) shows variable demand with no sustained upward or downward regime shift (demands: P1=126, P2=83, P3=70, P4=105, P5=109, P6=73, P7=67, P8=157, P9=107). Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by multiple concluded arrivals, so I use the default lead time so the OR backend treats lead time as promised. I also use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) respectively, letting the OR engine apply its base-stock and cap logic using the full-sample demand statistics. This conservative choice relies on confirmed lead-time=0 and no clear sustained demand regime change, balancing service level and holding cost without overreacting to short-term spikes (e.g., P8=157).

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 context: on-hand=11, in-transit=0. Recent realized demands (Periods 6-10) = [73, 67, 157, 107, 90], mean \u2248 98.8 and sample volatility \u2248 32.3. No outstanding arrivals are visible in-transit and recent conclude messages confirm lead time = 0 (no overdue shipments). I choose L via "calculate" to reflect observed lead times (all concluded arrivals show 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to emphasize the most recent regime (captures the large spike at Period 8 while smoothing prior lower values) so (1+L)\xd7mean is responsive to the current demand level. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) so the backend measures recent volatility (important because of the Period 8 spike) and sets safety stock appropriately. This balances service (covering recent higher demand) against holding cost given holding and profit are equal ($1 each) and on-hand is low (11) with no pipeline.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 start. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201311) shows frequent same-period arrivals (multiple concluded messages with lead_time=0) and current inventory is low (on-hand=5, in-transit=0). Demand has been variable recently (sequence of concluded demands: 126,83,70,105,109,73,67,157,107,90,94) but no sustained large upward or downward regime change is evident over 3+ periods. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead times consistently confirm 0, so I use the default (promised) lead time. Because demand shows variability but no clear recent changepoint, I let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat using all samples (default methods). This keeps the base-stock anchored to the long-run mean while the backend\u2019s cap limits large orders; with profit = holding cost, the implied service quantile is 0.5 (z*\u22480), which leans toward balancing service vs. holding cost. Given on-hand=5 and zero pipeline, this will instruct the OR engine to replenish toward the computed base stock to cover the current period's demand.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 decision. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201312) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time observed = 0 each concluded period) and no outstanding in-transit stock; on-hand = 16, in-transit = 0. Demand history (concluded demands P1\u2013P12) = [126,83,70,105,109,73,67,157,107,90,94,84], mean = 97.08 units/period, sample std \u2248 25.9. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) -> critical fractile q = 0.5 so z* = 0 and base-stock reduces to the demand forecast (mu_hat). Given the consistent evidence of lead_time = 0 and no sign of lost shipments, I use the default/prompted calculations so the OR backend will set base_stock = (1+L)*mean(demand) and sigma accordingly. Using defaults keeps calculations aligned with observed stable lead time and uses all available data (mean \u2248 97.08, std \u2248 25.9). This choice balances service level (50%) vs holding cost under symmetric profit/holding; with on-hand=16 the backend will likely order to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the mean demand for the review+lead window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-11.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 context: on-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 in multiple periods), and recent demand has ranged widely (past concluded demands: 126,83,70,105,109,73,67,157,107,90,94,84,44). Promised lead time is 0 and past concluded data confirm actual lead time = 0, so I use the default lead-time setting. Because profit and holding cost are equal ($1 profit, $1 holding), the backend's critical fractile q = 0.5, so a base-stock near the mean demand over the review+lead horizon is appropriate. I therefore choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample history; this leverages all available data and lets the backend balance service level vs. holding cost automatically. Using defaults also avoids overreacting to the recent dip in demand (Period 13 = 44) while still reflecting the full observed variability. No overdue shipments are present (in-transit=0); with L=0, new orders will arrive same period as placed per observed pattern.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand (Periods 1\u201314) has mean \u224896.7 units/period and std \u224831.0. Prior concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (already recorded). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1 vs $1) so critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, implying base_stock should equal mu_hat. With no new evidence of a demand regime shift or lead-time change and no overdue shipments, I choose the conservative/default approach: use the promised lead time (default L=0) and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples. This yields an order policy that targets approximately one period of expected demand (~96.7 units) without added safety stock, balancing service level and holding cost given equal profit/holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages through Period 15 consistently show orders arriving same period; lead time confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over. Demand history (available samples) has mean ~101.8 units. Given confirmed same-period arrivals (L=0) and no evidence of a sustained demand regime change, I use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base_stock from the full-sample mean and std. Using default L and default demand estimates keeps ordering responsive to observed variability while avoiding overcommitting inventory (important because profit and holding cost are equal). This balances service level and holding cost by letting the OR engine calculate the safety stock from the full-sample statistics with promised lead time.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201316 conclude show arrivals same period), so no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Recent demand samples (Periods 1\u201316 concluded demands shown in history; full sample set available) exhibit variability but no sustained regime shift\u2014demand spikes (e.g., P8,P14\u2013P16) are intermittent rather than persistent. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit each) implying an optimal service quantile near 0.5 (z*\u22480), so ordering to cover the forecast mean is appropriate. Given stable confirmed lead time and a lack of new sustained demand regime change, use default calculations: L = promised lead time (0), mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps the OR backend ordering to the mean demand over the review+lead period, balancing service level and holding cost while avoiding overreaction to short-lived spikes. No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted materially upward starting Period_14 (demands P14-P17 = 145,155,185,162). Baseline (Periods 1-13) average demand \u224893 units; recent 4-period average \u2248162 units (+~74%). Promised lead time is 0 and prior conclude messages consistently confirm 0 lead time. Because the demand increase is sustained over 4 periods, I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) and use recent_N (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory to cover the new, higher demand regime while capturing recent volatility. This helps the backend raise the base-stock to avoid frequent stockouts observed in P14\u2013P17 while keeping holding cost pressure visible (profit and holding cost are equal, so service-level changes are driven by the higher recent mean). With on-hand and in-transit both zero, the OR engine will compute orders to rebuild inventory to the recalibrated base stock for the current high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg demand increased from ~93 (Periods 1\u201313) to ~162 (Periods 14\u201317) (+~74%)

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 decision. Recent history shows a clear, sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14: demands in Periods 14\u201318 = [145,155,185,162,205] (avg \u2248 170). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, promised lead time = 0 and concluded lead times historically are 0 (orders in P1\u2013P18 concluded with lead_time=0). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1.0 each) so the OR backend will target q=0.5 (z*\u22480). To prioritize service during the new higher-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding, I set lead time to be inferred from observations (calculate) and use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes forecast and safety stock based on the confirmed high-demand window (Periods 14\u201318). No overdue shipments or lost arrivals are evident. These parameters steer the OR engine to replenish to a base stock reflecting the new higher mean demand while sizing safety stock from the recent volatility.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 14 (periods 14\u201319 demands: 145,155,185,162,205,203) versus earlier history. No overdue or lost shipments observed (all past orders since Period 1 concluded with lead_time=0), so promised lead time = 0 remains valid. To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime, I use a recent_N forecast over the most recent regime (Periods 14\u201319, length=6) for both mean and volatility. This focuses the base-stock calculation on the new demand level while keeping lead time at the promised (observed) 0, balancing service level (avoid stockouts in the higher-demand regime) against holding cost by not inflating variance window with older low-demand periods.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201320) consistently show arrivals in the same period they were ordered \u2014 strong evidence actual lead time = 0. Demand increased starting Period 14 (Periods 14\u201320 are noticeably higher than Periods 1\u201313). Recent periods (14\u201320) show very high demand (145,155,185,162,205,203,194) so I bias the forecast toward the recent high-demand regime. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to ensure the OR backend treats lead time as 0. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=7 (the length of the recent high-demand regime, capturing Periods 14\u201320) so the base-stock reflects the elevated demand; this reduces stockouts. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=7 to reflect volatility in the recent regime. These choices balance service level (avoiding lost sales during the sustained high-demand regime) against holding cost by limiting the forecast window to the confirmed recent regime rather than diluting with older, lower-demand data.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data shows a clear demand regime shift starting Period_14 (higher mean since then) and lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 (orders placed arrive same period). Given the sustained higher-demand regime from Period_14 through Period_21 (8 periods), I use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the new level and volatility. Choice details: L set to default so the OR backend uses the promised lead time (0), consistent with multiple confirmed arrivals at lead_time=0. mu_hat uses recent_N with N=8 to set (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 8 demand samples (Periods 14\u201321) so the base-stock targets the elevated demand level. sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=8 to capture the recent higher variability. This approach balances service (avoid stockouts during the new high-demand regime) against holding cost by restricting demand estimation to the validated recent regime rather than diluting with older, lower-demand data.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 decision. Current on-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly; earliest confirmation P4). A clear demand regime shift occurred at Period 14: mean demand before P14 \u224893 vs. recent higher regime. I base demand forecasts on the most recent stable high-demand regime (Periods 14\u201322 = 9 samples: demands = 145,155,185,162,205,203,194,244,183; mean \u2248186.22). Because lead time is confirmed as 0, use L = default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose recent_N with N=9 to reflect the new high-demand regime (N chosen = regime length = 9, within [3,20]). This provides the OR engine (which computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 9 samples) with a forecast that captures the elevated demand while avoiding contamination from the earlier low-demand periods. That should raise the target base-stock to reduce stockouts during the sustained higher-demand regime while the sigma estimate captures recent volatility so the capped order limit prevents extreme over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 context: on-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 (confirmed in earlier periods), and a sustained demand regime shift began at Period 14 with higher demand through recent periods. Recent demand (Periods 14\u201323) is the relevant regime for forecasting. I set L='default' to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 (the number of periods in the post-shift regime, Periods 14\u201323) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant high-demand regime. This approach focuses available inventory decisions on the higher recent mean while using recent volatility to size safety stock; with profit=holding, the backend will target a 50% critical fractile so prioritizing the recent regime helps avoid stockouts given current very low on-hand and zero in-transit.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period_14 (Periods 14\u201324 consistently much larger than Periods 1\u201313). On-hand = 16, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is very low relative to recent demand (recent daily/period demand averages ~170). Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded messages consistently show 0-period arrivals, so I keep L = default (0). For demand I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime: I select N = 11 (Periods 14\u201324 inclusive) because the changepoint at Period_14 created a new regime of length 11 \u2014 N is regime_length (11), between 3 and 20. Using recent_N for mu_hat gives (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 11 observed demands, which better captures the current elevated demand than the long-run mean. I also use recent_N (N = 11) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects volatility within the new regime. This choice helps the OR backend produce a base-stock that prioritizes service (avoid lost sales) during the sustained higher-demand regime while the equal profit/holding cost tradeoff will temper excess inventory. No concluded arrivals are overdue and no lost shipments are evident.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period delivery (lead time 0) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 14 (higher demand continuing through Period 25). Recent realized demand (Periods 14\u201325) is materially higher than Periods 1\u201313, so I focus forecasting on the post-shift regime. I select L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0. For demand, I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 14\u201325) so mu_hat reflects the new higher-demand regime and sigma_hat captures its volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to target a base stock sized for the elevated mean demand while using recent volatility to set safety stock; using recent data prevents under-ordering from the regime shift while avoiding excessive holding from older low-demand samples.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Recent history shows a sustained, higher-demand regime starting Period 14 (user historic insight). Current inventory: on-hand=41, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0, so I keep L as default. To reflect the sustained demand increase since Period 14 and to let the OR engine size orders to the new regime, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=13 (Periods 14\u201326) so the (1+L)\xd7mean is driven by the most relevant high-demand data. Demand volatility also rose with the regime shift, so I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=13 to capture recent variability. These choices steer the backend to target inventory appropriate to the higher recent demand while avoiding overstock from older low-demand periods; with profit=holding, service-level target is moderate (q=0.5), so emphasizing recent mean/volatility helps balance fill rate vs. holding cost given our low pipeline and current on-hand position.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 14 (higher avg demand since P14). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet current high-regime demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded messages (orders placed each period arrived same period); use promised/default lead time = 0. For demand forecast I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14\u201327) to capture the elevated mean and volatility: choose recent_N with N=14 (Periods 14\u201327 inclusive) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps the (1+L)\xd7mean tied closely to the realized higher demand and scales safety stock to the recent volatility. Profit and holding costs are equal ($1/$1) so the backend will target roughly the mean demand (service vs holding balanced); using recent regime estimates prevents under-ordering during this sustained higher-demand period. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift beyond the confirmed 0-period lead time, so no explicit lead-time adjustment is needed.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 context: on-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show same-period arrivals (lead time observed 0 across many periods), and demand shifted up starting at Period 14 (sustained higher demand from Periods 14\u201328). With promised lead time = 0 and confirmed same-period arrivals historically, I keep L at the default (promised) value so the OR backend assumes 0. For demand forecast I target the recent high-demand regime (Periods 14\u201328). I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=15 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the 15 most recent samples that reflect the new regime; this raises the base-stock to meet the higher sales level and reduce lost sales. For sigma_hat I also choose recent_N with N=15 so safety stock reflects volatility observed in the same recent regime. Given profit = holding, the backend will set a quantile of 0.5; using recent regime statistics focuses inventory where service level matters most while avoiding excess stock from older low-demand periods. Finally, on-hand + pipeline (4 units) is far below recent-period mean demand (~180), so these parameters will drive orders to replenish to the regime-appropriate base stock.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time of 0 periods (all concluded lead_time=0), and there is a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period_14 (higher mean from Period_14 onward). Given zero pipeline and immediate demand exposure this period, I set L using calculated observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time=0. For demand forecasting I use a recent_N approach with N=16 (Periods 14\u201329) because the changepoint at Period_14 produced a sustained higher-demand regime; N=16 equals the regime length (capped rules applied). Using recent demand samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock target on the current higher-demand regime, improving service (reducing lost sales) while sigma_hat from the same recent window captures current volatility so the z* safety stock balances profit vs. holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period across the history), so using promised/default lead time is appropriate. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 14 (higher mean from Periods 14\u201330). To capture the post-changepoint demand level I use a recent_N forecast for demand (covering the recent regime). I choose N=17 (Periods 14\u201330 inclusive = 17 periods) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine's base-stock reflects the higher recent mean and volatility while still using the accurate L=0. This balances service level (avoiding frequent stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost by basing safety stock on recent variability rather than diluting it with older, lower-demand samples.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 14 (Periods 14\u201331 consistently higher than Periods 1\u201313). Current on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we have no coverage for upcoming demand. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals through Period 31 confirm actual lead time = 0 (no evidence of delays). Because the demand regime shifted up and has persisted for many periods (Period 14\u201331, length 18), I bias forecasts to the post-shift data. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 (use the last 18 periods after the confirmed regime change). This focuses the base-stock target on the current higher-demand mean and its volatility, improving service (reduce lost sales) while avoiding excess inventory based on older low-demand periods. With profit=holding, the backend will target a 50% critical ratio; using recent demand statistics keeps that target calibrated to the new regime and minimizes unnecessary holding cost given equal profit and holding per unit.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. History shows confirmed zero actual lead time (orders in prior periods always arrived same period) and no in-transit inventory now; on-hand = 33. There is a clear, sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 14 with higher demand since then (user-provided insight). Recent periods (P14\u2013P32) exhibit substantially higher mean demand than P1\u2013P13, so forecasting should emphasize the post-shift regime. No shipments are overdue or missing. Promised lead time = 0 and past confirms same-period arrivals, so use the default lead time. For demand forecast I select a recent_N window covering the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14\u201332, 19 samples) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean and avoids dilution by the earlier low-demand regime. I also use recent_N for sigma_hat (same N=19) to capture the recent volatility. This yields a base-stock roughly equal to the recent (1+L)-period mean (z* = 0 because profit=holding -> q=0.5), which prioritizes matching higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding cost by not blending in the old low-demand data. With on-hand=33 and no pipeline, the OR backend will compute order = min(base_stock \u2212 pipeline, cap) so these parameters help balance service (meet current elevated demand) against holding cost (avoid overstating demand by including pre-shift samples).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 start. On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly since Period 4). A sustained demand regime shift occurred at Period 14 (higher mean thereafter). To keep service during the elevated-demand regime, I use the promised/default lead time (0) and base demand estimates on recent periods rather than the long-run mixture. I select recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 periods to capture the post-Period-14 higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. This raises base_stock and safety stock relative to the full-sample average, reducing stockouts under current high demand while accepting higher holding cost given profit and holding cost parity.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period), and there was a sustained demand regime shift upward starting at Period 14 (higher average demand since then). With no inventory or pipeline, we must restock to cover the elevated recent demand. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0-period actual lead time. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 15\u201334 provide ~20 most recent high-demand samples) so the forecast reflects the higher mean demand; this avoids dilution by much lower pre-shift samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=20 to capture recent volatility and ensure the safety-stock term reflects current variability. These choices push the OR backend to target a base stock appropriate for the new, sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost awareness via the backend's q calculation.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 decision. All concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period consistently). Current on-hand = 0 and in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to cover immediate period demand. Recent demand has permanently shifted higher (regime shift at Period 14) and the most recent 20 periods show sustained elevated demand (periods 16\u201335 average well above early-period levels). To capture the current demand regime I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the latest 20 samples (this makes the base-stock reflect current high demand and recent volatility). I set L by calculation from observed lead times (will confirm as 0). This combination balances service (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand/in-transit and high recent demand) against holding cost by using recent volatility rather than overly large all-time buffers.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201336) consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0 (e.g., many 'arrived ... lead_time was 0 periods'), so actual lead time is confirmed at 0. Demand history shows a sustained regime increase beginning Period 14 (pre-14 average \u224893; Periods 14\u201336 average \u2248162+), so forecasts should reflect the higher demand level. Given zero pipeline and immediate arrivals (L=0), use the backend's calculation of L from observed lead times to lock to 0, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using the full sample set (which captures the regime shift in the historical data). This balances service (meeting the higher, sustained demand) against holding cost by letting the backend compute the base-stock using profit/(profit+holding)=0.5; using full-sample statistics is appropriate because the demand shift is already visible and sustained in the history. No overdue shipments or unexplained losses are present.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 decision. Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 periods (confirmed earlier). A sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 14 (mean increased materially) and has persisted; recent periods show elevated demand with occasional spikes (most recent single-period spike at Period 37 to 369, but that spike is not yet a 3+ period sustained change). There are no overdue or missing shipments to reconcile. Given confirmed lead time = 0, and the long-running higher-demand regime (Periods 14\u201337, regime length 24), I select parameters that focus the OR backend on the recent high-demand regime while limiting inventory risk from a single-period extreme spike. Choices: L kept at default (promised lead time = 0, confirmed); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 (cap per rules: use up to 20 most recent samples from the current regime) so the forecast reflects the sustained higher-demand period while smoothing single-period outliers. This balances service level (avoid frequent stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost sensitivity (profit=holding so target service quantile is 50%), letting the OR engine compute base_stock and the capped order. If the extreme 369 demand repeats for 3+ periods I will switch to a shorter EWMA or explicit higher mu in future periods.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods including Period 4 and all subsequent concludes show same-period arrivals). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 14 (sustained higher weekly demand). To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I use the promised/default lead time so the OR backend assumes L=0. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate to capture the post-shift regime: use the most recent 20 concluded demand observations to compute (1+L)*mean for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)*std for sigma_hat. Choosing N=20 (capped at 20) focuses the estimate on the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility, which helps the backend size base stock to meet demand spikes while limiting unnecessary extra inventory given zero lead time.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier at Period 4 and every conclude since), so I will trust promised lead time. Demand appears to have experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 14 (documented in game history / carry-over). Using a recent-window demand estimate avoids diluting the higher post-change demand with older low-demand samples. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so the OR backend's target service quantile is ~0.5 (low risk buffer); I still supply safety stock via the recent demand variance estimate. Therefore: L=default (use promised 0); mu_hat computed from the most recent regime using recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term spikes; sigma_hat also set to recent_N N=20 so the volatility estimate reflects the post-change variability (including recent large spikes). This choice ensures orders target the new higher mean demand and the variability observed since Period 14, while avoiding overweighting older low-demand data. It also responds to current inventory (zero) by driving the OR engine to replenish to the recalculated base-stock appropriate for the new regime.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. On-hand = 44, in-transit = 0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many periods), and there was a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 14 to a much higher demand level. Pipeline is empty so on-hand must cover current-period demand after decision. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms zero lead time. For forecasting I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the most recent sustained high-demand regime data. Evidence: demand rose and stayed higher from Period 14 onward (Periods 14\u201340 = 27 periods); to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing variability I choose N=20 (regime_length capped at 20). This makes mu_hat reflect (1+L)*mean of the last 20 demand observations and sigma_hat reflect sqrt(1+L)*std of the last 20, so the OR backend will target base-stock appropriate for the higher regime and compute safety stock from recent volatility. That balances service (avoid frequent stockouts given current higher demand) against holding cost by using recent observed variance rather than overly large long-run volatility.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 decision. On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (confirmed earlier around Period_14) and large variability in the most recent five demands: [369,214,271,172,164] (Periods 37\u201341). I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the current regime and short memory given volatility. With promised lead time = 0 and both profit and holding cost = $1 (q\u22480.5, z*\u22480), the OR backend will effectively target roughly the (1+L)-period demand mean; using recent_N avoids diluting the elevated recent mean by older low-demand periods. I choose N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat because the most recent five periods clearly reflect the current elevated regime and provide a balance between responsiveness and noise. This keeps base-stock focused on current demand while the sigma estimate captures recent volatility so the backend cap/buffer limits excessive orders. No outstanding arrivals to reconcile; on-hand 51 must cover part of this period's demand after ordering.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. On-hand = 63, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning at Period 14; recent periods show much higher demand (many periods of 150\u2013270+). With no pipeline and only 7 periods left in the horizon (periods up to 50), I prioritize avoiding stockouts while controlling holding cost. I therefore keep L at default (promised 0, consistent with observed arrivals). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-change higher-demand regime while smoothing over short-term spikes; this gives the OR engine an up-to-date (1+L)-scaled mean. For volatility I also use recent_N N=20 so safety stock reflects recent demand variability. These settings steer the backend toward higher base stock appropriate to the sustained higher-demand regime while using recent data to avoid overreacting to single extreme spikes.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44 context: on-hand=44, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical conclude messages consistently confirm lead time=0 (sustained evidence across many periods). Recent demand has been elevated compared with early periods (sustained higher regime since Period_14), but the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full observed demand history. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit each) so the backend's critical ratio is 0.5; using the backend defaults lets it compute the statistically appropriate base-stock and cap given observed demand and confirmed lead time=0. No overdue or lost shipments are visible (in-transit=0 and recent concludes show on-time arrivals). Therefore I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the full historical demand statistics and the confirmed promised lead time to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (many concluded arrivals same-period), so I trust promised lead time = 0. Demand exhibits a sustained upward regime starting around Period_14 (noted in carry-over): recent periods remain elevated compared with early-sample mean. To make the OR engine responsive to the current high-demand regime I bias forecasting towards the most recent observations. Therefore: L=default (use promised 0); mu_hat: recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent 5 demand outcomes and reflect the current higher-demand regime; sigma_hat: recent_N with N=5 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This increases target base-stock to maintain service when demand is elevated while keeping variability estimate aligned to recent fluctuations so the capped order cap remains reasonable. No overdue shipments are visible (arrived in all concluded periods), so no explicit lead-time correction is required.

Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period_14 (documented earlier); recent demand since that changepoint is the best predictor going forward. I therefore set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (capture the most recent regime: Periods 14\u201345 provide a long, sustained higher-demand regime; cap N at 20 per rules). Using recent_N focuses the OR engine on the post-changepoint higher mean and recent volatility, which helps the backend compute a base-stock level that balances service (avoiding stockouts in the higher-demand regime) against holding cost. Because profit=holding, the OR z* is 0 and the resulting base_stock will be driven by the chosen mu_hat; using the recent 20 periods reduces bias from earlier low-demand periods while still smoothing over short-term noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 decision. Current on-hand = 63, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded lead times consistently show arrivals same period (many concluded messages with lead_time=0), so actual lead time = 0 is well supported. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 14; recent periods remain in that higher-demand regime. Because lead time is 0, the OR backend expects mu_hat and sigma_hat calculated over the review+lead window = 1 period. To reflect the persistent higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise, I use recent_N=20 (captures the most recent 20 demand samples within the high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This biases forecasts toward current elevated demand and increases inventory targets compared with using all-sample averages, reducing expected stockouts given current on-hand=63 and no pipeline. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures safety stock reflects recent volatility. L is left as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 0-period actual lead time (orders arriving same period) and a sustained demand regime increase that began around Period_14. Recent realized demands (Periods 29\u201347) are substantially higher than early periods; the most recent 20-period window reflects the higher-demand regime and current variability. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently confirms 0 lead time. For demand level I choose recent_N with N=20 so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 20 samples (captures the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting lookback to a recent, relevant window). For volatility I also choose recent_N with N=20 so sigma_hat reflects recent variability (helps the OR engine set safety stock appropriate to current demand swings). These choices prioritize meeting service (avoid lost sales in this higher-demand regime) while allowing the OR backend's capped order limit to control extreme ordering and holding cost exposure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $205.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 decision. On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (confirmed in history repeatedly and noted in carry-over). Recent demand is substantially above the early-sample baseline (many periods since Period 14 show a sustained higher-demand regime). Current recent demands (Periods ~40\u201348) average roughly in the 170\u2013210 range, so I bias the forecast toward the recent regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages repeatedly confirm same-period arrivals. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise; this produces a (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std that better match current consumption and will reduce stockouts versus using the long-run mean. Using recent_N also keeps inventory levels from exploding because the OR backend still caps orders via its cap formula. This choice balances service (avoid lost sales in high regime) against holding cost by targeting recent realized demand and its variability.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (many periods) consistently show arrived shipments in the same period they were ordered, confirming actual lead time = 0. A demand regime shift was previously detected at Period 14 (sustained higher mean thereafter). To protect service levels while avoiding excessive holding cost (profit = holding cost \u2192 q=0.5, so z*\u22480), I anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat on the recent post-shift regime. Choices: L uses the default (promised lead time 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 periods; mu_hat uses recent_N with N=20 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the sustained higher-demand regime and follows the rule N = min(regime_length,20)); sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. With z*\u22480 the backend will set base-stock \u2248 mu_hat; using recent post-shift data keeps orders aligned with the higher demand while sigma_hat from recent data prevents under-ordering in high-variance windows. No in-transit stock means the order will need to cover current period demand as well.
