Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence available, on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so there are no overdue shipments to reconcile. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [88,148,80,84,103] (mean=100.6, std\u224824.94). Promised lead time is 0 and with no contradictory evidence I use default lead time. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine will compute demand across the review+lead period as (1+L)*mean(all samples) and volatility as sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (using the full-sample mean and variance) against holding cost given the high unit profit relative to holding cost. If future conclude messages show delayed or lost shipments or a sustained demand shift, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit method.

=== Period 1 Summary ===

Daily Reward (R_t): $1833.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period: Period_2. Context: chips(Regular) has on-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrival shows the Period 1 order (147 units) arrived with lead_time=0 (ordered on Period 1, arrived same period) and Period 1 demand sold=99. The provided historical demand samples (Period_1..5) show no clear sustained shift; recent realized demand (99) is slightly above the provided sample mean but is a single-period deviation. There are no overdue or missing shipments to signal longer lead time. Therefore I use the promised/default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with supplier promise (L: default). For demand and volatility I select default methods so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This is conservative: it leverages all available samples to smooth single-period noise while keeping pipeline targets consistent with confirmed lead-time behavior, balancing service level (through base-stock computed from full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost given the low holding cost ($1/unit) relative to profit ($19/unit).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. Observed on-hand=42, in-transit=0. Concluded history (P1,P2) shows orders placed arrived same period (arrived=147 on P1 for order on P1; arrived=94 on P2 for order on P2) \u2014 evidence so far supports actual lead time = 0. Historical demand samples (used for forecasting): [88, 148, 80, 84, 103], mean = 100.6, sample std \u2248 27.9. Profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1 \u21d2 critical fractile q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 (z\u22481.645). I choose to let the OR backend use its standard formulas based on observed lead time (calculate L) and the full-sample demand stats (default mu_hat and sigma_hat). With L=0 the backend will compute mu_hat \u2248 (1+0)*100.6 = 100.6 and sigma_hat \u2248 sqrt(1+0)*27.9 \u2248 27.9, yielding a base-stock around 100.6 + 1.645*27.9 \u2248 146.5. This policy balances high service level (q=0.95) appropriate given high profit relative to holding cost, while current on-hand (42) plus any new order will be evaluated by the engine against pipeline to decide replenishment. I do not record a carry-over insight yet because lead-time evidence has only 2 periods; require >=3 for a sustained confirmation.

Daily Profit: $1881.00, Daily Holding Cost: $39.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1842.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Current on-hand=39, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived same period (observed lead_times = 0,0,0). Recent realized demand (from concluded periods) is stable: 99, 100, 99. Given high unit profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1), we should prioritize service (higher target fill rate) and use recent demand to reflect the most current regime. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 concluded demand samples (N=3) so the forecast captures the current stable demand level and immediate variability; the OR backend will scale these by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L). This approach keeps safety stock reasonable given high profit-to-holding ratio while avoiding overstating demand from older, potentially irrelevant samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2->P2, P3->P3)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1919.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 start. Last conclude messages (Periods 1-4) confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders placed previously arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this period; we must cover Period 5 demand plus ongoing service. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean 100.6 and std \u224824.95. Given confirmed lead time 0, use the backend defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L = promised (0). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock target centered on the full-sample mean (no recent regime detected) while relying on its built-in z* tradeoff between profit ($19) and holding cost ($1). Using defaults avoids overreacting to normal variability and leverages the confirmed 0-period lead time to keep orders arriving same period they are placed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1666.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: on-hand=44, in-transit=0, recent concluded demands (Periods 1\u20135) = [88,148,80,84,103] with sample mean = 100.6. Carry-over history already confirmed actual lead time = 0 (arrivals in P1\u2013P5 matched same-period orders). No overdue or missing shipments visible. Expected single-period demand \u2248100.6; with profit $19 and holding $1 the critical service quantile q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95, implying the OR engine will favor high service levels. Given stable demand samples (no sustained changepoint of 3+ periods with a different mean/variance) and confirmed lead time=0, I choose the default/statistics-over-all-samples options so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This keeps the forecast anchored to the full recent history while allowing the backend to compute the high service-level base-stock (appropriate given high profit relative to holding cost). No explicit adjustments are needed because arrivals have been reliable and on-hand inventory (44) is well below the single-period mean demand, so the OR policy will likely replenish to meet the high service target.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2489.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over). Recent demand has increased in Period 6 (131) vs prior periods (104, 90), suggesting a possible upward shift but not yet sustained for 3+ periods. Given zero observed lead time and a need to avoid stockouts for a high-profit SKU (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 high critical fractile), I choose to keep lead time = promised (default) and set demand forecast using the most recent short window to capture the higher recent demand. I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 3 concluded demand observations: Periods 4-6) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N captures the recent volatility. This balances service (high profit) against holding cost (low relative), and also responds quickly to the upward demand indication without overcommitting to a long-term regime change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1277.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 start: on-hand=72, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demand (Periods 1-7) averages ~99.1 units/period with high variance (std ~16.5). Past conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed previously). There are no overdue or in-transit arrivals to expect this period. Given confirmed same-period arrivals and no evidence of recent sustained regime change in demand (mixed high/low but not a 3+ period stable shift), I select L=default to use the promised lead time (0) consistent with concluded evidence. For demand forecast and uncertainty I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from the full sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively). This keeps the OR engine anchored to the full observed demand distribution (captures the recent high demand spike in P6 but not overreacting), and balances service-level targeting (higher profit vs holding cost) while avoiding overordering given current on-hand stock and zero in-transit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2005.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: on-hand=28, in-transit=0, recent concluded history (Periods 1-8) shows every order arrived in same period it was placed. Carry-over previously recorded confirmed lead time = 0. Demand in recent periods (Periods 4-8: 104, 90, 131, 71, 107) averages ~100.6 with noticeable variability. Given consistent evidence of 0-period actual lead time and no overdue shipments, I set L via calculation of observed lead times to let the backend confirm (average of observed lead times = 0). For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime reflected in Periods 4-8; mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean of those 5 recent demands, keeping the forecast responsive to the recent mean (~100.6 units). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine computes sigma_hat from the same recent sample set (captures recent variability, std ~19.8). This combination keeps the base-stock tied to current realized lead time (0) and to the recent demand regime, balancing service level (profit $19) against holding cost ($1) by relying on recent demand evidence rather than older samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2082.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 start. On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u20139) consistently show arrivals with lead_time=0; carry-over insight from Period 4 previously confirmed lead time=0. Recent demand has been higher and more variable than the early five-sample seed: last 5 demands (Periods 5\u20139) = [90,131,71,107,111], mean = 102 units, showing the current demand regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period delivery. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime (N=5 is within the guidance and uses the most recent stable window). This increases responsiveness to the observed higher recent mean while reflecting current volatility so the OR backend's base-stock will balance the high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) by targeting service with appropriately sized safety stock based on recent variance rather than the older low-demand samples. With on-hand=27 and zero in-transit, this will prompt the OR engine to order toward the recent-demand-informed base stock to avoid stockouts this period (remember arrivals occur same-period), while the lower holding cost limits excessive overstock.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 context: on-hand=9, in-transit=0, recent demand has averaged ~104.3 units/period (Periods 1-10 demands = 99,100,99,104,90,131,71,107,111,131). Carry-over history confirms actual lead time = 0 periods (multiple conclude messages showing same-period arrivals). No evidence of lost shipments. With promised lead time = 0 and confirmed actual lead time = 0, I choose default methods so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This keeps mu_hat anchored to the full-sample mean (~104.3) and sigma_hat to full-sample volatility, balancing service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost. Given low on-hand and zero in-transit, the OR engine will raise orders toward the base stock implied by profit/holding tradeoff while respecting its cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1842.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 context: recent realized demand (Periods 7-11 = 71, 107, 111, 131, 99) averages ~103.8 units/period with moderate volatility (~19.5). On-hand = 39, in-transit = 0, no overdue shipments visible. Promised lead time = 0 and prior carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 0 (orders have consistently arrived same period). To balance high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), I use a short recent-window demand estimate to adapt to the more recent regime (Periods 7-11) rather than older data. Therefore: L set to default (promised = 0) since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)*mean of last 5 periods (captures current demand level ~103.8); sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility (~19.5). These parameters give the OR backend an updated base-stock reflecting current demand while keeping safety stock aligned to recent variability, limiting excess holding cost given low holding penalty.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201312) consistently shows orders arriving in the same period they were placed (lead_time=0 each concluded period). On-hand=28, in-transit=0 so available inventory before arrivals this period = 28; no overdue shipments. Demand history exhibits variable but stable weekly demand \u2192 use conservative/default grounding so OR backend uses full historical mean/variance. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, giving a balanced base-stock that reflects long-run demand variability and the high profit-to-holding cost ratio (profit $19 vs holding $1) to favor service. This choice avoids overfitting short-term noise and responds appropriately to confirmed zero lead time and current on-hand inventory.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 summary: on-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u201313 show every order arrived same period (lead_time=0 confirmed). Demand history (Periods 1\u201313) average \u2248105 units and std \u224815.9. Profit/holding ratio implies high service target (q=19/(19+1)=0.95 \u2192 high z*), so keep lead time at promised 0 to allow the OR backend to compute base_stock using the full-sample mean and variance. I choose default methods: L=default because concluded history confirms lead time = 0 and there is no evidence of lost shipments; mu_hat=default to use the full-sample mean across all observed demand ((1+L)\xd7mean); sigma_hat=default to use the full-sample volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances the high service level implied by profit vs. holding cost while relying on the complete demand history and confirmed same-period arrivals.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: recent history shows consistently observed lead_time = 0 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0). On-hand is low (8) and in-transit is 0, so we risk a stockout this period if demand stays near recent levels. Demand over the last several periods has been elevated vs the very early samples (recent demands P10\u2013P14 = 131, 99, 112, 113, 128 -> mean \u2248 116.6), so I bias the forecast toward the recent regime. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals across many periods confirm same-period delivery. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the higher recent mean and avoid under-ordering. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine increases safety stock reflecting recent volatility. These choices increase service level now (reducing stockout risk given only 8 on-hand and no pipeline) while keeping holding costs in check by using a short recent window rather than inflating variance with older quieter periods.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 context: on-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u201315 all show lead_time=0 (orders placed in Pn arrived in Pn), so actual lead time is consistently 0. No overdue or lost shipments visible. Demand context: recent concluded demands fluctuate but no sustained regime shift detected. Profit=$19 vs holding=$1 implies a very high critical fractile (q\u22480.95) so the optimizer will target high service. I set L via 'calculate' to reflect the observed lead-time history (0). I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical demand samples \u2014 this is appropriate because no significant demand changepoint is evident and same-period arrivals mean current-period demand should be covered heavily. This balances high service (due to high profit) against holding cost by letting the backend compute the base-stock and cap using full-sample statistics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2603.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent history shows one large isolated demand spike (Period 16 demand=280) but prior periods are in the ~70\u2013140 range; that spike appears one-off and not a sustained regime change. No overdue or missing shipments to flag. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I choose default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L); this is conservative given the single-period spike and avoids overreacting to a one-off event. These choices give the OR engine a balanced base-stock target: service level driven by profit vs holding cost while avoiding oversized orders due to a transient spike.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201317) consistently show orders arriving same period (lead_time = 0 each concluded period), and recent large demands (Periods 16\u201317: 280, 289) appear as short spikes rather than a sustained regime shift. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed repeatedly by concluded arrivals, so I use the default (promised) lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with observed behavior. Demand history shows variability, but no sustained (>3 periods) increase in mean that would justify switching to a recent_N or EWMA forecast; therefore I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using the full sample set. This balances service level (using the confirmed short lead time) against holding cost, avoiding overreaction to the two-period spike which could otherwise inflate safety stock unnecessarily.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show promised lead time = 0 confirmed (carry-over insight). Recent demand has shifted sharply: Periods 16-18 demands = [280, 289, 280], previously Periods 1-15 average demand \u2248 106.6. This is a sustained spike (3 consecutive periods) so I detect a new higher-demand regime starting Period 16. To capture the higher short-term demand while keeping parameters simple and consistent with confirmed LT=0, I set L to default (promised 0). For demand sizing I use recent_N (N=3) to have mu_hat reflect the new regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). For risk I also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects the observed volatility in the high-demand regime. This choice makes the OR backend's base_stock and cap responsive to the higher recent mean and observed variability, improving service during the spike while still leveraging the confirmed zero lead time. No evidence of lost shipments to adjust lead time further.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg increased from 106.6 (Periods 1-15) to 283.0 (Periods 16-18), +165% (sustained 3 periods).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 context: on-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent observations P1->P1 through P19->P19). Demand shifted up starting Period 16 and has stayed high (demands P16\u2013P19 = 280, 289, 280, 264). Because the high-demand regime appears sustained (4 periods), I use a recent-window forecast to capture the new mean and volatility rather than the older low-demand data. Choices: L=default to rely on confirmed 0-period actual lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=4 to set (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 4 demand samples (captures the new demand regime); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=4 to reflect the recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet the sustained high demand while keeping safety stock sized to recent variability, balancing service (avoiding stockouts) against holding cost given low holding cost ($1/unit).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained evidence through Period 20). Demand has shifted higher starting Period 16 (sustained through Periods 16\u201320), so we must keep a high target to avoid stockouts. Given confirmed lead time = 0 and the OR backend formula (base stock uses profit/(profit+holding) \u2192 high service quantile \u22480.95), I will use default methods so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the full sample history (which includes the recent high-demand regime). This keeps ordering driven by the observed elevated demand while letting the OR's cap and z* trade off profit vs holding cost automatically. Using defaults is conservative and avoids overfitting to short noise while respecting the confirmed lead-time=0 and recent sustained demand increase.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: on-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show lead time consistently 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period_16: recent demands (Periods 16-21) = [280, 289, 280, 264, 322, 203], clearly higher than pre-Period_16 average. I therefore keep L at default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=6 (the recent high-demand regime length) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 6 samples, capturing the new elevated mean while avoiding dilution by low historical demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect the volatility observed in the new regime. These choices give the OR engine a demand estimate aligned with the confirmed higher-demand regime, ensuring orders cover the current elevated demand while the 0 lead time avoids extra pipeline. This balances high profit per unit (profit=19 vs holding=1) by favoring service (larger mu_hat) but using recent volatility to limit excessive safety stock.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 context: recent history confirms a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 (Periods 16\u201322 demand samples range ~203\u2013336 with average ~283 over 16\u201318 and continued elevated demands through P22). Promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals through Period 22 show actual lead time = 0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Current inventory: on-hand = 2, in-transit = 0 \u2014 effectively no coverage for upcoming demand. Given the clear, sustained regime shift to higher demand, I bias the demand forecast to recent data rather than the long-run sample. I choose L = default to trust the promised lead time (supported by concluded arrivals). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select recent_N with N = 7 (Periods 16\u201322) to capture the new regime's mean and volatility: this keeps the OR backend\u2019s base_stock tuned to the higher demand and raises safety stock appropriately. This approach increases orders now to avoid stockouts in the high-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check by using a recent-sample-based volatility rather than the long-run larger sample. No overdue shipments detected, so no explicit lead-time inflation is needed.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24: recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 16 (higher-demand regime). I use that higher-demand regime for forecasts. Current on-hand = 71, in-transit = 0; next-period expected demand under the new regime is ~282 units, so current inventory is well below expected demand and we should target the new regime mean. L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time. mu_hat uses recent_N from the detected regime (Periods 16-23, 8 periods) so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean of the last 8 samples (~282). sigma_hat uses recent_N with the same N=8 to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices keep service levels high during the sustained higher-demand regime while holding costs remain low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1), so the backend's base-stock calculation will prioritize filling pipeline to meet the elevated demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 decision. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (Periods 16\u201324 mean demand ~285.7, vs pre-period-16 mean ~106.6). Current on-hand = 33, in-transit = 0 \u2014 insufficient versus the new higher demand level (one-period demand now ~285 units). No overdue shipments detected; lead time observations through Period 24 consistently show 0 periods. To keep the OR engine focused on the elevated demand regime while respecting confirmed lead-time behavior, I set L to the promised/default (0). For demand parameters I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 16\u201324) because the changepoint at Period 16 is clear and sustained (regime length = 9); this ensures mu_hat reflects the new, higher average demand (~285.7 per period) and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. These choices push the backend's base-stock up to meet the new demand spike while the confirmed L=0 avoids overcompensating for lead-time risk.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 start. On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Profit=$19, Holding=$1 -> high critical fractile (q=0.95) so OR will target a high service level. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning Period 16 (confirmed earlier); recent demands (Periods 16-25) are all elevated versus Periods 1-15. No evidence of lead-time slips or lost shipments (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Therefore I keep L at the promised/default (0). For demand location and scale I focus on the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N with N=10 (covering Periods 16-25) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean over the last 10 periods and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. With on-hand+pipeline = 0 we must replenish to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand; picking recent_N keeps orders responsive to the confirmed regime shift while avoiding contamination from the low-demand pre-Period-16 history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4649.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 start. On-hand=120, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (multiple periods: P1->P1 ... P26->P26), so using promised lead time is supported. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift beginning Period 16 (higher mean sustained through most recent periods). To reflect the elevated demand regime I use a recent-window forecast rather than the full-sample mean so the OR backend sets a higher base-stock (improving service given high profit $19 vs holding $1). I select recent_N with N=11 (Periods 16\u201326 inclusive) because the recent high-demand regime length is 11 periods; N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) = 11. Using recent demand for both mu_hat and sigma_hat increases the mean forecast (and estimated volatility) over the full-sample values, which raises the base-stock and the safety-stock appropriately given high profit margin while keeping holding cost in mind. L left as default (promised 0) because concluded arrival messages confirm lead time 0.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 16 (large, persistent jumps in demand through Period 27). On-hand = 69, in-transit = 0; with lead time 0 arrivals would be immediate (but none are currently in-transit). I retain promised/default lead time because concluded history robustly confirms lead time = 0 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=0). To capture the post-Period-16 higher-demand regime I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=12 (Periods 16\u201327 inclusive: regime length = 12). This focuses the forecast and volatility estimate on the elevated demand regime and reduces understock risk. Using recent_N for sigma_hat raises safety stock to reflect current variability. These choices guide the OR engine to a higher base stock (service-focused) while the capped order cap limits excessive orders and holding cost exposure; with holding cost low relative to profit ($1 vs $19) prioritizing service is appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6236.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 context: on-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (confirmed across many periods), and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 with substantially higher mean demand (~~280+ recent). Recent periods (P16\u2013P28) show high and variable demand, so I anchor forecasts to this higher regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently confirms 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=13 (the regime from Period 16\u201328 has 13 periods) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most relevant post-changepoint samples. This focuses ordering on the new higher-demand regime, reducing stockouts while avoiding excess holding given holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19, holding $1). With on-hand=34 and no in-transit, these parameters will raise the base-stock to cover the elevated demand while the capped order limit prevents extreme single-period orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4774.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 context: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (concluded arrivals each period matched orders), and demand shifted up around Period 16 and has remained elevated. Current inventory: on-hand=109, in-transit=0. Recent periods (16\u201329) show substantially higher weekly demand than Periods 1\u201315, so using the recent elevated regime will produce a more appropriate forecast. I select L=default to respect the promised lead time of 0 (confirmed historically). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=14 (regime from Period 16 through Period 29 \u2014 length 14); this captures the sustained high-demand regime while staying within the recent_N rules. Using recent demand for both mean and volatility ensures the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet the higher expected demand while sigma_hat reflects recent variability. This balances high service level (profit-driven q ~ 0.95) against holding cost by avoiding pulling the long-run low-demand mean into the forecast, which would under-stock during this sustained high-demand regime. Also note on-hand + in-transit = 109, so if the OR engine increases orders based on the elevated recent mean, we expect to rebuild safety stock to reduce lost sales during this high-demand period.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31 context: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (concluded arrivals P1->P1 ... P30->P30), on-hand = 101, in-transit = 0. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 16 (higher demand). Since that changepoint, demand has remained at the elevated level through Period 30 (Periods 16-30 = 15 samples). I therefore set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded messages confirm same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16-30). This focuses the OR backend forecast on the higher recent mean and variance rather than diluting it with the earlier low-demand periods. That increases the base_stock to better cover elevated demand while the capped order limit still restrains extreme ordering. Using recent_N for sigma_hat ensures safety stock reflects the realized higher variability in the new regime. No new sustained lead-time or demand changes beyond the Period-16 shift were detected, so no carry-over insight update is recorded.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5961.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime that began at Period 16 (average demand jumped dramatically and has stayed elevated). Current on-hand = 43, in-transit = 0 so available supply is low versus the elevated demand environment; no overdue shipments are visible. Promised lead time has consistently been observed as 0 (arrivals have matched orders same period in concluded history), so I keep L as default to reflect promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=16 (covering Periods 17\u201332, the most recent 16 observations) so the OR backend forecasts demand and volatility based on the elevated regime rather than the long tail of lower pre-shift data. This raises the base-stock target (mu_hat) to help avoid stockouts given current low on-hand and zero in-transit, while using recent variance (sigma_hat) preserves appropriate safety stock for the higher variability. With Profit=$19 and Holding=$1, the backend will compute a service-level target; my parameters bias that target toward higher availability to maximize profit from sales while accepting measured holding cost from higher on-hand levels.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for all concluded periods (P1->P1 through P32->P32). A sustained demand regime shift occurred beginning Period 16 (higher mean sustained through Period 32). To protect service with promised L=0, I set L to default. For demand forecasting I use a recent_N estimate that focuses on the post-changepoint high-demand regime: regime runs from Period 16 to Period 32 (17 periods), so I choose N=17 to capture current mean demand behavior. Using recent_N for sigma_hat with N=17 captures recent volatility rather than diluting with low-demand earlier periods. These choices raise base_stock to reflect the higher recent mean while using recent volatility to size safety stock, trading off higher profit from sales against modest holding cost (holding cost is only $1 vs profit $19).

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 16 (carry-over insight). All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (many concluded messages with lead_time 0), so using the promised/default lead time is appropriate. Current on-hand = 72, in-transit = 0; with lead time 0, any order placed this period will arrive during this period's arrivals step (but visibility follows conclude). To capture the post-Period-16 high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples from that regime. I use recent_N with N = 18 (Periods 16\u201333) because the regime length is 18 periods; this follows the N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) rule and focuses forecasting on the current elevated demand level while excluding the lower-demand pre-Period-16 data. This raises the base-stock target to better meet service levels given Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1 (high profit\u2192higher service target), while the recent_N sigma captures current volatility to size safety stock appropriately. Given on-hand=72 and no pipeline, these parameters will prompt the OR engine to order toward a higher base stock to avoid stockouts during this sustained high-demand regime while limiting excessive holding through using recent volatility rather than overly conservative all-time estimates.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Recent history shows actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly through Period 34). Demand experienced a sustained, large upward regime shift starting at Period 16 (previously recorded). Current inventory: on-hand=74, in-transit=0 so available now for Period 35 demand is 74; no arrivals will be visible until next conclude. Because the high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201334) is sustained (~19 periods), I use a recent_N demand estimate focused on that regime to avoid under-ordering. Choices: L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (consistent with all concluded arrivals); mu_hat=recent_N with N=19 to set (1+L)\xd7mean based on the 19-period high-demand regime (captures the new higher average demand and reduces stockouts); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=19 to capture the volatility in the same recent regime. This combination directs the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while using observed recent variability to size safety stock; keeping L at default avoids inflating pipeline due to no evidence of lead-time drift, which helps limit holding cost given holding=$1/unit/period.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 16 (confirmed earlier): average demand rose substantially and has persisted through Period 35. Current inventory: on-hand=96, in-transit=0 \u2014 no shipments outstanding. Given confirmed zero actual lead time historically and the sustained higher-demand regime, I keep L at the default (promised lead time = 0). For demand sizing I use a recent-window estimate to capture the post-change regime: use the last 20 demand samples (Periods 16\u201335) so mu_hat reflects the higher mean over the current regime. Similarly use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat so the OR engine estimates volatility from the same regime. These choices ensure base_stock targets the elevated mean demand while sigma is informed by current variability, balancing the high profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1) to avoid stockouts in the new regime. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift is present (arrivals have consistently concluded same-period).

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 16 (documented in prior carry-over). Current on-hand=22, in-transit=0 \u2014 low cover vs. elevated demand (recent demands often 250-380 range). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). To align the forecast with the higher demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, averaging variability from the most recent regime. I select N=20 (capped at 20) to capture the last ~20 periods of elevated demand (gives stable mean and std while focusing on the new regime). These parameters will raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the higher mean and ensure the backend's service-level z* (driven by profit vs holding cost) is applied to the regime-relevant volatility. This balances higher stock needs to avoid lost sales against holding costs given high profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4868.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38. Context: Profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit \u2192 high service emphasis (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95) so target fill-rate is high. On-hand=110, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed at 0 (multiple periods); no evidence of lost shipments. Demand regime: a sustained higher-demand regime began at Period 16 (previously recorded). To reflect the current elevated demand level and recent variability, I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent data within the high-demand regime. Choice details: L set to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 periods actual lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (the high-demand regime runs from Period 16 onward; regime length available \u224822 periods, capped to 20) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the last 20 demand samples. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while letting the backend compute the z* driven by the high profit/low holding cost ratio. This approach balances service (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than diluting forecasts with older low-demand samples. I expect the orders computed from these parameters will replenish on-hand quickly (lead time 0) and maintain high fill rates with modest extra inventory given the high profit-to-holding-cost ratio.

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 context: on-hand=142, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods (confirmed repeatedly through Period 38). Demand regime shifted up at Period 16 and has persisted since (much higher average demand vs. Periods 1-15). To ensure the OR backend targets the current higher-demand regime, I focus the demand forecast on the most recent regime rather than the full-sample mean. Therefore: L set to default (use promised lead time = 0, consistent with concluded history). mu_hat set using recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained post-Period-16 regime (20 most recent samples emphasizes current demand level and smooths short-term noise). sigma_hat set using recent_N with N=20 to estimate volatility under the same recent regime. This approach keeps target base-stock aligned to the higher demand while limiting overreaction to short fluctuations; with lead time = 0 the policy will order to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand using the recent-regime mean and variance, balancing service level (profit per unit high) against holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 (previous carry-over noted). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period). Current on-hand = 108, in-transit = 0. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded data confirm it, so I keep L as default (use promised 0). For demand forecasting I select the backend defaults: mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This leverages the full historical sample to compute base_stock and the capped order cap; with profit/holding giving a high service quantile (q\u22480.95), the OR engine will target a high base-stock to protect service in the sustained high-demand regime while the cap prevents extreme single-period orders. Keeping defaults is appropriate because lead time is stable at 0 and the demand regime shift has already been recorded in carry-over insights, so the backend can use the full-sample statistics to set base_stock and the cap accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4187.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 context: demand has been at a higher regime since Period 16 (sustained for 25 periods through Period 40). Current on-hand = 145, in-transit = 0. Promised lead time = 0 and concluded history (many Period X conclude lines) confirms actual lead time = 0 consistently, so no lead-time elongation or lost shipments to hedge against. Given the sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 16, using all-sample averages would under-forecast; I therefore base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime. I choose L = default to keep promised lead time (confirmed = 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N = 20 (regime length since Period 16 is 25 periods; per rules N = min(regime_length,20) \u2192 20) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 20 demand samples. This biases the base-stock toward the higher recent mean (improves service and units_sold) while the OR backend's cap will limit extreme orders to control holding cost. With on-hand = 145 and no in-transit, this approach raises the target pipeline to meet the elevated demand while avoiding overstating variability from older low-demand periods.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42. On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (avg ~283 for P16-18 and sustained higher demand thereafter). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history, so use promised lead time. To reflect the higher, persistent demand regime I use recent-N statistics (focus on the most recent data) so the backend's base-stock and cap reflect current elevated demand while limiting excess holding. Methods chosen: L=default to keep lead time=0 (confirmed historically); mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime using the last 20 demand samples (balances service level to profit/$19 vs holding cost $1); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 so safety stock reflects recent volatility rather than older low-demand periods. This keeps orders responsive to the new higher-demand regime and avoids understocking given no in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5229.00

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43 context: on-hand=91, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0 (many period conclusions with arrived=ordered on same period), and a sustained demand regime shift began at Period_16 (noted in carry-over). Recent demand since Period16 is materially higher than earlier periods. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms same-period arrival. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 24\u201343 encompass the most recent 20 samples within the elevated-demand regime). This gives the OR engine (1+L)*mean over the most recent 20 demands so base stock reflects the higher steady demand rather than being pulled down by pre-shift low demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=20) so the safety stock accounts for the current higher variability. With profit=19 and holding=1 the backend will compute the z* service level; using recent regime stats reduces stockouts while avoiding excess holding from older low-demand periods. Operationally, on-hand(91)+in-transit(0) will be compared against the pipeline target; selecting recent_N prevents under-ordering given the elevated demand.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals in history consistently show lead_time=0 (P1->P1 through P43->P43), so default lead time is appropriate. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting at Period 16 (higher mean since P16). To keep the forecast responsive to the post-shift regime while smoothing noise, I use a recent_N approach based on the most recent data from the higher-demand regime. Regime length since Period 16 is large (Periods 16\u201343), so I cap the recent window at 20 periods to focus the forecast on current demand patterns. Using recent_N for mu_hat gives the OR engine an updated (1+L)\xd7mean over the latest high-demand periods; using recent_N for sigma_hat captures current volatility. This balances high service (profit per unit is large relative to holding cost, q \u2248 0.95) against holding cost by letting the OR backend compute a high target service z while basing demand and uncertainty on recent post-shift data. Current on-hand=63 and in-transit=0; the chosen parameters will drive orders to replenish to the new regime's base stock while avoiding excessive long-tail safety stock from older low-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5352.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 context: profit=$19/unit and holding=$1/unit/period imply a high service quantile (q=0.95). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (many periods confirming orders arrived same period). A demand regime shift occurred at Period_16 (mean rose from ~106.6 to ~283) and high demand has persisted since; recent periods (Periods 26-44) show sustained high weekly demand ~230-375. On-hand is 82 with 0 in-transit, so we are currently short relative to current high-demand regime. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and prioritize service given high profit relative to holding cost, I select L=default (use promised lead time 0) and use recent data to estimate demand: apply recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine's base-stock and cap reflect the last 20 periods of observed high demand. This increases target inventory to avoid stockouts while the low lead time keeps holding exposure minimal. Using recent_N helps the backend adapt to the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping variance estimate aligned to recent volatility.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 context: on-hand=95, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders in prior periods arrived same period), so promised lead time remains valid. A sustained demand regime shift occurred starting Period 16 (higher demand since then), so recent high-demand behavior should drive the forecast. To capture the current regime I use recent_N with N=20 (the last 20 demand periods) for both mean and volatility; N=20 is chosen because the post-changepoint regime length is large (Periods 16\u201345) and we cap N at 20 per rules. With L = default (0), mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 20 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(last 20 samples). This focuses the OR backend on the elevated demand regime and keeps pipeline short since lead time = 0, balancing service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by using recent volatility to size the safety component.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5346.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 context: on-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show orders arriving same period (many entries with 'lead_time was 0 periods'), so actual lead time remains 0. Profit/holding implies a very high service target (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95) so the OR engine will choose a high base-stock; using the backend defaults lets it compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the full sample set to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, leveraging the long demand history and the confirmed L=0. Because there are no overdue or in-transit shipments to reconcile, and no new sustained demand or lead-time shifts in the last periods, I use default methods so the OR engine balances service level (capture high profit) against holding cost automatically. If shortages begin to appear next period despite L=0, I will consider recent_N or explicit adjustments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5842.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 context: profit = $19/unit, holding = $1/unit/period. Current visible inventory: on-hand 67, in-transit 0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201347) consistently show arrivals with lead_time = 0 (e.g., P1->P1 ... P47->P47), so promised lead time = 0 is reliable. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting at Period 16 (higher mean from P16 onward); this higher-demand regime persists through the most recent periods. To capture the post-changepoint behavior while smoothing short-term noise, I use the most recent 20 demand samples to set demand forecast and volatility (N chosen per policy: regime length since Period 16 is >20, so N = 20). This provides the OR backend with (1+L)-period demand estimates focused on the current high-demand regime, improving service-level (reducing stockouts) while keeping excess inventory in check given relatively low holding cost. Using default lead time (promised 0) avoids overestimating pipeline when concluded arrivals confirm same-period delivery.

Daily Profit: $4332.00, Daily Holding Cost: $127.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $4205.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49 context: demand has been in the higher regime since Period 16 (sustained). On-hand=127, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 in earlier carry-over; I therefore use the default lead time so arrivals will be treated as same-period by the backend. Profit $19 vs holding $1 => service quantile q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 (high service target). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility, selecting N=20: the post-changepoint regime runs from Period 16 onward (33 periods), so per the rule N = min(regime_length,20) = 20. This focuses forecasts on the elevated demand pattern while keeping variance estimation recent. With L=default (0) the backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 20 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 20 samples), producing a base-stock aligned with a high service level while avoiding overweighting distant low-demand history. Given on-hand=127 and zero in-transit, this setup will prompt replenishment to restore the higher target inventory needed to meet the elevated demand regime while keeping holding cost considerations via the backend's z* calculation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5268.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50. Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period_16 (sustained high demand through Period_49). On-hand = 71, in-transit = 0; there are no overdue or missing arrivals in concluded history. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time = 0 (orders arriving same period). Profit/holding tradeoff: profit $19 vs holding $1 implies a very high critical fractile (~0.95) so the OR engine will target a high service level; to keep parameters simple and consistent with the confirmed zero lead time and long history, I use the default historical-demand-based estimates so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps forecasts anchored to the full history (including the sustained post-Period_16 regime) and lets the backend apply its capped ordering cap to avoid excessive orders while achieving the high service level implied by profit/holding.
