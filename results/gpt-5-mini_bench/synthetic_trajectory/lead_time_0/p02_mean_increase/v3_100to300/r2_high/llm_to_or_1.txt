Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals observed (first period). Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show mean \u2248100.6 units and std \u224827.9 units. Promised lead time is 0 and there is no evidence to adjust it. I choose default methods so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This provides a baseline base-stock that balances the high profit ($19) against holding cost ($1) using the backend's service-level formula. With no observed delays or regime shifts, default (all-sample) estimates are appropriate for Period 1 while we collect arrival/conclude signals for future lead-time inference.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2533.00

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 decision. Current on-hand=13, in-transit=0. From Period_1 conclude we observed an order placed in Period_1 arrived in Period_1 (arrived=147, lead_time observed=0), so there is no evidence the actual lead time differs from the promised 0. Demand history is limited (only one concluded period observed in this run), and the preloaded sample series will be used by the OR engine for estimation. Profit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), implying a high target service level; I therefore use the default lead time and default demand estimates so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples and applies the base-stock formula. This balances the high penalty for lost sales against holding costs while remaining conservative given only a single concluded period of live feedback and no sustained regime change.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1427.00

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 context: on-hand=74, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead times: orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 BOTH arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 for each), so no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Demand context: historical sample set (provided) has mean demand \u2248100.6 units/period and std \u224824.95. On-hand (74) is below the expected single-period demand, so we should replenish to cover expected demand while balancing holding cost. Lead time choice: use calculated average of observed lead times (0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. Forecast choice: use default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to anchor to the full-sample demand estimate (1+0)*100.6 \u2248100.6; no sustained changepoint in demand (only two recent periods with mixed sold volumes), so full-sample mean is appropriate. Volatility choice: use default sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u224824.95 to reflect overall demand variability. These parameter choices give the OR backend an honest estimate of demand and low lead time so it will target a high service level (profit >> holding cost) without needlessly inflating safety stock given no evidence of shipment delays.

Daily Profit: $2356.00, Daily Holding Cost: $25.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2331.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision: on-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived in the same period (lead_time=0 each). No overdue shipments visible. Demand history (available samples) has mean ~100.6 and std ~24.95. Promised lead time is 0; concluded evidence (3 consecutive periods) confirms actual lead time = 0. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), the service-level target implied by q = profit/(profit+holding) = 19/20 = 0.95 is high, so we want the backend to target a high base-stock. I therefore set L via calculate (average of observed lead times = 0) and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat to the backend defaults so it uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances using all available demand history (robust estimate) while the confirmed zero lead time lets the OR engine compute a single-period forecast and a relatively tight safety stock given observed variability. No signs of lost shipments or regime shift yet, so no explicit adjustments to mu/sigma.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2590.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-4) shows consistent same-period arrivals and the provided carry-over insight already confirmed actual lead time = 0. Current on-hand = 13, in-transit = 0. Historical demand samples: [88,148,80,84,103] (mean \u2248100.6). There is no sustained demand regime shift in the last 5 periods (volatility is driven by one higher sample in Period 2), so I will use the default statistical aggregation to let the OR engine compute the base-stock target from the full sample set. Choosing L=default uses the promised lead time (0), mu_hat=default uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, and sigma_hat=default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps ordering conservative given current modest on-hand inventory (13) and no in-transit stock, relying on the backend's capped ordering logic to balance the high unit profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1). If upcoming periods show systematic change (3+ periods) in mean or volatility or any delayed/missing arrivals, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit method.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1586.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 6. Promised lead time is 0 and prior concluded arrivals in Periods 1-5 confirm actual lead time = 0. On-hand = 67, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand (from Periods 1-5 concludes) = [134, 79, 124, 137, 87], mean = 112.2 and sample volatility justifies using the most recent regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded data shows same-period arrivals. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of the last 5 observed demands (captures the current realized demand level ~112 units for the review+lead period). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 so volatility is estimated from the same recent window. Rationale vs. missing shipments: there are no overdue or missing shipments (arrivals have concluded each period), so no lead-time inflation or safety-stock padding is required beyond what the OR backend computes from recent demand. This approach balances service (using recent higher mean like 112) against holding cost by relying on the capped ordering policy and recent-sample volatility rather than an explicit upward adjustment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1883.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 decision. Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P6) shows on-hand=55, in-transit=0, and six observed demands: 134, 79, 124, 137, 87, 102 (mean \u2248 110). All past orders have arrived same period confirming lead time=0 in prior insight. No shipments are overdue or missing now (in-transit=0). I select L=default to use the promised lead time (0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. For demand sizing I choose mu_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, leveraging the full sample set given moderate variability and no sustained regime change. For uncertainty I choose sigma_hat=default so the backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. These choices keep the base-stock anchored to the historical average demand (\u2248110 per period) while using observed variability to determine safety stock; with lead time 0 this balances service (high profit $19/unit favors higher q) against the modest holding cost $1/unit by letting the OR engine compute the appropriate z* and cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $812.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 8. Recent concluded history shows arrivals every period with lead time 0 (P1->P1 ... P7->P7), so actual lead time matches promised 0. On-hand = 100, in-transit = 0; recent demand has averaged ~101.6 units/period (Periods 1-7) with notable variability (low in Period 7 = 48). Given confirmed same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost or delayed shipments, use the backend defaults which use all historical samples and promised lead time. This keeps the OR engine anchored to the full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) and avoids overreacting to the single low demand in Period 7. With high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) the backend's fill-rate-optimal z will drive orders toward service; using defaults balances service and holding cost given the confirmed L=0 and current on-hand position.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: on-hand=64, in-transit=0. Recent realized demands (P1-P8) average ~99.6 units/period with noticeable variability (range 48\u2013137) but no sustained upward or downward shift. All concluded arrivals through Period 8 show lead time = 0, consistent with the promised lead time. There are no overdue or missing shipments to account for. Given confirmed same-period arrivals and no clear demand regime change, use the environment defaults so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by letting the backend set safety stock via its q = profit/(profit+holding) calculation while avoiding manual overstocking when on-hand is already 64 units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $773.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 decision. History shows 9 concluded periods with demand: [134,79,124,137,87,102,48,86,46]. On-hand=101, in-transit=0. Carry-over from Period 4 confirmed actual lead time = 0; recent arrivals in every conclude continue to support same-period fulfillment (no missing shipments). Sample mean demand over the 9 concluded periods \u2248 93.7 units/period and sample std \u2248 33.9. Given the confirmed lead time=0, stable arrivals, and no sustained regime shift (demand has variability but no 3+ period sustained change upward or downward), I choose to use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base-stock using all historical samples: L default to promised lead time (0), mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean(all samples) (uses full-sample mean \u224893.7), and sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) (uses full-sample std \u224833.9). This keeps decisions grounded in the full sample while the high on-hand (101) relative to mean demand suggests no urgent replenishment is required this period. Using defaults balances service level (profit is high) against holding cost by letting the OR backend compute the appropriate z* and cap from the full-sample statistics.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 context: on-hand=89, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (Periods 1\u201310) average ~90.2 units/period with moderate variability; promised lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over insight (orders have consistently arrived same period). Profit per unit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) implies a very high target service quantile (q = 19/(19+1)=0.95) so the OR backend will aim for a high fill rate but holding cost is low relative to profit. Reconciliation: on-hand 89 is essentially one period of expected demand (~90), so we do not need to inflate forecast; with L=0 orders arrive same period (as observed historically). Given stable demand and confirmed 0 lead time, I select default methods so the backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) plus its safety-stock using the profit/holding ratio. This balances service level (high q) against low holding cost and avoids over-ordering when on-hand already covers one period of demand.

Recent demand samples (Periods 1-11 shown historically; core historical series Periods 1-5 provided earlier) show stable demand with occasional variability. Profit per unit ($19) vs holding ($1) implies a high critical fractile (q=19/20=0.95) and therefore the OR engine will target a high service level; to support that without overfitting short-term noise I select default methods that use the full sample set. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples\u2014this leverages full historical statistics and lets the OR engine compute the high safety stock warranted by the high profit margin. Inventory reconciliation: with 33 on-hand and no in-transit, ordering will be needed if backend base_stock minus pipeline indicates replenishment; using defaults ensures the backend accounts for observed demand mean/variance and high service target. No evidence of lost shipments or sustained demand regime change requiring explicit overrides.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 decision. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201312) shows all orders arriving same period (arrived reported for orders placed that period), confirming actual lead time = 0. Current on-hand = 78, in-transit = 0. Historical demand (Periods 1\u201312) has mean = 90.25 units/period and no sustained regime change or seasonal event visible; variance is moderate with fluctuations but no 3+ period sustained shift. Given stable confirmed lead time (0) and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments, I select default methods so the OR backend uses full-sample statistics: L=default (promised lead time), mu_hat=default to set base stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) (\u224890.25), and sigma_hat=default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding overreacting to short transient demand swings. Note: on-hand (78) is slightly below the long-run one-period mean (~90), so the OR engine will likely place an order to refill toward the base stock.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14 context: on-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demand (Periods 1\u201313) averages ~92 units/period with high variability; all prior concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over). No sustained demand regime shift evident (recent fluctuations but not 3+ periods of consistent change). Given profit $19 >> holding $1, we favor service (higher fill) but must be conservative because on-hand is already 26 and there are no in-transit units. I select default methods so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std to compute base stock and cap, relying on the backend's statistical safety-stock formula. This balances high profit (drives higher target fill) against the modest holding cost, while respecting observed lead time=0 and current lack of pipeline inventory.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 decision. History shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed earlier and repeatedly observed through Period 14 conclude). Current state: on-hand=41, in-transit=0. Recent demand history (Periods 1\u201314) is variable but centered around roughly 80\u2013120 units with some lower dips; no sustained change in mean/variance over the last several periods that would justify altering the default forecast. Because promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals have confirmed 0 lead time, I use the backend defaults so it computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample set and the known lead time. This keeps the policy stable, lets the OR engine compute the base-stock and cap using all available data, and avoids overfitting short fluctuations. With on-hand=41 and no pipeline, the backend will determine the order needed to reach the computed base stock balancing high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2376.00

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 context: confirmed stable zero lead time across concluded periods (orders from P1\u2013P15 all arrived same period). On-hand is low (18) with no in-transit stock. Historical demand samples (provided) have mean \u2248100.6 units/period and std \u224824.95. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded evidence supports using L=0. I select default methods so the OR engine uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples: with L=0 this implies mu_hat \u2248100.6 and sigma_hat \u224824.95. Given profit $19 and holding $1, the critical fractile q = 19/(19+1)=0.95 (z\u22481.645), producing a base-stock around 100.6 + 1.645\xb724.95 \u2248 142 units. With on-hand 18 and no pipeline, the engine will place an order roughly equal to that gap (\u2248124 units) subject to its cap. This choice balances high service level (profit far exceeds holding cost) while using the confirmed zero lead time and full-sample demand estimates. No evidence of sustained demand regime shift or lost shipments beyond the previously recorded insight.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201316) consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Recent demand sequence shows one large spike (Period 16 demand=368) but it is a one-period outlier; no sustained regime change in mean/variance across the last 16 concluded periods. Given on-hand=0 and promised/observed lead time 0, we must replenish immediately to cover the current period's demand (decision precedes demand). I therefore use a lead time estimate computed from observed lead times (calculate) and default demand/volatility settings so the OR backend uses the full sample mean and std (1+L factor applied internally). This balances service (protects against regular demand variability) while avoiding overreacting to the single-period spike which is not yet a sustained shift. If future periods show multiple high-demand periods, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit forecast.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows reliable same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 in concluded periods) and a large but brief demand spike at Periods 16\u201317 (368,297) that is not yet a sustained regime change. Given confirmed 0 lead time and no sustained demand shift (needs \u22653 periods), I use the backend defaults so it computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set. This lets the OR engine apply its capped base-stock policy using the proven lead-time and the full-sample demand statistics, balancing the high per-unit profit ($19) against the low holding cost ($1) without overreacting to a short-lived spike.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead times = 0 for all concluded orders through Period 18). Recent demand exhibits a clear upward regime beginning at Period 16 (demands: P16=368, P17=297, P18=251) versus prior periods (typically <140). With no pipeline and a short/confirmed lead time, I prioritize protecting service against the new high-demand regime. Therefore: set L by calculation from observed lead times (will confirm 0); set mu_hat using a recent_N=3 forecast to capture the sustained high-demand regime (uses periods 16\u201318 average across the review+lead window); set sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These parameters increase target base stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent samples informs safety stock to balance profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3137.00

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20 context: on-hand=226, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Concluded history (Periods 1\u201319) shows every order arriving same period (lead_time=0) including recent large demands in Periods 16\u201319 (368, 297, 251, 177). This indicates a sustained, higher-demand regime starting Period 16. Because there are no units in-transit, new orders must cover current-period demand as arrivals occur same period. To make the OR backend responsive to the elevated demand regime while keeping holding costs in check, I set L to default (use promised lead time=0, which is confirmed by concluded arrivals) and use recent_N for demand parameters focusing on the post-changepoint window. Specifically, I use the last 4 periods (Periods 16\u201319) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock and safety stock reflect the new, higher mean and observed variability. This choice reduces stockouts under the new regime while avoiding excessive safety stock driven by older, low-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased from ~95.4 (Periods 1\u201315) to ~273.3 (Periods 16\u201319), +186%; sustained for 4 periods

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 context: recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 16 (demands in Periods 16\u201320 = 368, 297, 251, 177, 356; mean \u2248 289.8). On-hand = 50, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is low relative to the new demand level (one-period demand \u2248 290). Prior carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 0 (orders have arrived same period). I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) to reflect confirmed fast replenishment. For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=5 (the new regime length = 5 periods, N = max(min(5,20),3) = 5) so mu_hat will target (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 samples \u2248 289.8. Volatility has shifted with the regime, so sigma_hat also uses recent_N with N=5 to capture current std. These choices ensure the OR backend raises the base stock to cover the higher recent mean demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock; keeping L=default avoids inflating pipeline need given confirmed 0 lead time. This addresses missing shipments (none observed) and balances service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding costs by relying on recent high-demand data rather than long-term averages.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: confirmed same-period arrivals historically (lead time observed = 0). Recent demand regime shifted up starting Period 16 (large, sustained increases). Current on-hand = 93, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. To capture the higher recent demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive, I use the promised lead time (default = 0) and compute demand forecast and volatility from the recent high-demand regime. I detect the changepoint at Period 16 and use the last 6 post-changepoint samples (Periods 16\u201321) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6) so the OR backend bases base_stock on the elevated mean and recent variability. This balances higher service level needed after the demand jump against holding cost by focusing on recent data rather than the long historical low-demand periods.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 decision. On-hand=141, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show every order from Periods 1\u201322 arrived same period, so actual lead time = 0 confirmed. Demand regime changed at Period 16 (sustained higher demand); recent demands (Periods 16\u201322) = [368,297,251,177,356,327,274] indicating a new higher mean and material variability. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (will be 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (the length of the confirmed high-demand regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new regime: this focuses the base-stock on the current higher mean and recent variability, reducing stockouts during sustained elevated demand while avoiding overstating older low-demand periods. Using recent_N volatility helps the OR backend size safety stock appropriately given the higher variability, balancing profit-driven service level against holding cost.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 context: on-hand=42, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201323) consistently show arrivals same-period (lead_time=0 each concluded arrival), so actual lead time remains confirmed at 0. Demand regime shifted up starting Period_16 (large sustained increase through Period_23). I treat the recent high-demand regime as the relevant forecast window. For L I use default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=8: the recent regime spans Periods 16\u201323 (8 periods) and is the best evidence for current expected demand; using these 8 samples lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent high-demand periods so base_stock reflects the new regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=8 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices keep inventory targets responsive to the sustained higher demand while leveraging confirmed lead-time=0 to avoid overordering for pipeline. This balances the high profit ($19) against the modest holding cost ($1) by sizing safety stock to recent demand volatility rather than the lower pre-shift mean.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 context: on-hand=234, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-time observations (P1\u2013P24) consistently show actual lead time = 0; recent arrivals have all concluded same-period. Demand regime shifted up at Period 16 and has remained elevated through Period 24 (sustained for 9 periods). Given confirmed same-period arrivals, use promised/default lead time = 0. For demand forecasting, focus on the post-change regime: use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 16\u201324) so mu_hat reflects the higher sustained demand rather than the lower pre-Period-16 mean. Use the same recent_N (N=9) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This choice keeps base-stock driven by current high-demand regime (reducing stockouts) while leveraging the confirmed 0 lead time to avoid overcovering multiple periods. High profit vs holding (profit $19 vs holding $1) implies a high service target; the OR backend will compute z accordingly. The selected parameters balance service level (by using recent high-demand mean and volatility) against holding cost given ample on-hand inventory and 0 lead time.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: on-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (multiple periods). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16; the last 10 concluded demands (Periods 16\u201325) are: [368,297,251,177,356,327,274,360,176,394], mean \u2248 298 units/period. With lead time = 0 the review+lead horizon = 1 period, so target demand across review+lead \u2248 1\xd7mean. To avoid stockouts given sustained high demand and no pipeline, I set mu_hat based on the most recent 10 samples (recent_N, N=10) to capture the new regime. I also set sigma_hat based on the same recent window (recent_N, N=10) to reflect current volatility. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm same-period delivery. These choices push the OR engine to target inventory sized for the elevated demand regime while sigma_hat from recent data helps size safety stock appropriately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4414.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: confirmed fast deliveries (lead time observed = 0 in concluded messages) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 (historical record shows large, persistent increases in demand: Periods 16\u201326 consistently well above pre-16 levels). Current on-hand = 184, in-transit = 0. With promised lead time = 0 and concluded history confirming 0, there's no hidden pipeline to rely on this period, so the order placed now would arrive within the same period. Demand regime evidence: average demand pre-Period16 \u2248 95.4 (Periods 1\u201315) vs. post-Period16 \u2248 273.3 (Periods 16\u201319) and continued high demands through Period 26 (Periods 16\u201326 form an 11-period high regime). To capture the current high-demand regime and keep service while controlling holding cost, I set: L = default (use promised lead time 0 because concluded messages confirm 0); mu_hat = recent_N with N = 11 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean using the most recent regime data (N=11 matches the length of the sustained high-demand regime since Period 16); sigma_hat = recent_N with N = 11 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. Using recent_N for both mean and volatility focuses the base-stock target on the confirmed higher demand, while L=default keeps the OR engine aware that replenishment is same-period. This balances high profit per unit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by sizing orders to recent elevated demand rather than the lower long-run mean.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6842.00

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Profit = $19/unit, Holding = $1/unit/period (high service target). Historical conclude messages consistently show arrived orders same period (lead_time = 0 observed repeatedly through Period 27), so I use the promised/default lead time. Demand jumped and stayed higher starting around Period 16 (recorded in prior carry-over), but that regime shift is already documented; to keep parameters consistent and let the OR engine apply its full-sample estimates (which incorporate that sustained higher-demand history), I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples. This balances maintaining service (high profit vs holding cost tradeoff) while avoiding overfitting short-term noise. No overdue shipments are visible (no in-transit units), so no explicit lead-time correction is needed now.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6264.00

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 decision. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period_16 (multiple periods of ~250\u2013400 demand); current on-hand=25, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods in the concluded history (Period 1\u201328 arrivals matched orders same period). Because the demand regime shift at Period_16 is sustained (13 periods from P16\u2013P28), I use recent_N for demand estimates to focus the forecast on the new higher-mean regime. I keep L = default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 actual lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=13 (use the last 13 demand samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant regime; this concentrates stock to meet higher expected demand while avoiding over-weighting older low-demand periods. This balances service level (profit $19/unit motivates higher fill rate) versus holding cost ($1/unit) by basing the base-stock on the recent high-demand mean and its volatility.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30 start: on-hand=100, in-transit=0. Historical conclude records (Periods 1\u201329) confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple confirms through Period 4 and ongoing). Demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning at Period_16 (large jump sustained through recent periods). To keep service during this elevated-demand regime, I base demand forecast on the recent high-demand regime rather than the long-run mixed series. Therefore: L set to default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with confirmed observations. mu_hat uses recent_N over the recent high-demand regime to capture the elevated mean (N=14 covers Periods 16\u201329). sigma_hat uses recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base_stock to meet elevated demand while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the OR engine's q formula; using recent samples avoids diluting the current demand level with older low-demand data.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 context: on-hand=189, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201330) consistently show arrivals in same period \u2192 actual lead time confirmed 0. Demand regime shifted up at Period 16 and has remained elevated through Period 30 (sustained higher demand); recent periods still show high sales. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I use recent data from the post-change regime. L: use default (promised 0). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=15 to capture the elevated mean demand from Period 16\u201330 ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 15 samples). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=15 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=178, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed in earlier periods); no delayed or lost shipments visible. Demand regime shifted up starting Period_16 and has persisted through Period_31 (sustained high demand ~200\u2013370). To make the OR backend responsive to the higher-demand regime, I use a recent_N approach for demand mean and volatility, focusing on the post-changepoint window. Chosen L=default to trust promised lead time of 0 (supported by concluded arrivals). mu_hat: recent_N with N=16 (uses last 16 periods of demand, i.e., Periods 16\u201331) to capture elevated average demand across the review+lead window (1+L). sigma_hat: recent_N with N=16 to reflect recent volatility after the regime shift. These choices increase target base stock to maintain service during sustained high demand while sigma_hat from the same window informs safety stock; keeping L=default avoids artificially stretching pipeline when shipments have been reliably same-period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5472.00

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 33. On-hand = 114, in-transit = 0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201332) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), and prior carry-over already recorded that. There was a clear, sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 16 (noted previously): pre-Period16 mean ~95.4, post-Period16 mean much higher. Recent realized demand from Periods 16\u201332 remains elevated, so I base forecast on the recent high-demand regime. To capture this sustained higher mean while keeping volatility appropriate, I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, selecting N equal to the recent regime length (Periods 16\u201332 = 17 periods). I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. Using recent_N focuses the OR engine on the current high-demand regime so base_stock increases to meet service targets; sigma_hat recent_N reflects current volatility to size safety stock without over-investing in holding costs.

Current on-hand = 119, in-transit = 0, so there is no pipeline cover for upcoming demand. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u201333); therefore I keep L as default to let the OR engine assume the promised 0-period lead time. For demand I use a recent_N approach focused on the post-changepoint regime: the shift at Period 16 is sustained, so I base mu_hat on the most recent 18 periods (Periods 16\u201333) to capture the new, higher mean demand. The sigma_hat is set with the same recent_N=18 to reflect volatility observed in the recent high-demand regime. These choices prioritize service in the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR backend compute base_stock and cap using updated mean and volatility over the correct regime. Given on-hand=119 and no in-transit, using recent-regime estimates increases order targets to reduce stockouts under the new demand level while sigma_hat-inflation captures variability to avoid frequent underordering.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 context: on-hand=216, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201334) confirm actual lead time = 0 consistently and a sustained demand regime shift starting at Period 16 (much higher mean demand since then). Given the confirmed same-period arrivals, I use the promised/default lead time. For demand forecast I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201334) because that regime (19 periods) is sustained and materially higher than Periods 1\u201315; this avoids pulling the mean down with older low-demand periods. I choose recent_N for mu_hat to have the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean over the recent high-demand regime, and recent_N for sigma_hat so variability is estimated from the same recent window. These choices steer the OR engine to a base-stock tuned to the current higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind; using recent data reduces stockouts from underforecasting the new regime while sigma_hat from the same window prevents underestimating variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5800.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 context: all concluded history (Periods 1\u201335) shows actual lead time consistently 0 (arrivals always in same period). There was a sustained demand regime change starting Period 16 (noted in carry-over): higher mean demand persists through the most recent periods (Periods 16\u201335, 20 periods). On-hand = 90, in-transit = 0; with lead time 0 we must cover only the current-period demand after ordering. To capture the higher, sustained post-Period-15 demand regime, I set L to the default promised lead time (0) because concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0. For demand sizing I use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the entire new regime (Periods 16\u201335) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to capture volatility in that same window. This increases target base stock to meet the higher average demand while sigma_hat (recent volatility) informs safety stock; together they help the OR backend balance service (high profit per unit) against holding cost by raising the forecast to avoid costly stockouts in the new high-demand regime while limiting overstock via an empirical recent volatility estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4742.00

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37 context: lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed earlier P1\u2013P36 arrivals). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period_16 (carry-over noted). Current inventory: on-hand=141, in-transit=0. Promised L=0 remains valid so set L method to default. To reflect the post-Period_16 high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates, selecting N=20 (regime from P16\u2192P36 is 21 periods; capped to 20 per rules) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent 20 demand observations (reduces dilution from the low-demand early periods). Using recent_N helps the OR backend produce a base-stock sized for the currently sustained higher mean and volatility, balancing high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) by targeting service during the high-demand regime. This also accounts for on-hand=141 and no in-transit: with L=0 the (1+L) review period is current period, so recent_N forecasts will drive ordering to replenish to the regime-appropriate base stock while avoiding unnecessary carry beyond the observed high-demand level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5751.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38 context: on-hand=82, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and many concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=0. Demand permanently shifted up at Period_16 (large jump from ~95 to ~273 sustained). I therefore keep L as default (promised=0) because concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead_time=0. For demand forecasting I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher sustained mean/variance: regime length since Period_16 through Period_37 is 22 periods, so I cap N at 20 per policy to get a stable recent estimate. Using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on the current high-demand regime, ensuring base_stock reflects elevated demand while sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given no in-transit) with holding cost by not relying on older low-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $6150.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 context: on-hand=63, in-transit=0, no arrivals pending. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 16 (noted earlier): demand increased markedly and has remained at the higher level through Period 38. Promised lead time is 0 and past concluded messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 0. To keep service during this higher-demand regime while limiting holding cost, I use recent demand statistics from the post-changepoint regime. Methods chosen: L='default' to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; mu_hat='recent_N' with N=20 and sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=20 to have the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 20 demand samples (captures the sustained high-demand regime and smooths short-term noise). Using recent_N focuses the base-stock on current, higher demand so the backend will target higher fill rates (appropriate given profit >> holding cost) while sigma_hat from the same window provides realistic safety-stock sizing.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40 decision. On-hand=95, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (many periods) consistently show orders arriving the same period (e.g., P1\u2192P1 through P39\u2192P39); actual lead time is confirmed as 0 \u2014 match promised lead time. A demand regime shift at Period 16 (noted in prior carry-over) produced a sustained higher-demand regime from Period 16 onward. To keep the OR engine responsive to the higher recent demand while avoiding excessive holding, I use: L=default (promised lead time=0) since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals; mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to base the review+lead demand forecast on the most recent ~20-period high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 so safety calculation reflects recent volatility. Profit $19 vs holding $1 yields a very high service quantile (q\u22480.95); using recent demand statistics prevents the backend from under-ordering in the sustained high-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N ensures safety stock is sized to recent variability. No overdue shipments are visible (in-transit=0), so no explicit lead-time inflation is needed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3589.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. On-hand = 192, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201340) consistently show arrivals in the same period they were ordered (observed lead_time = 0 each concluded period), so promised lead time = 0 is confirmed. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting at Period 16 (pre-shift avg ~95; post-shift observations much higher, often 200\u2013350). To reflect the higher recent mean and higher volatility I will base demand estimates on the most recent regime data. Because the regime has been sustained for many periods, I choose recent_N with N=20 (captures the last 20 demand samples, constrained by the policy N cap) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This raises the (1+L)*mean input used by the OR engine, increasing base_stock to prioritize service (profit per unit $19 >> holding cost $1) while still letting the OR engine cap orders. Using recent_N for sigma_hat also communicates the higher realized volatility so the backend increases safety stock accordingly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5334.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 start. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (multiple confirmations P1\u2192P1 through P41\u2192P41), and there are no overdue or missing arrivals visible (in-transit=0, on-hand=100). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period_16; recent demand (last 5 concluded periods P37\u2013P41 = 307, 327, 299, 199, 286) averages \u2248283.6. Given the sustained higher regime and recent variability, I use the promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current regime while keeping responsiveness. Using recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on the current elevated mean and recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock high enough to avoid stockouts during high demand but not excessively inflate holding costs, and it leverages the confirmed L=0 to let orders arrive same period if needed. Current on-hand (100) plus expected order will be compared by the OR engine against the base-stock and pipeline to decide order quantities.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 context: on-hand=135, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times for chips(Regular) are consistently 0 (many concluded messages show arrived same period as ordered). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 16 (much higher mean sustained through recent periods). Recent demand remains in the high regime, so I use recent data to forecast. L: use 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time (history shows 0). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (regime length since Period 16 is >20 periods; N capped at 20). This sets (1+L)*mean over the last 20 samples so the base stock reflects elevated demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. Rationale for choices vs. holding cost: using recent data raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts during this sustained high-demand regime (high profit per unit justifies higher service level), but keeping sigma estimated from recent volatility prevents overordering from an overestimated uncertainty; using calculate for L prevents mistakenly inflating lead time when concluded history shows 0 and there are no missing shipments to suggest delays.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 context: on-hand=167, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201343) show every order arrived same period (lead_time=0 consistently), and there are no overdue or missing shipments to suggest longer lead time. Demand has shifted earlier (noted at Period 20) but that sustained insight is already recorded; recent periods (31\u201343) show elevated mean demand relative to initial five-sample seed. I therefore set lead time to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm 0. For demand forecast and volatility I use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages the full demand history including the sustained higher regime and keeps the cap/stock calculations consistent. This balances service level (using full-sample stats reflecting the higher-demand regime) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory and zero in-transit.

Period 45. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 (previously recorded). Current on-hand=131, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this period. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so I keep L = default to let backend use promised lead time. Because profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1) we should target a high service level; to capture the post-changepoint, higher mean and current volatility I use recent_N (last 20 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend's base-stock and cap reflect the newer regime rather than long-past low-demand samples. This balances higher fill-rate (gain profit) against modest holding cost given the high unit profit. Using recent 20 periods also smooths short-term noise while reacting to the sustained regime shift. With on-hand=131 and no pipeline, the backend will compute orders to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the base-stock implied by the recent demand estimate and high service target.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period_16 (sustained high demand through Period_45). Current on-hand = 80, in-transit = 0 so available inventory is low relative to typical period demand (recent periods often sold 200\u2013330). Promised lead time = 0 and historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time = 0, so use default L to reflect promised lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand parameters: choose N=20 (recent regime length >20, capped at 20) so the OR backend will base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the last 20 demand samples (covering the sustained high-demand period). This raises the base-stock to protect service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). Using recent_N increases forecasted mean and measured volatility so the backend\u2019s capped order will better cover (1+L) periods of demand while the cap prevents extreme single-period overorders. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change in concluded history, so do not inflate lead time.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 context: on-hand=108, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 (historically confirmed as 0). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 16 (already recorded in carry-over), so I prioritize recent data rather than the long-ago low-demand samples. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead time 0. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples: Periods 27\u201346). N=20 follows the rule N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) since the high-demand regime length >20. This gives the OR engine a forecast focused on the sustained higher mean and recent variability, improving service (avoid stockouts) while still letting the backend cap order quantities to limit excess inventory and holding costs. No in-transit stock to cover the current period, so higher recent-based mu_hat helps ensure orders are sized to cover immediate demand with lead time 0.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 decision. Context: on-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (many periods where orders placed arrived same period), so promised L=0 is confirmed. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 16 (sustained increase noted in history), so I will let the OR engine compute base_stock using all observed demand samples to capture the full demand variability and regime. Using default L/mu/sigma lets the backend apply its analytic service-level formula (base_stock = mu_hat + z*\xb7sigma_hat) with q driven by profit=$19 and holding=$1. This balances high service level (to avoid lost sales given high profit) against holding cost. Given on-hand=40 and no in-transit, the engine will order up to the computed base stock; default sigma captures overall volatility. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift requiring explicit overrides.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5840.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 context: on-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0 (confirmed repeatedly in concludes), and demand has been in the elevated regime since Period_16 (~250\u2013310 recent). Recent demands (Periods 44\u201348) = [247, 290, 245, 313, 311], current short-term average ~281.2 units. With promised lead time 0 and no in-transit stock, the OR backend should target (1+L)\xd7recent mean to reflect the sustained high-demand regime while keeping holding cost in mind. I choose L='default' (use promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current elevated demand mean and short-term volatility (N=5 covers the most recent week of data and is above the minimum N=3). This biases the base-stock toward serving the high current demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand periods. No evidence of new lead-time or demand regime changes beyond those already recorded, so no new carry-over insight.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5983.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 50 context: confirmed historical actual lead time = 0 (from carry-over) and promised lead time is 0. On-hand = 21, in-transit = 0. Historical demand shows a clear, sustained high-demand regime beginning at Period 16 (large jump from ~95 to ~273 in earlier insight) \u2014 recent periods (16\u201349) consistently show much higher demand than Periods 1\u201315. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), the OR backend should target a relatively high service level (q = profit/(profit+holding) is large) and therefore use a larger safety stock. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the most recent 20 demand samples from the high regime. Choice of N: the regime since Period 16 is long (Periods 16\u201349 = 34 periods); per rules N = max(min(regime_length,20),3) \u2192 20. L is left as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms lead time = 0 and there is no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. This parameterization directs the OR engine to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most recent 20 samples, ensuring forecasts and safety stock reflect the sustained elevated demand while leveraging high profit to justify holding extra inventory. This should help the backend balance service level (avoid lost sales in this high-demand regime) versus holding costs. I observed on-hand 21 versus typical recent period demand in the hundreds, so the resulting order will likely be substantial to replenish to the computed base-stock.
