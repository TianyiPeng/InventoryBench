These two periods imply a stable short-run demand around ~99.5 units. The historical sample block in the instructions is general reference; the actionable data available to me are the conclude messages shown for Periods 1\u20132. c) Lead time / orders: Concluded messages for Periods 1 and 2 both show ordered arrivals same period (arrived=ordered, lead_time = 0). Thus actual lead time is confirmed as 0 periods (orders placed this decision phase will arrive during this period and be visible in the next period's conclude message). No missing or delayed shipments are observed. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. With lead_time=0, any order placed now can be used to satisfy Period 3 demand. e) Final order logic: Profit per sold unit = $1, holding cost per unit per period = $1. That implies symmetric overstock/understock penalties (critical ratio 0.5). With very recent realized demands of 99 and 100 (median ~99.5) and no strong evidence of a regime shift, ordering to cover expected demand is appropriate. To avoid lost sales while keeping overage risk minimal, I order 100 units (rounding to the nearer recent high).

No missing or delayed shipments observed. \n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. Because lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive during Period 7 and be available to satisfy Period 7 demand (but will only be visible in the Period 7 conclude message).

Recent 5-period demands: P38=230, P39=265, P40=228, P41=328, P42=280 \u2192 5-period average = 266.2. A slightly longer window (P32\u2013P42) shows many values around ~280\u2013320, so expected demand this period is roughly in the 265\u2013300 range; I use ~280 as a central forecast. c) Lead time / pipeline: Past concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). In-transit = 0, on-hand = 12. d) Inventory assessment: With lead time = 0, orders placed now will arrive in-period and can satisfy Period 43 demand. Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit, so carrying extra inventory into the next period effectively nullifies the profit for those units; therefore target ending inventory should be close to zero. e) Order logic: Aim to match expected demand this period while avoiding excess ending inventory. Forecast ~280 units demand; with 12 on-hand, order = 280 - 12 = 268 units to meet expected sales while minimizing leftover holding cost. If realized demand is lower, leftover inventory will incur high holding cost; if higher, missed sales forgo $1 profit per unit. This order balances those trade-offs given recent demand levels and equal profit/holding costs.",

Recent observed realizations when stock was sufficient: P46=285, P45=271, P48=228, multiple periods in the 280\u2013310 range.
