Per instructions, do not infer lead-time changes without concluded evidence. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0.

However orders can be delayed or lost\u2014no evidence yet. e) Final order logic: optimize expected reward where profit per sold unit = $4 and holding cost per unit/period = $1. Use critical ratio = 4/(4+1)=0.8 => target the 80th percentile of demand. Assuming approximately normal demand (mean=100.6, sd\u224827.9), 80th percentile \u2248 100.6 + 0.841*27.9 \u2248 124 units.

Recent conclude messages consistently show arrived = ordered each period, so shipments are reliable and not lost. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0. With lead time = 0, any order placed now will arrive in Period 14 before demand is realized and thus can satisfy Period 14 demand. e) Final order logic: Demand forecast for Period 14 = ~113 units (5-period recent average). Holding cost = $1/unit/period vs. profit = $4/unit implies some penalty for overstock but greater value in meeting demand (stockouts forfeit $4 profit per unit). To balance service and holding cost I target the recent mean demand with a slight rounding. Therefore I will order 113 units to match expected demand while avoiding excessive holding cost.",

I therefore place a sizable order to cover potential high demand this period while limiting excessive inventory risk. Ordering 260 units provides a strong chance to meet a high-demand outcome (covers up to ~260 sales).

Recent history (Periods 16 onward) shows a sustained, higher-demand regime vs. early periods, so treat demand as high and roughly stable around recent averages. b) Demand regime analysis: Use recent realized demand (P28=330, P29=257, P30=261). 3-period average = 282.7 units. The longer recent window (P25\u2013P30: 375,251,298,305,320,237 arrivals/demands) also centers ~297, but the most recent 3 periods average ~283\u2014so expected demand this period \u2248 280\u2013300 units. c) Lead time / arrivals: Historical conclude messages already confirmed actual lead time = 0 periods (arrivals in the same period as ordered). There is currently In-transit=0 and On-hand=39. Because lead_time=0, any order placed now will arrive before demand in Period_31 and therefore can be used to meet Period_31 demand. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand 39 is far below recent-period demand (~280). No in-transit coverage. Holding cost = $1/unit/period, profit = $4/unit sold. The marginal expected profit per additional unit sold is $4 minus expected holding cost if it remains unsold next period; but holding cost per period is modest relative to profit, so prioritize service (avoid lost sales) while being conservative with excess inventory. e) Final order logic: Target stocking to meet expected Period_31 demand plus a small safety cushion. Using recent 3-period avg \u2248 283, required replenishment = 283 \u2212 39 = 244. Add a modest safety buffer (~6\u201310%) to protect against variance; a 6% buffer \u2248 15 units.
