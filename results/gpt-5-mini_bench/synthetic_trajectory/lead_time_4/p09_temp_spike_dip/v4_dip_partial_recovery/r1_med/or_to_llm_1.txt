  "rationale": "Summary of observations: On-hand=0, In-transit=275 (matches orders of 140 from P1 and 135 from P2). We have only concluded messages through Period 2; no arrivals have been concluded yet, so actual lead time is not confirmed (promised L=4). Historical demand samples (P1\u2013P5: 82,89,65,106,136) give single-period mean \u03bc\u0304=95.6 and sample std \u03c3\u0304\u224826.94. OR computed using promised L produced a cap \u2248140 and recommended 142. Why adjust: The pipeline (275) + on-hand (0) covers only ~2.9 expected periods (275/95.6\u22482.88) but we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand until new orders would arrive. Using OR's base-stock math: \u03bc\u0302=(L+1)\xd7\u03bc\u0304=5\xd795.6=478 units target pipeline+on-hand; base_stock including service safety \u2248529 units. To reach the demand-cover target \u03bc\u0302=478 we'd need order_raw \u2248478\u2212275=203 units (to meet expected demand over the L+1 horizon). OR's cap (\u2248140) limits order size to reduce variability, but that cap assumes promised lead time and prioritizes smoothing; given current pipeline shortfall versus the (L+1)-period demand horizon and the relatively high profit margin (profit per unit $4 vs holding $1), I prioritize meeting expected demand over strictly following OR cap. Risks: If supplier shipments ultimately arrive as promised and future orders also arrive, we may hold more inventory (incurring holding cost), but shortage risk and lost sales across the long lead time are costlier given profit weight. Lead-time inference: insufficient concluded evidence to change assumed lead time or mark orders lost. Final decision: order 204 units (rounded from 203) to bring pipeline+new order closer to covering expected demand over the (L+1)=5 period horizon while recognizing holding cost exposure.",
