Given current high on-hand + large in-transit, I only need a modest top-up to cover the 5-period horizon. 6) Decision: order 40 units to bring total committed inventory to 483 (443+40), slightly above the 5-period historical expected demand, providing a small safety buffer for the observed upward trend while avoiding excess holding cost. 7) Risks: if the recent higher-demand regime persists (average ~118.5), this order may undershoot and require larger future replenishments; monitor next concluded arrivals/demands and adjust future orders accordingly.",
