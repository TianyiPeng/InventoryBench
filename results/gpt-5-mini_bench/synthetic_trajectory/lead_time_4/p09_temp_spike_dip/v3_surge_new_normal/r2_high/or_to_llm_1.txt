Historical baseline demand (Periods 1\u20135) has single-period mean \u2248115.4, giving \u03bc\u0302=5*115.4=577 which would imply current pipeline roughly sufficient.

Current pipeline (In-transit=176) likely includes recent orders (e.g., P40 order) that will not arrive until Period 44, so those units are unavailable for demand in Periods 41\u201344. Inventory & demand outlook: On-hand=248 must cover demand for the current period and next 3 periods before any new order (placed now) can arrive (orders placed now arrive in Period 45 arrival phase). Using recent realized demands (Periods 36\u201340: 127,85,131,115,110 \u2192 avg \u2248 114) and medium-term history (~120\u2013130 typical), a conservative 5-period demand estimate is ~5\xd7115 = 575 units. Current available (on-hand + in-transit before new-order arrivals) that will be usable before new arrival is just on-hand 248 (in-transit arrives too late). OR recommended 250 (uses promised L and historical samples). Given high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1/period), understocking is more costly than modest overstock. Strategy: place a larger order than OR to replenish pipeline so arrivals after lead time restore selling capacity for remaining horizon. Calculation: target to cover ~5 periods demand \u2248 575 units; current on-hand 248 \u21d2 need \u2248 327 units to be available by arrivals before stockouts over the next few periods. However ordered units placed now arrive after 4 periods (usable from Period 45 onward), so they mainly replenish later-period sales; still we must ensure pipeline is healthy. I choose to order 400 units to: (1) raise future available inventory after arrival to meet expected remaining demand across remaining periods (10 periods total remaining), (2) modestly exceed the OR cap (250) given confirmed lead time and profit/holding tradeoff, and (3) provide buffer for demand variability.
