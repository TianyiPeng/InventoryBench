Reasoning and decision: After expected arrival of P1 (151) during this period, remaining pipeline will be 291 and on-hand will be sufficient to meet Period 5 demand; however pipeline+on-hand (post-arrival) is still below the base_stock (~629.7) needed to cover expected 5-period demand plus safety stock. To restore a healthier pipeline toward the OR base_stock while respecting the cap logic, I order the cap-sized quantity \u2248150 units (rounded).
