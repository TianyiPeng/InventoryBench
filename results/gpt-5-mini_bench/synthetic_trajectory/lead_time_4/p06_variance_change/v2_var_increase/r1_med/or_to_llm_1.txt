Risk check vs OR: OR recommends 0 using long-run history; with elevated demand 5-period requirement \u2248 5 \xd7 137.3 = 686 units. Pipeline (644) is ~42 units short of that 5-period target. Cost trade-off: profit = $4, holding = $1 implies a high service target (critical fractile 0.8) so err on filling the shortfall rather than stockout. Action sizing: order = max(0, target5 - (on-hand + in-transit)) \u2248 686 \u2212 644 \u2248 42; I round conservatively to 41 units to limit holding cost while addressing most of the shortfall.
