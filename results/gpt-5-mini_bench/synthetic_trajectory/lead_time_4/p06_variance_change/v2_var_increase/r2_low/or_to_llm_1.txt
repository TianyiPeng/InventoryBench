======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: carry-over confirms actual LT=4 (Period 1\u21925, etc.). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pipeline to cover upcoming demand. Demand estimate: recent 5-period mean demand = (163+64+125+56+148)/5 = 111.2 units/period. With profit=holding, critical fractile q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0, so base-stock for review+lead (L+1=5 periods) = \u03bc\u0302 = 5 \xd7 111.2 = 556 units. OR's capped recommendation (179) is much lower but assumes existing pipeline; here pipeline is zero and immediate stockouts will occur. Final decision: order 556 to rebuild pipeline to the 5-period expected demand (base_stock), accepting holding cost risk because otherwise we will stockout for multiple periods while waiting for arrivals. No new multi-period sustained pattern beyond existing carry-over insights was detected.",
