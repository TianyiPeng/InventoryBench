Demand view: historical sample mean = 98.2 units/period; over (L+1)=5 periods \u03bc\u0302 \u2248 491. Safety stock (using q=4/(4+1)=0.8 \u2192 z\u22480.842) adds \u224850 units, giving a base-stock near 541. OR recommended 13, but pipeline+on-hand (475) is ~66 units below base-stock and ~16 units below the 5-period expected demand \u03bc\u0302. Risk assessment: large pipeline will cover much demand but is slightly short of the 5-period expected demand; excess ordering increases holding cost ($1/unit/period). Action rationale: place a small corrective order to cover the immediate expected shortfall (~16) while avoiding excess holding cost. I therefore order 16 units (a modest increase over OR's 13) to bring available inventory closer to the 5-period demand without overshooting safety stock given holding penalties. Follow-up: monitor upcoming concludes to verify all in-transit arrivals (watch for lost shipments) and revise if demand regime shifts or arrivals miss promised lead time.",
