Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_4\p06_variance_change\v3_var_decrease\r1_high\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 58), ('Period_2', 163), ('Period_3', 41), ('Period_4', 0), ('Period_5', 12)]
  Mean: 54.8, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory. Historical samples short and variable (58,163,41,0,12); no sustained regime change detected. No concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time and default demand estimators so OR backend uses full sample mean/variance across (1+L) periods to set base-stock while avoiding overfitting to noisy short series.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=162 (order placed P1 not yet concluded/arrived). No concluded arrivals exist to infer a shorter/longer lead time. Demand history is sparse and no sustained regime change is evident. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps parameters conservative given pending in-transit units and avoids risking understock if the P1 shipment is delayed.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=313. Concluded history shows no arrivals yet for Periods 1\u20132 orders, which is expected given promised lead time=4 (no evidence to change lead time). Demand history is noisy (samples: 58,163,41,0,12) but no sustained regime shift (insufficient consecutive periods). To avoid overreacting to the Period_2 spike and because shipments may still be en route, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its historical mean/std across the full sample, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_4. On-hand=0, in-transit=468 (sum of prior orders). No concluded arrivals in history, so actual lead time is unconfirmed; shipments are in-transit but not yet observed. Use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting. Demand history is limited and volatile; prefer default demand aggregation so the OR backend uses all samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (high profit/higher target fill) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period=Period_5. On-hand=0, in-transit=509 and no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (all arrived=0). Promised L=4 but multiple outstanding shipments past promised lead time suggest extended lead time; to be conservative set L explicit=5. Demand samples mean = 54.8 (periods 1\u20135), so I set mu_hat explicit = (1+L)*mean = 6*54.8 = 328.8 to cover review+lead demand. Sigma set to default so backend computes volatility using chosen L. These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts given large in-transit uncertainty while limiting excess holding by relying on backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (total in-transit=509) did not arrive by promised lead time L=4; evidence of extended/lost shipments\u2014treat lead time as longer until arrivals conclude.

Daily Profit: $494.00, Daily Holding Cost: $136.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $358.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start: On-hand=136, In-transit=434. Concluded arrival in Period_5 shows order from Period_1 arrived with lead_time=4, confirming promised lead time. However several orders (Periods 2\u20134) remain in-transit (434 units) and may be delayed/lost; plan conservatively using observed lead time. Demand history available (samples Periods1\u20135). Set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). This keeps safety stock responsive to observed lead time while not overcommitting given uncertain outstanding shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived in Period_5, lead_time=4); Orders from Periods 2\u20134 (total 434 units) remain in-transit past expected arrival\u2014possible delayed/lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $413.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: recent arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 for observed orders (P1->P5, P2->P6). Current on-hand=252, in-transit=317; some earlier in-transit (orders from P3\u2013P4) remain overdue\u2014treat lead time as 4 until further conclude evidence. I select L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (evidence: two concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Demand shows no sustained new regime (recent demands P2\u2013P6 used), so set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to weight the last five periods' demand for the (1+L) review+lead forecast. Use default sigma_hat to let backend compute volatility from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (use observed L=4 and recent demand) against holding cost given holding is low ($1) and profit is high ($19).

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=314, in-transit=259. Concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1\u20133 had lead_time=4 (P1 arrived in P5, P2 in P6, P3 in P7); some later orders remain in-transit but not yet lost. I set L using 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times =4. Demand shows volatility but no sustained regime shift (spike in one period only), so use default population estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine apply its baseline demand mean/variance across (1+L) periods. This keeps safety stock balanced against holding cost while acknowledging overdue shipments.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current on-hand=328, in-transit=224. Historical concludes show orders from Periods 1\u20134 arrived with lead_time=4; recent arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Some earlier concerns about lost shipments resolved by those arrivals. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (will average concluded lead times ~4). Demand shows variability; no sustained regime shift (insufficient 3+ period evidence) so use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These settings keep the OR engine targets conservative given confirmed lead time and avoid over-reacting to short-term demand noise.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10. On-hand=380, in-transit=142. Multiple concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 5\u20139 = 26,35,93,27,35) indicates a new regime vs earlier noisy history; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect current demand (~43.2 units/period, 5-period total \u2248216). Current pipeline + on-hand (522) comfortably covers the 5-period demand forecast, reducing stockout risk while keeping holding cost reasonable.

Daily Reward (R_t): $446.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10). On-hand=371, in-transit=108; no new missing-shipment pattern beyond earlier reports. Demand has short-term variability (spike in Period_4) but no sustained regime shift. Therefore: set L using observed lead times (calculate) to confirm actual lead time to the backend; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, providing a stable base-stock that balances service level and holding cost given confirmed L=4 and current healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=230, in-transit=57. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P7 concluded with lead_time=4). No new sustained demand regime change (recent spike at P11 is single-period). Use calculated lead time to reflect observed arrivals; use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so OR backend retains robust pooling across history while avoiding overreacting to one-period spikes. This balances service level against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory and small in-transit.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=75, in-transit=240. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=4 for observed orders (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), and several earlier shipments remained delayed but later concluded; thus use observed lead-time estimate. Recent demand has increased vs early samples (last 5 concluded demands: 27,35,43,238,161) indicating higher recent mean and volatility \u2014 use recent_N=5 to capture this regime. L set to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (stable at 4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=5 so the OR base-stock and cap reflect the recent higher demand and volatility, helping avoid stockouts from underestimated pipeline while limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. Recent conclude history shows consistent observed lead_time=4 for multiple concluded arrivals (orders placed P1\u2013P9 arrived with W=4), and on-hand=0 with in-transit=491 (many units still enroute or delayed). Given confirmed lead time evidence, use calculate for L to reflect observed lead times. Demand history shows elevated and variable demand (several large demand periods including 238 and 161); to let the OR engine use full-sample statistics and its capped policy, use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (capture observed higher mean) while relying on OR's cap to limit order size given remaining pipeline and holding cost exposure.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=0, in-transit=664 with multiple earlier orders delayed/persisting in-transit. Observed concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 for all arrived orders (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11, P8\u2192P12, P9\u2192P13). Given consistent evidence, set L by calculating observed lead times. Demand history is limited; no sustained demand regime change detected, so use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps safety stock aligned with observed lead time while avoiding overreacting to transient delays.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=0, in-transit=622. Historical conclude messages consistently show observed lead_time=4 for arrived orders (P1\u2192P5 etc.), and several earlier delayed shipments resolved \u2014 treat lead time as the promised 4. Demand history available is limited; no clear, sustained demand regime shift since prior confirms. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=4) so OR backend accounts for the contractual pipeline. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative base-stock that balances service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so I set L by averaging observed lead times. On-hand=90, in-transit=476; pipeline still large so use default demand sizing to avoid overreacting to noisy short-term swings. Chosen: L=calculate to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples (stable baseline); sigma_hat=default to provide usual uncertainty scaling. This balances service level (use full (1+L) demand coverage) against holding cost given sizable pipeline.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 for observed concluded orders (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use calculated average lead time to capture observed reality. Demand data is limited and variable; use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples. This balances service level (using inferred L) against holding cost without overfitting to short-term swings or potentially noisy recent arrivals.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
On-hand=322, in-transit=257. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders from P1\u2013P14 arriving with lead_time=4). Earlier missing/delayed shipments were resolved and arrivals now align with promised L=4, so use default promised lead time. Demand sample set is small (5 samples) so use backend defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost given current ample on-hand inventory and confirmed L=4.

Concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, etc.), so use inferred lead time. Use L via 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) with holding costs given current ample pipeline.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=131, in-transit=387. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P arrivals with lead_time=4) and earlier missing shipments resolved; no new prolonged losses. Recent demand (Periods 16\u201320 = 99,112,85,100,138) is higher than the very early samples, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 16\u201320) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher-demand regime over the (1+L) review+lead horizon; this balances service level (covering (1+L) demand) versus holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1313.00

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22 context: on-hand=150, in-transit=381; historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (many orders concluded with W=4). Some earlier shipments remained delayed/lost but recent concludes confirm L=4. Demand recent 5 periods (P17\u2013P21) = [112,85,100,138,77], mean ~102; volatility moderate. I set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed average lead time (confirmed =4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to make the OR engine target the most recent demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std) so orders respond to current demand while avoiding overreacting to older noisy data and mitigating risk from past lost shipments by relying on observed concluded arrivals and current pipeline.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_23. On-hand=178, in-transit=337. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders from P1..P18 arrived with lead_time=4). Earlier missing shipments resolved; no sustained new shift in lead time or demand detected. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4. Demand history (samples provided) is limited; no recent changepoint justifies downweighting or explicit forecast, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the backend's base-stock anchored to long-run sample statistics while avoiding overreaction to transient shortages. Current on-hand + in-transit provides multi-period coverage, so defaults balance service level vs. holding cost.

Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (many P->P+4 confirmations), though earlier missing shipments were observed and some delayed units remain in-transit. Given repeated 4-period confirmations, set lead time using observed average. Demand history is limited in the initial seed but no sustained recent regime shift is evident; use default demand aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=217, in-transit=326. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (many P# orders arriving after 4 periods), so actual lead time is stable at 4. Pipeline + on-hand looks sufficient for near-term demand. Use default lead time to trust promised L=4 and keep forecasting based on full sample set: set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28: on-hand=280, in-transit=277. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (many concluded messages: orders placed in Pn arrived in Pn+4). Recent history shows supply flowing with lead_time=4 and no new sustained shipment losses. Inventory + pipeline (557 units) is healthy vs recent demands (typical single-period demand ~70\u2013140). I therefore use the promised/default lead time to align with observed confirmations. For demand forecast and volatility I select default (use all historical samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.95 \u2192 high z) against holding cost while leveraging full-sample estimates. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments are made because recent concluded arrivals confirm L=4 and in-transit has been delivering.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead_time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals list lead_time=4). Current on-hand=234 and in-transit=304 (total pipeline+on-hand=538). Given confirmed LT=4 and no strong recent demand regime shift, set L to calculated (use observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history; this keeps forecasting stable while the backend's capped policy controls order sizing and caps risk from possibly delayed/lost shipments.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_30. On-hand=247, in-transit=294. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 across many periods (P1->P5 arrival, P2->P6, ... P25->P29), so actual lead time is stable at 4. I choose L by calculate to let backend confirm average observed lead time. Demand recently has been moderate and relatively stable (recent demands ~76\u201399 with occasional spikes); to be responsive to the latest regime I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the most recent five periods. This balances service level (using recent demand to avoid stockouts) against holding cost by not overreacting to older spikes or single outliers.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1747.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: recent demand has been stable around high-80s per period (Periods 26-30 demands = 92,76,90,84,102). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 periods (many confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use observed lead time. On-hand (191) + in-transit (248) = 439 units; using (1+L)=5 periods, recent 5-period demand mean \xd75 \u2248 444 \u2014 pipeline is slightly short of a 5-period cover, so base-stock should be set using recent demand to track current regime while keeping volatility measured from the same recent window. Methods chosen: L from observed lead times (calculate); mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent stable demand regime (recent_N, N=5) to reflect current mean/variance and avoid overreacting to older missing-shipment noise.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: recent conclude history shows consistent arrivals with observed lead_time=4 for multiple past orders, so treat actual lead time as 4. On-hand=147 and in-transit=199; some earlier missing shipments resolved but in-transit still present. I set L using calculate (average observed lead times = 4) so the OR engine accounts for the confirmed longer lead time. I choose default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples, providing a stable forecast given no strong, sustained demand regime change in recent history. This balances service level (using confirmed L=4) against holding cost by relying on aggregate demand stats rather than short noisy windows.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33. On-hand=138, in-transit=300. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 periods for arrivals (multiple orders observed with W=4); some earlier shipments were delayed/lost but recent history shows arrivals aligned with 4. Given confirmed LT=4 and no clear demand regime shift (recent demands vary but no sustained >3-period change), use calculated lead time to reflect observed data and default demand estimates to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run average demand while the backend's cap limits order size, balancing service level (high profit) against holding cost.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=125, in-transit=384, promised L=4. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 for orders that eventually arrived (multiple confirmations), though some earlier shipments were delayed/lost; current pipeline (384) plus on-hand covers several periods. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and the confirmed arrival pattern, use default lead time and demand estimates computed from the full sample set: L=default (promised), mu_hat=default ((1+L)*mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). This avoids overreacting to sporadic lost shipments while letting the optimizer balance service level vs holding cost based on long-run stats.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period 35: on-hand=56, in-transit=498. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (many arrivals show lead_time=4), so set L to calculated (backend will average observed lead times). Demand history (seed samples: 58,163,41,0,12) gives mean=54.8; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std to produce base-stock and cap. This balances service (use observed L=4) vs holding cost given current sizable pipeline; defaults avoid overreacting to short-term variability while respecting confirmed lead time evidence.

LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=0, in-transit=522. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (most recent confirmations include arrivals from orders placed P31 arriving in P35), and earlier missing arrivals subsequently concluded. Given current evidence, treat promised lead time=4 as valid. I therefore use L=default (promised). Demand signal is noisy but no sustained recent demand regime shift detected, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base-stock balancing profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1). This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit volume and high holding cost relative to profit.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. On-hand=70, in-transit=448. Historical conclude messages show consistent observed lead times of 4 periods for concluded arrivals (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.) though earlier missing arrivals signaled delays; recent history strongly supports actual lead time = 4. Demand history (recent concluded periods) shows stable high single-period demand (~70\u2013140). I choose L using 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average (captures confirmed L=4). I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given estimated lead time and observed demand variability. This approach is conservative given large in-transit volume and the need to avoid over-ordering if some shipments remain lost/delayed.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period_40. On-hand=171, in-transit=373. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods for many concluded orders (orders placed at Pn arriving at Pn+4). Earlier missing shipments resolved with later arrivals; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change detected. Choose default lead time (use promised/confirmed 4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding aggressive explicit increases that would raise holding costs given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=135, in-transit=342. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many confirmed arrivals with W=4). Recent history shows no sustained demand regime shift; pipeline is healthy and previous missing shipments have since concluded. Therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level with holding cost given current ample pipeline.

No recent evidence of a sustained demand or lead-time regime change. Use promised lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over full sample history, balancing service level with holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Some earlier missing arrivals were resolved; current pipeline large (451) so expect arrivals per promised cadence. Set L to 'calculate' to use average of observed lead times (reflects confirmed 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service vs holding given steady demand history and high pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. Recent history shows confirmed 4-period actual lead time (many concluded arrivals with W=4) and earlier evidence of some lost/delayed shipments, but no new sustained lead-time change. On-hand=106, in-transit=404 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to current on-hand, so avoid inflating forecast. I select default lead time to use the promised L=4 (backend knows promised L and historical concluded LT=4). For demand forecast I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock target that balances profit vs holding cost given the sizable pipeline and confirmed LT. This avoids overreacting to transient delivery anomalies while letting the backend cap orders using its cap formula.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1035.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: on-hand=162, in-transit=390, promised L=4. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 when shipments conclude; earlier missing/delayed shipments were observed but recent concluded history (Periods 5\u201346) shows regular 4-period arrivals. Pipeline (in-transit=390) plus on-hand covers multiple periods of demand, so use default promised lead time and default demand estimates to let OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. Choices: L=default to rely on promised lead time (backed by many observed 4-period arrivals); mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean of all samples (captures long-run average demand); sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples (captures empirical volatility). This balances service level driven by profit/holding ratio while avoiding manual overcorrection for past isolated missing shipments.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_48. History of concluded arrivals shows consistent lead_time=4 (many orders from P1..P47 arrived after 4 periods). Current on-hand=153, in-transit=331; some in-transit remain but no new sustained anomaly. I set L via calculate to use observed lead-time average (confirmed =4). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of historical demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given confirmed L and no clear recent demand regime shift.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_50: on-hand=123, in-transit=401. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 periods (many concluded messages: orders ordered in Pn arrived in Pn+4). Earlier missing/delayed shipments were observed in Periods 1\u20136 but subsequent periods show regular 4-period arrivals, so treat lead time as 4. Use L='calculate' to let backend compute average observed lead time (captures confirmed 4-period actual). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples\u2014this balances service level vs. holding cost given confirmed lead time and the available sample history. Current pipeline + on-hand should cover upcoming (L+1) periods; defaults keep ordering aligned with observed demand variability and the OR cap.
