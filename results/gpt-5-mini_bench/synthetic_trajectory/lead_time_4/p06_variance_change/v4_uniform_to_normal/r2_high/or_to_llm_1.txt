{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed as 4 periods (carry-over & concluded history). Recent demand: last 5 periods (P45\u2013P49) avg = 98.6 units, consistent with previously recorded lower regime (~\u221215% vs P1\u2013P5). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=32 (will arrive per 4-period lead time). OR recommends 132 (uses promised L and full history). I reduce OR recommendation because demand has materially declined vs early history and we already have 32 units in pipeline; ordering the full 132 risks excess holding cost given long L. Final order of 100 balances filling the pipeline for upcoming demand while limiting holding cost exposure given the sustained lower-demand regime and long lead time.",
