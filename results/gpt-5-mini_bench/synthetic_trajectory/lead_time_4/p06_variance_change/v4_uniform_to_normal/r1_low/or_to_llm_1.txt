Current pipeline (in-transit) = 562 and on-hand = 0, so pipeline + on-hand matches the 5-period expected demand. Step 3 - OR recommendation and cap: OR recommends 0 units; its assumptions (promised L and full-history demand) imply no additional order is needed because pipeline equals base-stock target.

No concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time or a lost shipment. Inventory & demand math: Historical sample mean (provided list) = (112+111+80+129+130)/5 = 112.4 units/period.

OR recommended 12 units (capped baseline) but it uses promised L and only historical samples; its small recommendation likely reflects cap behavior given pipeline inventory. Decision: place 0 units. Rationale: the in-transit 562 already matches the (L+1)-period expected demand, so ordering more now would raise ending inventory and incur holding cost equal to profit ($1 holding = $1 profit), worsening objective.
