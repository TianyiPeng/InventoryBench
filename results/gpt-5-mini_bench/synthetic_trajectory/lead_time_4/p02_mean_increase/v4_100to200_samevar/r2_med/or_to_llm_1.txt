Demand analysis: initial small-sample mean was ~91 units/period (samples: 105,36,108,110,96). However periods 16-18 show a sustained higher regime: demands = 229, 243, 187 (avg = 219 over 3 periods), indicating a regime shift upward beginning Period 16. Planning horizon: with lead time L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 future periods of demand. Using the new regime mean \u2248219, 5-period demand \u2248 1,095 units. Pipeline covers 691, so shortfall \u2248 1,095 \u2212 691 = 404 units. Decision: order 404 units now to bring pipeline+on-hand to roughly one (L+1)-period coverage under the confirmed high-demand regime. This balances stockout risk (very costly lost sales) against holding cost; given profit $4 vs holding $1 (critical fractile ~0.8), we bias toward avoiding stockouts when demand appears to have shifted up. Also record the demand-regime shift as a carry-over insight for future periods.",
