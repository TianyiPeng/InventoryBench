Inventory assessment: On-hand=0, In-transit=503 (ordered P1, expected to arrive in P5 if promised LT holds). There will be no arrivals during Periods 2-4 based on available conclude messages, so Periods 2-4 demand (\u2248300 total) cannot be served from on-hand inventory. Ordering now would arrive only after 4 periods (during Period6 if LT=4), so it cannot help unmet demand in Periods 2-4. Cost trade-off: profit per unit = $1, holding = $1/period so carrying inventory yields little net benefit and increases holding cost risk if arrivals exceed future demand. Decision: do not place additional order this period to avoid extra in-transit inventory and holding cost, given existing large in-transit shipment that should cover upcoming periods once it arrives.",
