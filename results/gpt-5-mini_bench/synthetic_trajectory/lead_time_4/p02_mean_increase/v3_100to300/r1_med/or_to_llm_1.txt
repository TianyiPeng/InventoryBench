{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (carry-over). In-transit = 519 equals orders placed in Periods 15\u201318 which will arrive in Periods 19\u201322 respectively; these arrivals will be available to satisfy demand in Period 19\u201322. A new order placed now (Period 19) will arrive in Period 23 and thus covers the last of the L+1=5 periods horizon (Periods 19\u201323).\nDemand assessment: Recent demand has jumped sharply. Periods 16\u201318 demands = 280, 289, 280 (avg=283). The prior 5-period window (P11\u2013P15) avg = 111.2. Using a conservative planning horizon of L+1=5 periods and targeting coverage for elevated demand, expected demand over next 5 periods \u2248 5 \xd7 216.2 (5-period avg P14\u2013P18) = 1,081 units; using the more recent spike (P16\u2013P18 avg=283) would imply even higher coverage (\u22481,415).\nInventory math: Pipeline (in-transit) = 519 will be available across the 5-period horizon; current on-hand = 0 (but 50 of the 519 arrives this period). To cover ~1,081 units needed over next 5 periods, order_raw \u2248 1,081 \u2212 519 = 562 units. OR recommended 234 (uses longer history and promised lead time assumptions) and would understock given recent surge.\nDecision strategy: Prioritize avoiding large stockouts given sustained extreme demand in P16\u2013P18 (three consecutive very high periods). I will order 562 units to bring total available across Periods 19\u201323 close to expected demand (~1,081).
