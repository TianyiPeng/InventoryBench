Lead-time & timing implication: any order placed now will arrive after 4 periods (during Period 5) and will not help satisfy demand in Periods 1\u20134 unless actual lead time is shorter; we have no concluded arrivals yet to infer a different lead time. Risk tradeoffs: profit = holding cost, so safety factor z*=0 (OR appropriately places no extra safety stock beyond expected demand over lead+review), and large upfront ordering risks high holding cost if arrival later than demand spike or if orders are lost. Recommendation reasoning: OR's capped recommendation (126) is essentially one-period coverage under the cap and avoids large exposure to holding cost while keeping some pipeline to begin satisfying future periods if lead time or arrivals turn out favorable. Given no evidence of lead-time deviation, no in-transit stock, and high holding cost equal to profit, I follow OR's capped order to balance stockout risk vs holding cost.
