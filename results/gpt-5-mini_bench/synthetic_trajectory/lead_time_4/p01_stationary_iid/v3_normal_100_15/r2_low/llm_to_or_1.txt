Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrival history to infer lead time shifts. Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show mean demand = 106.4 units/period and moderate variability (std \u2248 15.75). Promised lead time is 4 periods, so we must cover (1+L)=5 periods of demand when computing mu_hat. With no evidence of a changepoint or delayed/lost shipments, I use the default methods so the OR engine applies its standard calculations: L remains the promised value to avoid incorrectly trusting unobserved arrivals; mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to provision for five periods of demand; sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect aggregated uncertainty over the lead+review horizon. This balances service level and holding cost conservatively given zero starting inventory and no confirmed lead-time deviations.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=136 (ordered P1) but Period 1's order has not concluded (arrived=0), so no confirmed lead-time change; promised lead time (4) remains best prior. Historical demand samples (provided) show mean \u2248106.4 units/period and moderate variation. I choose default lead time to rely on the promised L=4, and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock target aligned with long-run historical demand while avoiding overreacting to the single-period non-arrival (which is expected when actual lead time \u2265 promised). Using defaults balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding costs ($1 profit, $1 holding).

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=268 (matches ordered 136 in P1 + 132 in P2). Concluded messages show no arrivals yet for P1/P2 orders, so there is insufficient evidence to change promised lead time (promised=4). Demand history (provided samples) will be used as the baseline forecast. I choose L=default to keep the promised lead time because we have no concluded arrivals that confirm a different actual lead time or lost shipments. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all historical samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost (profit=holding implies q=0.5). Using defaults avoids overreacting to the two zero-arrival conclude messages which are expected until lead time elapses.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand = 0, In-transit = 398. Promised lead time is 4 periods and there are no concluded arrivals yet (Periods 1-3 conclude show arrived=0 for earlier orders), so actual lead time cannot be confirmed \u2014 orders may still be in transit. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean = 106.4 units/period (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). I use the default lead time (promised L=4) because there is no concluded evidence of a different lead time or lost shipments. For demand forecast I select the default methods so the OR backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all = 5\xd7106.4 = 532 (backend computes) and sigma_hat using the default population/scaling (backend computes). Rationale: with L=4, the replenishment horizon is 5 periods; expected demand over that horizon \u2248532 units, while current pipeline (in-transit 398) is below that target, indicating we should replenish to cover the horizon. Using defaults (all-sample mean/std) is appropriate because there is no sustained changepoint or seasonality signaled in the history. This balances service level (cover ~L+1 periods demand) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the safety-stock z* from profit vs holding cost and cap constraints.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_5. Demand context: historical samples for chips(Regular) show recent demands [88,133,93,108,110] (mean=106.4). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 519 which equals the sum of prior orders (136+132+130+121), and no arrivals have been concluded yet \u2014 this is expected because with the promised lead time (L=4) the first order (Period_1) would only conclude as arriving in Period_5 conclude (visible in Period_6). Therefore there is no confirmed evidence of extended lead time or lost shipments. I choose to keep the lead time as the promised/default to avoid overreacting to unobserved arrivals. I also use default demand and volatility calculations so the OR engine will compute mu_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat as sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level vs. holding cost by relying on the full-sample demand estimate and the promised lead time until we observe concluded arrivals that would justify changing estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5): [88,133,93,108,110] mean=106.4. Current inventory: on-hand=53, in-transit=391. One concluded arrival shows the Period_1 order arrived in Period_5 (arrived=136, ordered on Period_1), implying actual lead time = 4 periods consistent with the promised lead time. Several later orders (Periods 2-4) remain in-transit and are still within the 4-period window, so no evidence of lost shipments. To align OR inputs with observed lead time and stable demand, I set L using the average of observed lead times (calculate) which equals 4 based on the concluded arrival. For demand forecast I use the default method ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) because the five-sample history shows no clear sustained shift or volatility regime change; this yields mu_hat = (1+4)*106.4 = 532 (backend computes). For sigma_hat I also use default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) since variance appears stable. These choices keep the backend's base-stock anchored to the observed mean demand over the review+lead period while reflecting confirmed lead-time behavior; with profit=holding cost, the backend will compute the appropriate service level (q=0.5) and cap. Given substantial in-transit inventory (391) plus on-hand (53), we expect upcoming arrivals to cover demand over the lead window; using confirmed lead time prevents over-ordering in response to transient zero-arrival conclude messages.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period_1 order arrived in Period_5: ordered on Period_1, arrive observed Period_5 \u2192 lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-73.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 context: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5; Period 2 order arrived in Period 6). On-hand = 129, in-transit = 330. Recent demands (samples) = [88,133,93,108,110] with mean ~106.4, so typical demand is moderate. Pipeline (in-transit 330) plus on-hand (129) gives ample cover for several periods; no evidence of lost shipments for the concluded orders. Given the confirmed lead time evidence, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR backend uses the empirical average (which equals 4). For forecasting I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available demand samples \u2014 this leverages the full sample set for a stable forecast and appropriate safety stock. Using defaults keeps parameters consistent with observed stable demand and the confirmed lead time, balancing service level (through base-stock computed from full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost (profit and holding cost are equal, so the backend will target q = 0.5 implicitly). No explicit adjustments are necessary because on-hand + in-transit already provides coverage and there is no sustained demand shift or further lead-time anomalies in concluded messages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-61.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 context: confirmed historical lead time evidence shows orders from Periods 1-3 each arrived after 4 periods (lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=160, in-transit=235. Demand history seed (samples) = [88,133,93,108,110], mean=106.4 units/period. Promised lead time is 4; observed lead time is consistently 4. With profit= $1 and holding=$1, the critical fractile q = 0.5, so target service tradeoff is balanced. I choose to let the backend compute lead time from observed arrivals (calculate) to lock in the confirmed L=4. For demand over the review+lead period I use the default historical aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) = 5\xd7106.4 \u2248 532 (backend will compute). For uncertainty I use the default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine uses the full-sample volatility. This choice is conservative but appropriate because: on-hand + in-transit = 395 units; expected demand over next (L+1)=5 periods based on sample mean \u2248532 units, so we are slightly below the 5-period expected demand \u2014 the OR engine will order to bring pipeline toward the computed base_stock. Using defaults leverages the stable historical sample set and the confirmed lead time, while avoiding overfitting to recent short-term dips (Period 6 demand=56) that are not yet a sustained regime change. No new evidence of lost shipments or demand regime shift; continue monitoring arrivals and demand for 3+ periods before changing methods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-105.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9 context: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (arrivals from Periods 1-4 observed at Periods 5-8). Recent on-hand = 193, in-transit = 213. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) mean = 106.4 units/period, (1+L)=5 => (1+L)*mean = 532 units. Given profit = holding cost, the critical fractile q = 0.5 (z*\u22480) so the OR base-stock target will be near the demand forecast. I choose to use the calculated lead time (calculate) to reflect observed data, and default demand/statistics so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all. This keeps ordering aligned with the confirmed 4-period lead time, uses all available demand history (no strong recent regime change), and avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations while ensuring pipeline + on-hand covers the (L+1) review+lead demand window.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 context: historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean 106.4 units/period and recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). Current inventory: on-hand=107, in-transit=289 \u2192 pipeline = 396 units. Promised lead time is 4 and concluded evidence confirms actual lead time = 4 (stable across 5 observed orders). Using L='calculate' lets the backend average observed lead times (will return 4). For demand forecast I choose the default mu_hat: (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) which equals 5\xd7106.4 = 532 (backend computes this). Sigma_hat stays default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to capture observed variability scaled over the multi-period lead+review horizon. Rationale: confirmed 4-period lead time justifies using all-sample historical mean (no recent demand regime shift detected), and default volatility appropriately scales uncertainty over the 5-period horizon. Note pipeline (396) is below the 5-period demand forecast (~532), so the backend's base-stock policy will order to refill toward the target while capping per its cap rule. No missing shipments detected; carry-over insight already recorded previously.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11. Recent confirmed lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show ordered on P1->arrive P5, P2->P6, ... P6->P10). Demand history samples (Periods 1-5): [88,133,93,108,110], mean = 106.4 units/period, std \u2248 15.75. Current inventory: on-hand=48, in-transit=311, total pipeline=359. The OR backend expects mu_hat across review+lead to be (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*106.4 = 532 units; current pipeline (359) is below that, so the optimizer will place orders to replenish toward the base stock. I choose to have the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies the (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean and std. This balances service level (profit and lost-sales risk) against holding cost by using the full historical demand sample for stable estimates, while letting the backend cap order sizes appropriately given its cap formula.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 context: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from past conclude messages. Recent demand history (observed demands P1\u2013P11 = 90,106,102,117,83,56,99,88,94,130,104) shows variability but no sustained upward or downward regime of 3+ periods; the historical sample set provided for seeding (Period_1\u2013Period_5: 88,133,93,108,110) has mean 106.4. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 408 \u2014 pipeline is substantial and consistent with 4-period lead time arrivals observed previously. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirming 4), and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This is conservative: given profit = holding cost ($1 vs $1) the backend targets roughly a 50% fractile (z\u22480), so default aggregation avoids overreacting to recent noisy swings while honoring the confirmed 4-period lead time and the large in-transit inventory. These choices balance service level (using full historical mean across the review+lead window) against holding cost risk given substantial pipeline inventory and no strong evidence of a regime shift.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13 context: on-hand=17, in-transit=402. Historical confirmed lead times (from concluded messages) are consistently 4 periods (Period_1\u2192Period_5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, etc.). Demand sample set provided (chips(Regular)) has mean=106.4 units/period (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). Using the conservative default forecasting approach keeps the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and historical demand: 1) Set L via "calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times (which matches the confirmed 4). 2) Use mu_hat="default" so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean_of_all_samples = 5\xd7106.4 = 532 target pipeline+on-hand. 3) Use sigma_hat="default" so backend computes volatility = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_of_all_samples. Rationale: current pipeline+on-hand = 419 (402+17) is below the default target (~532), so the OR engine will order to refill toward the base stock; given equal profit and holding cost ($1/$1) we want the backend to balance service level vs holdings using its q formula. I choose default/calculate methods because lead time is now well-supported as 4 and there is no sustained change in demand regime requiring recent-window or EWMA adjustments. This will prompt replenishment to restore service while avoiding ad-hoc explicit forecasts.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 context: confirmed historical arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent across concluded arrivals). Current on-hand = 4 and in-transit = 394 (pipeline total = 398), which covers many future periods of typical demand. Recent realized demands (Periods 5\u201313) average around ~94 units/period (historical samples provided earlier also ~106\u219290s range). With profit = holding cost, the critical tradeoff is service level vs. holding: given a very large pipeline, there is no need to inflate forecast or safety stock beyond the backend defaults. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will compute average from concluded arrivals, which equals 4). For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the OR engine\u2019s base-stock calculation aligned with confirmed lead-time and full historical demand, avoiding overreaction to short-term noise while ensuring the large in-transit stock is recognized by the engine when computing orders.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=398 units. Historical demand samples (provided): [88,133,93,108,110], mean=106.4 units/period. Concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (multiple orders observed arriving after 4 periods). Given confirmed lead time=4 and steady demand with no recent sustained regime shift, I choose to let the backend compute lead time from observed arrivals and use default demand estimates. Choices: L set to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed =4); mu_hat set to 'default' (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 5\xd7106.4 \u2248532 projected demand over review+lead window); sigma_hat set to 'default' (backend will compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples). Reason: using calculated L ensures we reflect the confirmed 4-period actual lead time; default mu/sigma use all available samples because there is no sustained, recent demand regime change (no 3+ period consistent shift). This balances service (base stock sized to 5-period demand) against holding cost; note current in-transit (398) is below the 5-period expected demand (~532), so the policy will likely order to top up pipeline but capped by the OR engine cap to limit overstock.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 update: confirmed historical actual lead time = 4 (from concluded arrivals). Current on-hand = 34, in-transit = 366 \u2192 total pipeline = 400 units. Historical demand samples (seed): [88,133,93,108,110], mean = 106.4 units/period. With promised lead time L=4, review+lead horizon = 5 periods \u2192 expected demand \u2248 5\xd7106.4 = 532 units. Pipeline (400) is below that forecast, so the OR engine should target a base-stock that covers ~5 periods of demand. I choose default methods so the backend uses the promised lead time and the full-sample statistics: L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to keep the forecast anchored to the full historical seed, and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so safety stock reflects observed variability across the full sample. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given in-transit shortfall) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute z* from profit vs holding cost and apply the capped order size.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Recent history shows stable demand samples (Period_1-5: 88,133,93,108,110; sample mean=106.4). On-hand = 29, in-transit = 370 (large pipeline). Past concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (recorded previously). Given confirmed L=4, no recent demand regime change (no sustained shift over 3+ periods) and substantial pipeline inventory, use conservative/default forecasting so the OR backend's base-stock calculation relies on full-sample mean/variance. This avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations while the long pipeline clears. Default L keeps promised lead time (4); default mu_hat lets backend compute (1+L)*mean of all samples (which equals the 5-period sum = 532); default sigma_hat uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service level (avoid stockouts while in-transit is large) against holding cost by not inflating safety stock further.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: confirmed lead time = 4 periods from prior concluded messages. Recent demand history (concluded periods) shows roughly stable weekly demand around ~100 units. Current inventory: on-hand=1, in-transit=392 \u2014 large pipeline stock exists from prior orders. I set L using 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time evidence (all observed concludes indicate 4). For forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; given the large in-transit volume and stable demand this avoids overreacting to short-term noise and lets the backend cap orders via its cap rule to prevent excess receipts. This balances service level (profit and lost-sales risk) against holding cost given current heavy pipeline and confirmed L=4.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 19. History shows a stable realized lead time of 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals all with lead_time=4). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 400 (pipeline large). Historical demand samples: [88,133,93,108,110] with mean = 106.4 and visible demand pattern stable\u2014no recent sustained regime shift (last 5 periods fluctuate but not >30%). Promised lead time is 4 and concluded history confirms it; pipeline plus expected arrivals likely covers near-term demand. I choose default methods so the OR backend uses its standard calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1) producing q=0.5 (median target). Using defaults avoids overfitting to short fluctuations and leverages the confirmed lead time and full-sample demand statistics. This also keeps ordering capped by the OR cap to limit excessive new orders given already-large in-transit.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=402 units. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods for many past orders (Period_1\u2192arrived Period_5, Period_2\u2192Period_6, ..., Period_15\u2192Period_19). Pipeline of 402 is large relative to single-period demand (~90\u2013116 historically) so we do not need to aggressively inflate forecasts. I choose to let the OR backend compute lead time as the observed average (calculate) so the engine uses confirmed LT=4 evidence; for demand forecast and volatility I select defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using confirmed LT and full-sample demand stats) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit pipeline and avoids unnecessary extra inventory in-flight.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21. Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier), demand samples average ~106 units/period (historical samples provided). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=407. With L=4 (so review+lead horizon = 5 periods) expected 5-period demand \u2248 532 units, so pipeline (407) is below the 5-period demand and the OR will need to order to restore stock. I select lead time estimation via 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed LT (backend computes average observed LT); I choose default demand and volatility aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). Using defaults keeps the forecast anchored to the full sample set (stable average ~106) while the OR engine's capped-order logic will temper order size given the high holding cost (holding cost = profit, so target service quantile q=0.5). This approach balances avoiding excess holding cost versus restoring coverage because pipeline is currently below the (L+1)-period demand. If future conclude messages show missing arrivals or persistent deviations, I will switch to a recent_N or explicit estimate.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 context: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: Periods 5\u201321 all show orders placed 4 periods earlier arriving). Current on-hand = 2, in-transit = 410 \u2014 ample pipeline but little on-hand now so we must keep orders sized to cover the 4-period lead time plus the current period. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), implying the critical fractile q = 0.5, so the OR backend will target median demand over the review+lead horizon; using default demand estimators lets the backend compute base_stock from full sample history it maintains. I therefore: (1) set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses the confirmed empirical lead time; (2) use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from available demand samples. This keeps our inputs conservative and consistent with the many observed arrivals at lead time 4, while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise. With large in-transit (410) and minimal on-hand (2), the OR engine should order little or nothing this period, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service level over the 4-period lead time.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23 context: on-hand=2, in-transit=400. Historical demand samples (seed) for chips(Regular) are [88,133,93,108,110] (mean=106.4). Carry-over evidence (from Period_6) confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods; recent conclude messages since then consistently show 4-period arrivals. No prolonged lost shipments observed. Promised lead time = 4 and confirmed by history, so I keep L as the promised/default. I choose default demand parameters so the OR backend uses the full-sample statistics: mu_hat default => (1+L)*mean_all_samples = 5*106.4 = 532 (target pipeline for review+lead). Current pipeline + on-hand = 402, which is below that target, so the OR engine will order to refill toward the base-stock while respecting the cap. sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples to reflect observed variability. These choices (default L, default mu_hat, default sigma_hat) rely on the confirmed 4-period lead time and full historical samples; they balance service level (avoid stockouts given confirmed lead time and observed demand) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute z* from profit vs holding cost and apply the capped ordering policy.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24. Context: on-hand = 18, in-transit = 404. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods (many concluded messages from Period 5 onward). Demand samples provided (Periods 1\u20135): [88,133,93,108,110] with mean = 106.4 units/period. Given promised lead time = 4 and confirmed historical lead time = 4, I will let the OR engine compute lead-time from observed data (calculate). There is a very large pipeline (404) relative to recent demand \u2014 this suggests we should avoid inflating the demand forecast beyond the historical mean to prevent excess holding costs. Using default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat (the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples) keeps the forecast anchored to the full-sample mean while the OR engine's cap prevents overly large orders. This balances service-level (we already have substantial in-transit inventory) against holding cost (profit = holding cost, so target service quantile is 50%). No evidence of recent demand regime change requiring a recent_N or EWMA approach.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 snapshot: on-hand=20, in-transit=385 (total pipeline+on-hand=405). Historical demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show mean=106.4 and std\u224815.75. Carry-over shows lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: Period_1 order arrived in Period_5; subsequent concludes consistently show 4). Given confirmed LT=4, I use the default forecasting formulas so the OR engine's (1+L) scaling is consistent with observed lead time. I select L='default' (promised lead time = 4, confirmed by concludes). I select mu_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples = 5*106.4 = 532; this ensures the base-stock is sized to cover the review+lead horizon based on full-sample demand. I select sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples \u2248 sqrt(5)*15.75 \u2248 35.2, providing the engine with aggregate demand volatility across the review+lead period. Rationale for defaults: demand history is limited but stable across the available samples and lead time is confirmed; using defaults gives the OR engine consistent inputs and avoids overfitting to short-term fluctuations. Note pipeline+on-hand (405) is currently below the 5-period expected demand (532), so the backend will likely place replenishment orders to restore the base-stock while respecting the cap.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_26 context: on-hand=35, in-transit=384, recent concluded history shows steady arrivals with confirmed actual lead time=4 (from earlier periods). Demand history (many periods) aligns with the provided sample set; product has symmetric profit and holding cost ($1 each) so service level tradeoff is balanced. Pipeline + on-hand (419 units) covers multiple future periods given mean demand ~ (historical samples). I choose default methods: use promised lead time (default=4) because concluded messages consistently confirm 4-period lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the policy stable, leverages the large in-transit position (avoids over-ordering), and lets the backend cap orders appropriately to balance service level vs holding costs. No evidence of new sustained demand or lead-time regime shifts requiring changes.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: confirmed historical actual lead time = 4 periods (from concluded history). Recent concluded history shows regular arrivals at lead time 4 with no prolonged missing shipments. Historical demand samples (provided) have mean = 106.4 units/period and modest dispersion (std \u2248 15.8). Current inventory position: on-hand = 49, in-transit = 372 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand = 421 units. The OR backend expects parameters for a base-stock policy with promised lead time L=4; using the default heuristics aligns our inputs with the backend calibration and leverages the full sample history. I therefore set: L = default (use promised lead time 4), mu_hat = default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 5\xd7106.4 = 532 target across review+lead), and sigma_hat = default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). Rationale for defaults: (1) lead time is confirmed consistently at 4 in concluded messages so using default avoids overfitting to short-run noise; (2) the full-sample mean/variance are stable over the available periods (no sustained demand regime shift detected), so default (1+L)-scaled estimates give the backend the correct safety-stock and order cap calculations; (3) current pipeline (421) is below the default mu_hat (\u2248532), so the OR engine will place replenishment to cover the (L+1)-period demand while balancing profit vs holding cost via its q-based z* calibration. No evidence of lost shipments or new seasonality requires deviation from defaults.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals). Recent observed demand samples (seed data) have mean \u2248106.4 units/period; demand in the revealed history since Period_5 has remained around ~80\u2013130 with no sustained regime shift. Current on-hand = 59 and in-transit = 344 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to one-period demand, so aggressive ordering is unnecessary and risks high holding costs (holding cost = profit). I choose to let the OR backend use the observed average lead time (method 'calculate') so L=4 is explicit to the backend; for demand forecast I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) because there is no strong, sustained changepoint in demand and the large pipeline argues against increasing \u03bc\u0302. Similarly I keep sigma_hat as default to reflect historical variability. These settings produce a base-stock anchored to the long-run sample mean and let the OR engine cap orders to avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit stock, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_29. Recent concluded history shows consistent arrivals with lead_time = 4 periods for many periods (orders placed in Period t arriving in Period t+4). On-hand = 23, in-transit = 357 \u2014 pipeline is large and recent arrivals are normal (no overdue or missing shipments visible). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1), so the critical fractile is 0.5 (OR backend will target median). Given stable, sustained lead-time evidence and no clear demand regime shift in the concluded history, I choose to let the OR engine use its default demand aggregation over all samples and compute L from observed lead times. This balances service level and holding cost by letting the backend compute (1+L)*mean demand and volatility across the full history while using the empirically observed lead time.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30. Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (every concluded arrival lists lead_time=4). Demand sample set (provided) has mean = 106.4 units/period (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). With promised lead time 4 and confirmed actual =4, the review+lead horizon is (1+L)=5 periods, so target demand coverage = 5 * 106.4 = 532 units. Current visible inventory (on-hand 23 + in-transit 379 = 402) is ~130 units below that coverage, so the optimizer should replenish to close that gap. I select L="calculate" to lock in the confirmed lead time observed in concludes (average observed lead times = 4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use the defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this is appropriate because the historical samples show no sustained regime shift (mean stable) and we have consistent lead-time evidence. Using defaults balances service level vs holding cost by letting the backend compute the base-stock from the historical mean/variance and the profit/holding cost ratio, while our L choice ensures the backend applies the correct horizon given confirmed lead time. Because there is a visible shortfall (402 vs target ~532), the capped ordering rule will trigger replenishment but the cap prevents extreme single-period orders, limiting holding cost risk if demand volatility is larger than expected.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_31. Demand context: long history of stable demand with no clear recent regime shift; observed arrivals in concluded periods consistently show actual lead time = 4 (many concluded messages: orders placed in P1..P26 arrived after 4 periods). Inventory: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 396 units (sufficient pipeline currently). Given confirmed actual lead time of 4 and stable demand, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect the confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand forecast and uncertainty I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively \u2014 this leverages the full sample history and matches the confirmed lead time. This choice keeps the OR engine's base-stock and cap calculations aligned with observed lead time and stable demand, avoiding overreaction to short-term noise while ensuring pipeline + orders target cover (L+1) periods of demand. No evidence of lost shipments beyond the documented pattern, and current in-transit stock (396) appears adequate to cover upcoming demand spikes.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32. Demand context: historical sample mean from the provided demand samples (Periods 1\u20135: 88,133,93,108,110) is 106.4 units/period. Promised lead time is 4 and lead time was previously confirmed as 4 (carry-over). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=425. With L=4, the review+lead demand (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 5\xd7106.4 \u2248 532 units. Pipeline (425) + on-hand (0) is ~425, which is short of the expected 5-period demand (~532) so some replenishment is warranted to avoid stockouts. Demand history appears stable with no sustained changepoint since the lead time confirmation and many periods of consistent arrivals, so I use the backend defaults (promised/confirmed lead time and full-sample demand stats). Using default methods lets the OR engine compute base_stock and capped order using the full-sample mean and std, which balances the 50% service-level tradeoff implied by Profit=Holding and keeps holding cost from rising due to over-ordering.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Observed on-hand=14 and a large in-transit=405. Historical conclude messages (Periods 5\u201332) consistently show arrivals matching orders placed 4 periods earlier \u2014 actual lead time confirmed = 4 periods. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so critical fractile q = 0.5 (OR backend will set z*\u22480). Given stable demand history and the confirmed, sustained lead time=4, I choose to let the backend compute L from observed lead times and use default demand/statistics calculations for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps decisions consistent with the verified lead time and lets the OR engine compute the (1+L)-period forecast and safety stock using all available samples; that balances service level vs holding cost given q=0.5 and the large existing pipeline inventory (which will cap orders via the engine's cap). No new missing-shipment signal is present; in-transit looks healthy.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34 context: confirmed stable actual lead time = 4 periods (several concluded arrivals show W=4). Current on-hand=13 and in-transit=362 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover multiple periods of demand. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), so the backend should target a balanced service level (q = 0.5) to avoid excessive holding. Demand history since Period_5 shows no sustained regime shift in mean or volatility; arrivals have consistently matched a 4-period lead time. Therefore I let the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) and use default aggregate demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies its baseline base-stock and cap formulas using all historical samples. This choice leverages the confirmed lead time and stable demand to balance service level versus holding cost while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35 context: on-hand=36, in-transit=388. Historical demand samples (seed) show mean \u2248106.4 units/period (samples: 88,133,93,108,110) and the long game history exhibits consistent per-period demand around this level with no sustained recent regime shift. Carry-over previously confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (observed repeatedly in conclude messages). Pipeline (388) plus on-hand (36) => total available 424 units, which covers multiple future periods given average demand (~106). No recently lost shipments or arrival anomalies are visible in concluded periods. Given the confirmed lead time and stable demand, I select L using 'calculate' so the OR backend uses the observed lead-time average (matches confirmed 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this appropriately scales the demand forecast and volatility across the review+lead period, letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and cap. This balances service (profit=holding so critical tradeoff) by relying on confirmed lead time and full-sample estimates rather than overreacting to short-term noise. If future concluded periods show a sustained demand shift or missing arrivals, I will record a carry-over insight and switch to recent_N or explicit estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Recent long history shows stable lead time = 4 periods (confirmed previously). Demand context: small-snack category with historical sample mean = 106.4 units/period (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). Current inventory position: on-hand = 50, in-transit = 355 => pipeline inventory = 405. With promised/confirmed L=4, the review+lead horizon is (1+L)=5 periods. Using default methods keeps the backend's baseline forecast and variance scaling consistent with observed stable lead time and the small sample demand statistics. Numerical anchors: mean(daily samples)=106.4 \u2192 mu_hat (default) = 5 * 106.4 = 532.0 units. Sample std \u2248 17.61, scaled by sqrt(5) \u2192 sigma_hat (default) \u2248 39.4. Rationale for choices: (1) L: stick with promised (and observed) 4 to align arrival timing with observed concludes; (2) mu_hat default uses full-sample mean scaled over the 5-period horizon to ensure sufficient coverage of expected demand; (3) sigma_hat default uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L) to reflect demand uncertainty over the multi-period lead. Given the large in-transit (355) plus on-hand (50) = 405 vs mu_hat 532, we are slightly short of the 5-period expected demand; the OR engine will top up toward the base stock computed from these estimates while capping orders. This balances service level (profit = $1/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) by using the default q implicit in the backend formula.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37: On-hand=34, In-transit=372 (pipeline total=406). Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) are [88,133,93,108,110] (mean=106.4, std\u224815.76). Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (observed consistently in conclude messages). Given confirmed L=4 and stable demand samples with no recent changepoint (no 3+ period sustained shift), I choose the default calculations so the OR backend uses its standard formulas: L as promised (4), mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect the demand over review+lead period, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect aggregated variability. This keeps ordering aligned with observed demand and the long lead time, avoids overreacting to short-term noise, and balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by letting the backend compute the service-level z* using q=0.5.

Daily Reward (R_t): $95.00

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 context: on-hand = 9, in-transit = 384, profit = $1/unit, holding = $1/unit/period. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period realizations for past arrivals (orders placed repeatedly arrived after 4 periods). Pipeline is large (384 units) relative to current on-hand and typical demand (~106.4 sample mean from provided demand samples), so immediate shortage risk is low. I set L = calculate to let the backend use observed lead times (all concluded lead times = 4) rather than blindly trusting the promise; this aligns with confirmed behavior. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples \u2014 this uses the full sample base (stable demand history) and scales for the review+lead period (L+1=5). These choices balance service (maintain enough stock given a long L and a large pipeline) against holding cost by relying on the long-run demand estimate and observed lead time rather than shrinking targets that could increase stockouts or amplify holding costs given the sizable in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_39 context: On-hand = 21, in-transit = 362. Promised lead time = 4 and prior concluded history (Period_5 onward) consistently shows arrivals with lead_time = 4 \u2014 this confirms actual lead time = 4. Recent demand (Periods 34\u201338 = 77, 93, 92, 104, 114) averages 96 units/period, which is representative of current regime (no sustained spike/drop longer than 3 periods). To size the (review+lead) demand forecast I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to reflect the most recent demand regime and avoid stale early-sample bias. Volatility has also been moderately steady in the last 5 periods, so I use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect current uncertainty. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a base stock that covers five periods of the current demand level while keeping safety stock aligned with recent variability; this balances service (avoiding stockouts given long lead time) against high holding cost (equal to profit), using recent data rather than the very early noisy samples.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: demand history (seed samples) shows mean ~106.4 units/period; promised lead time is 4 and historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=3, in-transit=385 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=388, which is roughly 3.6\xd7 the 5-period expected demand (5\xd7106.4=532), so we remain well-stocked but should let OR backend size the next order. Given stable demand samples, confirmed lead time, and no recent changepoint evidence, I use the default estimates so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance and the promised lead time. This balances service level (profit and stock availability) against holding cost by avoiding manual over-adjustment when pipeline already provides substantial coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $96.00

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. Recent full-history shows stable demand with sample mean 106.4 (from provided samples 88,133,93,108,110) and consistent arrivals indicating actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in history). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=402 (sufficient pipeline coverage for multiple periods). Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/unit), so the backend's service-level tradeoff will use q = 0.5; using the backend defaults preserves that balance. I therefore (1) keep L at the promised/confirmed lead time so pipeline sizing aligns with observed arrivals, (2) use default mu_hat to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean from all samples, reflecting stable historical mean demand, and (3) use default sigma_hat so the backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This conservative choice avoids overreacting to short-term noise given ample in-transit stock and consistent lead-time behavior; it also leverages the OR engine's capped-order logic to limit order size and reduce holding costs while maintaining service level.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42 context: chips(Regular) has on-hand=0 and in-transit=408. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed in Period_t arrive in Period_t+4), so promised lead time is confirmed. I choose to let the OR engine use the confirmed lead time (calculate) so pipeline coverage is correctly estimated. For demand parameters I use the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages all historical demand data (including the provided samples and the long history of period demands) to balance fill rate vs holding cost. Given profit = holding cost, the critical service level is 50% \u2014 default base-stock calculation will reflect that tradeoff. Current pipeline (408) already provides multi-period coverage; using defaults prevents overreacting to recent variability and avoids unnecessary holding cost while preserving service. If arrivals begin missing or demand shows a sustained shift, I will switch to recent_N or explicit forecasts in a future period.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43 context: on-hand=19, in-transit=395, recent demands (Periods 38-42) = [114, 92, 110, 98, 85] with recent mean = 99.8. Promised lead time = 4 and past concluded history consistently shows lead_time = 4, so use promised/default lead time. Pipeline (in-transit 395 + on-hand 19 = 414) is large relative to one lead+review horizon demand (~5*99.8 \u2248 499), but some pipeline units will only arrive after the 4-period lead; we must keep ordering to smooth arrivals and avoid stockouts. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the most recent demand regime (stable last 5 periods) so the OR engine's base_stock targets current demand levels (recent mean \u224899.8 \u2192 (1+L)*mean \u2248499). Using recent_N for sigma captures recent volatility rather than older history, helping the backend set a reasonable safety stock given current variability. These choices balance service (avoid lost sales with substantial pipeline and a 4-period lead) against holding cost by not inflating the forecast with older outlying samples.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Demand sample history (provided) has mean = 106.4 units/period (samples: 88,133,93,108,110). Given the long, stable trail of concluded arrivals at lead time 4 and no strong evidence of a recent demand regime shift, use conservative defaults that align with the promised/observed lead time and full-sample demand statistics. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time (which matches the repeated 4-period arrivals), and mu_hat/sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps ordering aligned with the long lead time, avoids overreacting to transient inventory levels (on-hand is low but large pipeline exists), and lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost using standard base-stock math.

Daily Reward (R_t): $94.00

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. Observed on-hand=17, in-transit=369. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed in carry-over). Pipeline is large relative to on-hand and recent demand, so no strong evidence of a demand regime change; risks from lost shipments are low given steady past arrivals. I therefore use the default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample history. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise and lets the capped ordering cap limit order sizes given current sizeable pipeline, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46 context: on-hand=7, in-transit=385. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 4-period actual lead time (confirmed earlier). Recent demand has been roughly steady in the 80\u2013130 range (historical episodes show typical weekly demand ~100). With profit = holding = $1, critical service/holding tradeoff is balanced (q = 0.5 \u2192 target z near 0). On-hand + in-transit (392 units) already covers multiple lead+review periods of demand (L+1), so no aggressive upward adjustment is needed. I therefore choose the default methods: keep L as promised (default) because concluded history confirms the promised 4-period lead time; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend produce the base-stock and enforce its cap. This keeps orders conservative given large pipeline inventory and equal profit/holding costs, avoiding excess holding while maintaining service.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 decision. Recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) have mean=106.4 units/period; product is chips(Regular). On-hand=16, in-transit=401 \u2192 pipeline inventory = 417 units. Promised lead time is 4 periods and historical conclude messages (Periods 5\u201346) consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4, so I will use the promised/confirmed L=4. Using default forecasting (method defaults) gives (1+L)=5 review+lead horizon. Default mu_hat uses all samples \u2192 forecast = 5 \xd7 mean(all samples) = 532 units; default sigma_hat uses std(all samples) scaled by sqrt(1+L). Rationale for defaults: sample history is short but stable, confirmed lead time=4, and current pipeline (417) is below the 5-period demand forecast (~532), so the OR backend will order to raise pipeline toward the base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost (q = profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5 \u2192 moderate service target). Using defaults avoids overfitting to short recent noise and leverages the backend's capped-order logic to limit order size while addressing the deficit vs expected 5-period demand. If future concluded arrivals show lead-time or demand regime shifts, I'll switch to a recent_N or explicit method.

Daily Reward (R_t): $101.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48 decision. Recent demand has been stable around ~100 units/period (many concluded periods show demand mostly in 80\u2013130 range, recent bursts near 110\u2013112). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 397. Observed concluded arrivals across history consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed observed arriving after 4 periods), so I use a calculated L to reflect that evidence. With L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods; at a typical demand ~100 that implies a target pipeline \u2248500 units, so current in-transit (397) is somewhat short \u2014 the OR backend will increase ordering via its base-stock calculation. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this is appropriate because demand appears stationary (no sustained changepoint of 3+ periods). Using calculated L plus default mu/sigma balances service level (covers multi-period demand under confirmed L=4) while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision. Recent concluded history shows a stable demand pattern with no strong regime shifts and confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (observed repeatedly in conclude messages). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=403 units. With promised/observed L=4, the pipeline already contains substantial coverage for upcoming demand (403 units \u2248 multiple periods of demand given historical average demand ~104 units). I choose to let the OR engine use its default demand estimates based on the full sample set so it balances service level vs holding cost using established statistics. Using 'calculate' for L directs the backend to use observed lead times (confirmed = 4); 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which is appropriate because there is no recent sustained changepoint and on-hand + pipeline currently appear adequate, avoiding unnecessary additional ordering that would raise holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_50. Demand history across concluded periods consistently shows orders arriving with lead_time=4 (confirmed in Period_6 and all subsequent conclude messages). On-hand = 35, in-transit = 388 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to one-period demand so risk of stockout is low but holding cost equals profit ($1 vs $1) so avoid excess safety stock. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend use the observed average lead time (confirmed = 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand samples; this leverages the full historical series while respecting the confirmed lead time and keeps the OR engine's service-level tradeoff consistent with profit/holding parity.
