No evidence of a sustained upward or downward shift. c) Lead time vs. missing orders: supplier promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals or in-transit shipments are visible, so treat actual lead time as unknown and assume promised lead time for planning. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0.

Observed concluded demands: Period_1=90, Period_2=106, which are consistent with that mean. c) Lead time / missing orders: Promised lead time = 4 periods. There is a single outstanding order of 532 placed in Period_1 and currently shown as in-transit; no concluded arrivals have been observed yet, so we cannot confirm actual lead time or that the order is lost. Per rules, do not infer lead-time change without concluded arrival evidence. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 532. To cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand at the estimated mean (~104.4) we'd need ~522 units. The current in-transit quantity (532) already approximately covers five periods of expected demand. e) Final order logic: Because the pipeline already covers the recommended (L+1) periods and holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), placing additional order now would likely reduce objective by incurring holding costs on units that may arrive before they are needed.

  "rationale": "a) World/product: chips(Regular) is a staple snack with fairly stable demand; no calendar events provided so no special spikes expected. b) Demand regime: Recent demands (Periods 36-40) = [92, 104, 114, 92, 110], recent average \u2248 102.4 units/period. I will use 102 units/period as the short-term forecast. c) Lead time & arrivals: Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 4 periods. In-transit = 430 units corresponds to orders placed in Periods 37-40 (100,125,104,101). With LT=4, only the Period 37 order (100 units) will arrive during Period 41's arrival resolution and thus be available for Period 41 demand; later in-transit shipments arrive in subsequent periods. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0. Expected available for Period 41 demand = arrival from P37 = 100. To cover the next (L+1)=5 periods (Periods 41\u201345) at forecast 102 units/period requires \u2248 5 * 102 = 510 units (using rounded forecast) \u2014 more precisely \u2248 512 using 102.4. Current pipeline + on-hand = 430 units (arriving across P41\u2013P44) plus 0 on-hand = 430, so there is a shortfall of about 80\u201382 units to cover five periods. Given high holding cost = $1/unit/period equal to profit, avoid excess stock; order only the shortfall to meet service while minimizing holding cost. e) Final order logic: Place an order to cover the deficit for Periods 41\u201345. Ordering 82 units will bring total pipeline to ~512 units arriving across the next 4 periods plus the new order arriving in Period 45 (order placed now with LT=4). This balances service (avoid lost sales) and holding cost exposure.",

Recent 5-period average (P44\u2013P48) \u2248 107.2 units. This is consistent with the longer history which centers around ~90\u2013120 units per period. No evidence of a new sustained regime shift.\n\nc) Lead time and missing orders: Carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (observed earlier). Concluded history goes through Period_48 arrivals (which were orders from Period_44). Orders placed in Periods 45\u201348 are currently in-transit and sum to 300 units (111 from P45, 107 from P46, 82 from P47, 0 from P48).

The remaining 82 units arrive in P51 (after horizon). Expected demand for P49 \u2248 100\u2013110; for P50 similar. Holding cost = $1/unit/period and profit = $1/unit. Orders placed in Period_49 would arrive in Period_53 (Period_49 + 4 = P53) and therefore cannot be sold within the remaining game horizon (up to P50). Thus placing new orders now yields zero sales and only incurs holding cost after arrival (but arrivals are after horizon so they do not affect reward) \u2014 effectively pointless.\n\ne) Final order logic: Do not place any new order in Period_49. Rely on in-transit shipments to satisfy demand in P49\u2013P50 as they arrive. Ordering now cannot affect available inventory before the game ends due to the 4-period lead time.\n",
