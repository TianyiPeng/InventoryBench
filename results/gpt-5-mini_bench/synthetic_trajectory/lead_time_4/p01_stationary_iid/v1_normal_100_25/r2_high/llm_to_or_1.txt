Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No concluded arrivals or prior history beyond the 5 demand samples, on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 4 and there is no evidence of lost or shortened shipments (no 'arrived' conclude messages to analyze), so do not change the lead-time assumption yet. Historical sample mean = 89.8 units/period (samples: 100,69,92,77,111). (1+L)=5 so the natural default demand-across-review+lead equals 5\xd7mean = 449 units (this equals the sum of samples). Profit vs holding implies a very high service target (q = 19/(19+1) = 0.95) so the backend will target a high z. Given absence of changepoint evidence and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time, use default methods so the OR engine applies its formulas consistently. This keeps the pipeline sized to cover L+1 periods of expected demand while letting the engine cap order size per its cap. If missing arrivals appear in future concludes, revise L and mu/sigma accordingly.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=118 (from Period_1 order). No concluded arrivals have been observed yet so actual lead time is still unknown. The in-transit 118 may cover upcoming demand but arrival timing is unclear until a future 'conclude' message. I will use the promised lead time (default) and default demand statistics to avoid overfitting to a single delayed arrival and to let the OR engine compute base_stock using the full sample set. This keeps service-level sizing consistent while avoiding premature increases in forecast or safety stock due to a single period of missing arrivals. Using defaults (promised L and population mean/std) balances profit vs holding cost conservatively given limited evidence of a lead-time or demand regime change. I will monitor future conclude messages for confirmed lead-time or demand shifts and adapt if a sustained pattern emerges.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=233, recent concluded messages show no arrivals for orders placed in Period_1 and Period_2 (arrived=0). Promised lead time is 4 periods; we have insufficient concluded evidence to infer an actual lead-time change (need >=3 sustained periods of delay) and no clear demand regime shift in the 5-sample history. To avoid overreacting to potentially delayed or lost shipments, I use the defaults so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) with the promised lead time. This balances service level (using full-sample forecast) against holding cost while we gather more arrival/conclude data to detect sustained lead-time or demand shifts.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=348, concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not yet arrived (arrived=0), but no concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time\u2014do not assume lead-time change yet. Demand history (samples) for chips(Regular) = [100, 69, 92, 77, 111] (mean=89.8). There is a large in-transit balance (348) that should cover multiple periods once arrivals conclude; however, until we see concluded arrivals we cannot treat shipments as delivered. To be conservative and consistent with the sandbox rules, use the promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility aggregation across all samples: mu_hat default uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level (high profit per unit) with holding cost by letting the OR backend compute the base stock using the full-sample demand estimate while capping orders via the engine's cap. We do not record a new carry-over insight because missing arrivals are not yet a confirmed lead-time shift (need concluded arrivals over multiple periods).

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 context: promised lead time=4. Historical demand samples provided (Periods 1-5 = 100,69,92,77,111; mean=89.8). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=468. All conclude messages (P1-P4) show arrivals=0 so no concluded arrivals to infer a different actual lead time or a lost-shipment pattern yet. Because there are no concluded arrivals, I will keep L at the default (promised) value. I also use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). Rationale: the in-transit quantity (~468) is close to the default forecasted pipeline need ((1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 449), so aggressive up-weighting of mean or increasing safety-stock is not justified without confirmed lead-time or demand regime shifts. Keeping defaults lets the OR engine apply its capped ordering logic while avoiding overreaction to unconfirmed delays.

Daily Profit: $912.00, Daily Holding Cost: $70.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $842.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 context: recent concluded history shows the Period 1 order (118 units) arrived in Period 5, giving an observed lead time of 4 periods. On-hand = 70, in-transit = 409 (many later orders placed in Periods 2-4 have not yet concluded and may be delayed or lost). Demand history (Periods 1-5): [100, 69, 92, 77, 111], mean = 89.8. Promised lead time = 4 and arrival evidence confirms actual lead time = 4 for the one concluded shipment. Given confirmed L=4, I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this uses all data while the backend's capped policy will limit order size if needed. Rationale for choices: - L: use calculate to reflect observed lead-time evidence (average of observed lead times = 4). - mu_hat: default (1+L)*mean(all samples) to capture the full demand sample set now that lead time is confirmed; with L=4 this yields (1+4)*89.8 = 449 forecast across review+lead period. - sigma_hat: default to let backend compute volatility across (1+L) periods. Operational note: profit $19 vs holding $1 implies a very high service-level target; keeping mu_hat based on confirmed longer lead time (L=4) and using backend cap guards against excessive orders if some shipments are lost. I also flag that several orders placed in Periods 2-4 remain unconcluded and should be monitored (risk of lost shipments).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 \u2014 arrived=118 units, lead_time was 4 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1075.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 context: confirmed lead time = 4 periods (from prior conclude). Historical demand samples (periods 1-5) have mean 89.8 units and moderate variability. Current inventory position: on-hand=122, in-transit=339. With promised/confirmed L=4, the review+lead horizon is 5 periods; default forecast (5\xd7mean) implies expected demand \u2248449 units over the horizon. Using default methods keeps the OR engine's baseline (mu_hat and sigma_hat) tied to full-sample statistics and the confirmed lead time, which is appropriate because we have consistent evidence (orders from P1 and P2 arrived after 4 periods). I choose default L so the backend uses the promised (and now-confirmed) 4-period lead time. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level needs (profit high relative to holding cost) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the z* and cap. Reconciliation: on-hand + in-transit = 122+339=461 units, which slightly exceeds the 5-period demand forecast (~449), so the OR engine should order little or nothing this period; using defaults avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise or missing-shipment risk (no recent lost shipments).

Daily Reward (R_t): $843.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 context: confirmed lead time = 4 periods from prior concluded messages (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7 all W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=183, in-transit=277. Historical demand samples available (Periods 1\u20135). No evidence of lost shipments beyond the confirmed 4-period lead time. I choose to use a lead-time estimate that reflects confirmed observations (method=calculate) so the OR engine uses the observed L=4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use the defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all historical samples; this leverages all available demand history and aligns the base-stock with the confirmed lead time. This balances service level (maintaining coverage for L+1 periods of demand given substantial in-transit stock) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the statistical safety stock and cap using the provided profit/holding parameters.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1777.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 context: confirmed lead time is 4 periods from prior concluded arrivals. Recent realized demand (Periods 4\u20138) = [101, 48, 63, 54, 104], mean = 74 units/period and sample std \u2248 23.8. Current on-hand = 199 and in-transit = 202 (total pipeline+on-hand = 401). With promised/observed L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods; expected demand over that horizon using recent mean = 5\xd774 = 370 units. I choose L by calculating observed lead times (supports confirmed L=4). For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 4\u20138) because earlier periods before Period 4 reflect a different baseline and the last five periods show the most relevant demand pattern. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=5 so the safety stock reflects recent variability (std \u224823.8 \u2192 scaled by sqrt(1+L) in backend). This combination directs the OR backend to target roughly 370 units of expected demand over the lead+review horizon while sizing safety stock from recent volatility; with high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) we want a relatively high service target but are anchoring forecasts to recent behavior to avoid overstocking from older outlying data. Given current pipeline+on-hand (401) we expect little or no order this period unless the backend cap/policy dictates topping up to the computed base stock after accounting for in-transit inventory. No evidence of lost shipments beyond those already resolved.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10 context: historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) average 89.8 units/period with noticeable variability. Promised lead time = 4; concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals (evidence in prior periods). Current inventory: on-hand=206, in-transit=210, total pipeline=416. With L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods; naive 5-period demand = 5\xd789.8 = 449 units, so current pipeline is slightly below the 5-period expected demand (416 vs ~449). No recent multi-period shipment losses observed; lead time has been stable at 4. Given stable lead time and no clear recent demand regime shift, I use the observed lead time (calculate) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled for the (1+L) horizon. This balances service level (avoid stockouts from confirmed 4-period lead time) against holding cost by letting the backend compute z* and apply the capped order cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1409.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 context: on-hand=168, in-transit=252 (pipeline total=420). Historical demand samples (seed) have mean \u224889.8 units/period (samples: 100,69,92,77,111). Multiple concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10). I therefore set L using the observed lead-times instead of blindly trusting the promise. For demand forecasting and volatility I select the backend defaults so it uses all available samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this keeps the estimate robust to the small sample size and matches the OR engine's capped ordering logic. Rationale specifics: (1) L: choose observed-average lead time to reflect confirmed 4-period actual; (2) mu_hat & sigma_hat: use default/all-sample methods so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service-level (profit $19 >> holding $1) with holding cost by letting the OR engine compute a high service quantile but constrained by its cap. Note pipeline (420) is slightly below a naive 5-period demand forecast (~449), so the OR engine will likely place an order; using observed L avoids under-ordering from a mis-specified lead time, and default volatility keeps safety stock conservative given limited data.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12 context: confirmed lead time is 4 periods (from earlier concluded arrivals). Recent demand (Periods 7-11 = 54,104,52,83,95) has mean 77.6 units/period, so (1+L)=5 \u2192 demand across review+lead \u2248 388 units. Current on-hand + in-transit = 126 + 279 = 405 units, which slightly exceeds the 5-period expected demand, giving a small safety cushion. No new missing shipments observed. Therefore I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (stable at 4), and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime (detectable shift around Period 7). This balances service level (using recent demand average) against holding cost by not inflating the forecast with older data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1069.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13. Recent realized demand (Periods 1\u201312) shows variability with a modest downward shift since the early highs; last 5 demands (Periods 8\u201312) average ~79.2 units/period vs. the longer-sample mean ~89.8. On-hand = 109, in-transit = 305 (no overdue/concluded-missing shipments visible). Carry-over evidence previously confirmed actual lead time = 4. I choose L by 'calculate' so the OR backend uses the observed lead-time average (confirmed = 4). For demand, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat: this targets the most recent regime (Periods 8\u201312) which better reflects current demand levels and prevents over-ordering given sizable pipeline. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility rather than older high-variance samples. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the current lower-demand regime while keeping enough safety stock for lead time = 4; that balances high unit profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) and the large pipeline already in-transit.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 context: confirmed lead time = 4 periods from prior conclude messages. Recent demand (Periods 1\u201313) averaged ~79.4 units/period with moderate variability; (1+L)=5 \u2192 5-period demand forecast \u2248 397 units. Current inventory position: on-hand=107, in-transit=301, pipeline total=408 which already modestly exceeds the 5-period demand forecast. No evidence of lost shipments (arrivals have consistently shown 4-period lead time). Given the confirmed lead time and that pipeline > expected 5-period demand, use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base_stock and caps using its full historical statistics. This avoids over-ordering while letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost with its z* calibration.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2366.00

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Recent demand has been roughly stable but with a spike in Period 14 (128); overall last 5-period mean demand = ~87.4 units/period. On-hand = 66, in-transit = 296 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand = 362 units. Promised lead time = 4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4, so plan for (1+L)=5 periods of demand coverage. Five-period demand coverage \u2248 5 \xd7 87.4 \u2248 437 units, so current pipeline is short (~75 units). To correct this while keeping holding costs low, I use a short recent-window forecast (last 5 periods) for both mean and volatility so the OR backend will raise the base-stock toward current demand levels without overreacting to a single-period spike. I choose to let the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate) because observed concluded lead times are all 4 (consistent) and the backend's averaging is appropriate. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime. This balances service level (cover ~5 periods) against holding cost by reflecting recent demand and variance rather than older samples.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 context: on-hand=39, in-transit=347, profit=19, holding=1. All concluded arrivals to date show a consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Recent demand (Periods 5\u201315) shows a higher and more variable regime than the initial seed samples, with recent demands = [48,63,54,104,52,83,95,62,69,128,107] (mean \u2248 80, elevated volatility). Given confirmed actual lead time = 4 and the clear shift to higher recent demand, I set L using calculate to let the backend confirm the observed lead time average, and I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (the last 11 concluded demand periods) so the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the current, elevated demand regime. This increases the base-stock target to maintain service while the OR backend balances profit vs holding cost. Using recent_N for both demand mean and std helps avoid under-ordering from stale early samples and better matches the current demand pattern; choosing N=11 follows the detected recent regime length (Periods 5\u201315).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: Observed on-hand=30, in-transit=381. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5): [100,69,92,77,111], mean=89.8 units/period, sum over (1+L)=5 periods = 449 units. Confirmed lead time evidence from history (Period 6 carry-over) shows actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed in P1..P12 consistently arrived after 4 periods). Pipeline (on-hand + in-transit = 411) is slightly below the 5-period demand forecast (449) by ~38 units, suggesting a modest replenishment need. Given consistent historical lead time = 4 and no recent sustained demand regime shift (last several period demands are in line with the sample mean, though with variability), I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead times. For demand and volatility I use default aggregate estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (using all available demand history) against holding costs; it relies on the confirmed 4-period lead time to size the review+lead demand coverage while letting the OR engine apply the z* tradeoff between profit and holding cost.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 context: on-hand=16, in-transit=418, historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1..P13 arrived exactly 4 periods later). I therefore set L by calculation so the backend uses observed lead times. Demand context: recent realized demands from Period_5 through Period_17 show a stable higher-rate regime vs the initial seed samples (periods 5\u201317 demands used for forecasting). To keep the pipeline sized for service during the 1+L review horizon while limiting holding costs, I use recent_N (N=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the last 13 concluded demand observations. This targets responsiveness to the recent demand level and variance while relying on the confirmed 4-period lead time; with profit >> holding cost the backend will set a relatively high z service factor, but using recent statistics avoids overreacting to older low-demand samples. Given the large in-transit volume (418) plus low on-hand (16), these settings will let the backend cap orders appropriately and avoid excess additional arrivals while preserving service.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 context: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 385 units, promised lead time = 4. Historical demand samples (seed): [100, 69, 92, 77, 111], mean = 89.8 units/period. Given the concluded history, actual lead time has been stable at 4 periods (confirmed earlier), and recent demand shows no sustained regime shift (volatility and mean have fluctuated but not persistently). The pipeline (385) currently provides coverage roughly equal to 4.28 periods at the sample mean (385 / 89.8 \u2248 4.29) but on-hand is zero so upcoming periods will consume pipeline after arrivals. To keep the OR backend aligned with the promised lead time and the historical demand seed, I select default calculations so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (using the base-stock formula) against holding cost given the relatively high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). Using default keeps the policy stable and lets the OR engine account for the confirmed 4-period lead time and the full-sample demand statistics; I avoid aggressive reductions because pipeline coverage is only a few periods and demand has occasional spikes (e.g., periods with 100+ demand).

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 context: confirmed historical arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded arrivals show W=4). Recent demand history (Periods 1\u201319) has mean \u224884.95 units/period and std \u224822.61. With promised/confirmed L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods. Current on-hand + in-transit = 45 + 376 = 421 units. The default forecast (mu_hat default) = (1+L)\xd7mean_all \u2248 5\xd784.95 = 424.7 units, so pipeline + on-hand is slightly below the 5-period expected demand by ~3.7 units. I choose to (1) use calculated lead time so the OR engine uses the empirically observed lead-time average, and (2) use default demand and volatility computations so the OR backend produces a base-stock appropriate to the full historical sample. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given steady demand and confirmed L=4) against holding cost (current pipeline is already large). Using default sigma gives the backend the actual demand variability estimate to size safety stock through z*.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 context: confirmed lead time = 4 periods from past concludes. Recent on-hand = 9, in-transit = 359 \u2192 pipeline inventory = 368. Historical demand samples (seed) = [100,69,92,77,111], mean = 89.8 per period. With L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods and expected demand over that horizon \u2248 5\xd789.8 = 449 units. Current pipeline (368) is below that horizon forecast, so we should replenish to cover the (L+1)-period demand while the OR backend balances profit vs. holding cost. I choose to set L using calculated observed lead times (backend will compute average from concluded data, which is 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default formulas so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L) \u2014 conservative given no sustained demand shift and confirmed lead time. This gives the backend a baseline target (higher than current pipeline) to drive orders now and avoid stockouts while keeping holding-cost tradeoffs in its service-level formula.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22: observed on-hand=7, in-transit=386. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple conclude messages: orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Demand history shows no sustained regime shift (recent demands fluctuate but no >3-period consistent change). I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time=4 so the OR engine uses realized lead-time information. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default methods so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples\u2014this is appropriate because there is no clear recent regime change and using all samples stabilizes forecast and safety stock. With on-hand 7 + in-transit 386 the pipeline coverage is strong; choosing defaults prevents overreacting to short-term demand noise while the calculated L ensures orders cover the correct multi-period demand window given confirmed 4-period lead time. Holding cost is low relative to profit, so default stats with OR's internal z* will balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23. Demand history shows stable, single-regime demand with many concluded arrivals all indicating a 4-period actual lead time. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=464. With lead time confirmed at 4, the in-transit pipeline should cover roughly the next 4 arrival periods; no recent lost-shipment signal. I choose L by 'calculate' so the OR backend uses observed lead times (consistent 4). For demand forecast and volatility I choose 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively \u2014 this leverages all historical demand data and keeps the policy stable given no sustained demand regime change. These settings prioritize meeting service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while allowing the OR engine's capped order to limit excessive orders via its cap calculation.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 context: confirmed lead time = 4 periods (carry-over evidence). Current on-hand = 52, in-transit = 405. Recent concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals for many periods, no sign of lost shipments. Demand history in the environment and product (chips) shows moderate, stable demand with no detected regime shift. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and default demand aggregations so the OR backend computes base-stock using all available samples. Using default L ensures the pipeline coverage is (1+L) periods; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the supplied samples. This balances service level (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost by relying on backend's q-based safety stock calculation while acknowledging we already hold substantial in-transit inventory (405 units) that will cover upcoming demand.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 context: recent on-hand=27 and in-transit=384 (pipeline total=411). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=4). Demand history (seed samples mean=89.8 units/period) implies (1+L)=5 period demand \u2248449 units. Pipeline (411) is below the 5-period demand (~449) so the OR should place replenishment. Given the consistent evidence, I set L using 'calculate' (backend will compute average observed lead time = 4). For demand forecast and volatility I use the defaults so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances maintaining service level (covers multi-period demand under confirmed L=4) while letting the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff and cap constraints to avoid excessive holding cost.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 context: on-hand=50, in-transit=374 (total pipeline=424). Historical demand samples (seed) mean = 89.8 units/period (samples: 100,69,92,77,111). Promised lead time = 4 periods and concluded history consistently shows 4-period arrivals. Using L="calculate" will average observed lead times (all observed = 4) to set L=4. I choose mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (this yields (1+4)*mean and sqrt(5)*std). Rationale: pipeline (424) is slightly below the (1+L)-period demand forecast ((1+L)*mean \u2248 449), so the backend will size orders to move toward the base stock balancing profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1). Using defaults keeps forecasts anchored to full-sample demand while relying on the confirmed 4-period lead time; this avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations given a long lead time and substantial in-transit inventory. No evidence of lost shipments beyond the confirmed 4-period lead time, so no explicit adjustments to mu_hat/sigma_hat are warranted.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 context: confirmed historical actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence in concluded messages: all observed arrivals correspond to lead_time=4). Current on-hand = 78, in-transit = 353 (pipeline total = 431). Historical demand samples provided (5 samples: 100, 69, 92, 77, 111) give mean \u2248 89.8. With promised lead time = 4 and confirmed actual = 4, I select L based on observed lead times so the OR backend uses the empirically confirmed lead time. For demand forecasting I use the default full-sample rules: mu_hat default = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to capture 5-period aggregate demand (\u2248449 units). Pipeline (431) is slightly below that forecast, so ordering will top up toward the base stock computed by the OR engine. Sigma_hat uses the default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)) to reflect historical volatility. These choices are conservative: they rely on the full-sample statistics (no recent regime detected) and the confirmed lead time, balancing service level (cover 5 periods) against holding cost given profit/h holding cost ratio.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28 context: observed concluded lead times have consistently been 4 periods (many concluded arrivals show ordered Period t -> arrived Period t+4). Current on-hand=37, in-transit=389 (total pipeline+on-hand=426). Recent demand (Periods 23-27) = [70,113,104,99,104], recent mean = 98 units/period. With confirmed L\u22484, (L+1)=5 review+lead window. I choose L by 'calculate' to anchor the OR engine to the empirically observed 4-period lead time. For mu_hat I select recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (mean \u224898) and compute (1+L)\xd7mean = 5\xd798 \u2248490 \u2014 this anticipates demand over the next 5 periods and responds to the modestly elevated recent demand (period 24 spike included). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than the full-sample volatility; this gives the backend a recent-driven uncertainty estimate for safety stock. Rationale vs. inventory: pipeline+on-hand (426) is modestly below the 5-period forecast (\u2248490), so parameters will prompt ordering to restore the base stock while balancing profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) \u2014 using recent-driven \u03bc\u0302 raises target inventory to improve service and capture high profit per unit, while recent-driven \u03c3\u0302 increases safety stock for variability. Because lead time has been stable and confirmed at 4, I avoid longer explicit lead-time inflation. No evidence of lost shipments in recent history, so no explicit correction to L beyond 'calculate'.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded messages P5..P28 referencing orders placed 4 periods earlier). Current on-hand=23, in-transit=447. With promised lead time 4 and confirmed observations, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to ensure backend uses empirical lead time. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively \u2014 this leverages the full historical demand series to produce a stable base-stock given the long lead time and substantial pipeline. The large pipeline (447) plus modest on-hand (23) suggests we are well stocked for the lead+review horizon; using full-sample estimates prevents overreacting to short-term noise and balances service level against the $1 holding cost and $19 profit per unit.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30 context: on-hand=2, in-transit=389. Promised lead time is 4 and past concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (Period 6 insight). Recent demand (Periods 25-29) = [104, 99, 104, 81, 138] with mean \u2248105.2 \u2014 slight volatility and a one-period spike at Period_29 but no sustained new regime. Pipeline (391) is sizable but below (1+L)*recent mean (\u2248526), so it's prudent to size forecasts to the most recent 5 periods to reflect current demand level while keeping volatility estimates recent. Choices: L='default' (use promised lead time = 4, consistent with confirmed observations); mu_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to target the last-5-period average demand across the (1+L) review+lead horizon; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent demand variability. These settings help the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances high profit per unit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by focusing on recent demand signals and recent volatility, while relying on the confirmed lead time so the pipeline is interpreted correctly.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1192.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period: Period_31. Context: chips(Regular) has on-hand=43 and in-transit=423 (pipeline total=466). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (evidence in prior concludes), and recent pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers the expected (L+1)-period demand under the historical sample mean. Decision logic: set L using calculate to reflect the observed average lead time (observed lead times = 4 in concluded history). For demand forecast I use the default aggregation so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L) \xd7 mean(all samples) (with the provided 5-sample historical mean = 89.8 \u2192 mu_hat = 5\xd789.8 = 449 units across review+lead). Volatility: use default so backend computes sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L) \xd7 std(all samples) (std \u2248 15.21 \u2192 sigma_hat \u2248 34). Reconciliation vs. inventory: pipeline+on-hand = 466 vs. mu_hat \u2248 449, so current coverage slightly exceeds the (L+1)-period expected demand \u2014 this reduces stockout risk while keeping holding cost modest given holding=$1/unit. Using calculate/defaults lets the OR engine apply its capped ordering policy based on confirmed lead time and the historical demand moments; this balances high profit ($19) per unit (encouraging higher service level) against the low holding cost ($1) per unit-period.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 start. Observed history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded arrivals: orders placed at P1..P27 arrived after 4 periods). Current on-hand = 57, in-transit = 395 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to on-hand so outstanding supply should cover multiple future periods. Demand history (many periods) will be used by backend defaults. I select L via 'calculate' to confirm actual observed lead time from concluded messages (matches promised 4 but uses evidence). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all available samples; with a long history and stable demand this balances service level and holding cost. Using defaults avoids overreacting to recent fluctuations given sizable pipeline and confirmed stable lead time; it lets the backend produce the base-stock target and cap to limit ordering despite high pipeline inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Observed on-hand=66, in-transit=354. Profit=$19/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2192 high profit justifies maintaining service. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed in carry-over). Demand sample set (provided) has mean \u224889.8 over samples [100,69,92,77,111]. Given confirmed LT=4 and no recent demand regime change (no sustained shift in the last >3 periods), use the backend defaults so base-stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2175.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 context: observed steady actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed earlier). Recent on-hand = 10, in-transit = 414 (pipeline = 424). Historical demand samples show average \u2248 89.8 units/period (Period_1\u20135 baseline) and the environment has exhibited consistent demand without a sustained regime shift. With promised lead time = 4 and confirmed actual lead time = 4, I keep L at the default (promised) to align the OR engine with expected timing. I choose default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample history \u2014 this yields a base-stock target that covers (L+1) periods of demand. Rationale vs. missing shipments: recent history shows arrivals consistently at lead_time=4 (no prolonged losses), so no explicit lead-time extension is needed. Given current pipeline (424) is slightly below the (1+L)\xd7mean target (~449 from initial samples), the OR engine will order to refill toward the base-stock while capping order size via its cap. This balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by relying on the backend\u2019s service-level z* calculation.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35. Demand history shows stable regular demand around ~100 units (historical samples available to OR engine). On-hand = 74, in-transit = 393 (pipeline large relative to recent demand). Prior concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 6 carry-over). Given confirmed lead time and a healthy pipeline, I choose to use the default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies its full-sample mean/variance for base-stock and cap calculations. This avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations while the large in-transit inventory will naturally limit new orders via the capped policy. Defaults balance service level (using full-history mean) against holding cost since pipeline + on-hand already cover multiple periods of demand.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36. Current on-hand=31, in-transit=395 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed at Pn arrive at Pn+4 for many observations). I choose L via 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time (which is 4) rather than the promised default \u2014 this aligns with repeated conclude messages. For demand forecasting I use the defaults (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR engine computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full demand history; with profit=$19 and holding=$1 the implied service quantile is high, so the OR engine will produce a relatively large base-stock but capped by the engine's cap. Given the large in-transit inventory, this conservative choice prevents overreacting to short-term demand swings while letting the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost using complete historical demand statistics.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (Period 5 onward each conclude lists arrivals for orders placed 4 periods earlier). Current on-hand = 25, in-transit = 428 \u2192 total available = 453 units. Using L='calculate' (confirming observed lead time = 4) keeps the OR engine aligned with realized lead time. I choose mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the historical demand samples; this is appropriate because demand has been stable around ~90\u2013115 across many periods with no sustained regime shift requiring a recent_N or EWMA adjustment. With (1+L)=5, the default forecast will target approximately 5\xd7mean_demand (~5\xd790\u2248450), which matches current pipeline+on-hand (~453) and prevents large excess holding while preserving service. Using calculated lead time and default demand estimates balances high profit per unit ($19) against holding cost ($1) by letting the OR backend set the statistical safety stock (via z*) while capping orders per its cap rule.

Period 38 (Period_38) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38 context: confirmed historical actual lead time = 4 periods (evidence in conclude history). Recent inventory: on-hand=25, in-transit=398 => pipeline_inventory=423. Using the provided historical demand samples (Period_1-5 mean = 89.8 units/period) implies (1+L)=5 so expected demand over review+lead \u2248 5 * 89.8 = 449 units. Pipeline+on-hand (423) is slightly below that coverage, so the OR engine should place an order to top up. Given the clear and sustained evidence that actual lead time equals the promised 4 periods and no recent demand regime shift is evident, I select default methods so the backend uses all samples to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (avoiding stockouts given in-transit not yet observed) against holding cost using the OR engine's analytic base_stock formula. If arrivals continue to match promised lead time, defaults remain appropriate; if we observe a sustained change in demand or lead-time, we'll switch to recent_N or explicit estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $836.00

Period 39 (Period_39) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39. Demand context: historical sample mean (provided) = 89.8 units/period (samples: 100,69,92,77,111). On-hand = 95, in-transit = 401, pipeline_inventory = 496. Promised lead time = 4 and prior concluded history consistently shows arrivals with 4-period lead times (evidence in conclude messages). Given confirmed stable lead time of 4, I let the backend compute L from observed lead times (method 'calculate') so the OR engine uses empirical lead-time average. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples: with L=4 that yields a 5-period demand forecast \u2248 5\xd789.8 = 449 units. Current pipeline (496) already exceeds that forecast, so no immediate aggressive ordering is needed; this balances high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) by avoiding excess additional pipeline while preserving a healthy service level. Using backend defaults keeps parameterization conservative and aligned with observed stable demand/lead-time regime and lets the OR engine apply its capped ordering logic to limit order size.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. Current on-hand = 84, in-transit = 375. Profit per unit = $19, holding cost = $1/period. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed in earlier periods), so using the promised/default lead time is appropriate. Pipeline (375) plus on-hand (84) is large relative to typical period demand (~90-110), so aggressive extra safety stock is unnecessary; using default demand estimates (which pool all samples) lets the OR engine compute base_stock balancing profit vs holding cost. I therefore select default methods: L uses the promised/confirmed lead time, mu_hat and sigma_hat use all available samples so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps orders moderate (capped by the backend cap) and avoids unnecessarily high holding costs given ample in-transit inventory and high profit-to-holding ratio.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=93, in-transit=340. Promised lead time=4 and historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (Period 6 carry-over confirmed). Pipeline (in-transit 340 + on-hand 93 = 433) covers multiple future periods given typical demand. I choose L via 'calculate' to formally use the observed lead-time data (average of concluded lead times = 4). For demand forecast and volatility I select 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available demand samples: this is appropriate because there is no recent sustained demand regime change and the pipeline already provides strong coverage. These choices keep the base-stock linked to the long-run sample mean while the backend's cap will limit overly large orders; this balances service (high profit per unit) against holding cost given we currently hold substantial pipeline inventory. If future conclude messages show a sustained shift in demand or lead time, I'll switch to a recent_N or explicit method.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: chips(Regular) has on-hand=81 and in-transit=360. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded messages confirming L=4). Demand sample history (provided) has mean 89.8 units/period and moderate variability. Given the confirmed 4-period lead time, I set L explicitly to 4 so the OR engine will size the (1+L) review+lead demand forecast correctly. I select the default mu_hat and sigma_hat methods so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all provided demand samples (this uses the full sample set to stabilize estimates). This balances service level vs holding cost: profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1), so the backend's critical fractile will favor higher fill rates; using full-sample estimates avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the explicit L ensures pipeline coverage for 5 periods of demand (current + 4 future). Current pipeline (360) plus on-hand (81) appears sufficient for several periods vs sample mean demand, so defaults prevent over-ordering while respecting the confirmed lead time.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=90, in-transit=340, profit=$19, holding=$1. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed earlier). Pipeline inventory (90+340=430) is large relative to typical period demand, so we do not need an aggressive increase in target stock. I choose default lead time so OR backend uses the promised 4 periods. For demand forecast and volatility I choose default methods so the backend uses all historical samples to compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the base-stock policy stable given the sizeable pipeline and avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations; it balances service level (high profit justifies fill) versus holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the profit-driven z* with global demand statistics.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 context: on-hand=60, in-transit=408, confirmed lead time=4 (from prior insight). Recent full history shows consistent arrival pattern with lead_time=4 and no evidence of lost shipments. Base historical demand samples (used by OR backend) have mean \u224889.8 units/period, so with promised L=4 the (1+L) demand across review+lead \u2248449 units. Pipeline (468 units) already covers ~5 periods of expected demand, so no aggressive uplift is needed. I therefore use default methods so the OR engine computes base_stock from the long-run sample mean/variance and the canonical service-level ratio (profit/(profit+holding)). Using defaults keeps the backend model-aligned with observed stable lead time and avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations. This balances service (high profit per unit) against holding cost by letting the OR engine set the z* and cap based on the historical statistics.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. Demand has been stable with no recent sustained regime shifts in the observed conclude history (routine fluctuations around ~80\u2013115). On-hand = 64 and in-transit = 401 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is large relative to expected (L+1)-period demand so aggressive extra ordering is unnecessary. Lead time has been confirmed historically as 4 periods (consistent with carry-over note), so I use the promised/default lead time. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample-mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample-std using the full demand history; this leverages all available data and avoids overfitting to short-term noise given plentiful pipeline inventory. This balances service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost by letting the backend set the base-stock and cap using the empirical mean/variance while our inventory cushion (401 in-transit) reduces the need for higher safety stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1807.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46 context: on-hand=74, in-transit=368, profit=$19, holding=$1. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show orders placed on Period t arriving on Period t+4 (every concluded arrival indicates lead_time=4). Pipeline + on-hand currently large (74+368=442) relative to typical demand, but lead time=4 must be respected. I set L using 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed observed lead time of 4 periods (evidence: multiple concluded arrivals show W=4). For demand forecasting I use the backend defaults: mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this leverages the full historical demand sample set and the confirmed L to produce a base-stock that balances the high unit profit (driving service level up) against the moderate holding cost. Given the large in-transit inventory, relying on default mu/sigma lets the capped ordering rule avoid excess new orders while maintaining service over the 5-period coverage (current + L periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2384.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 context: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from historical conclude messages (multiple P arrivals show W=4). Recent on-hand = 48, in-transit = 365 \u2192 pipeline inventory = 413. Using the provided historical demand samples (100,69,92,77,111) the sample mean = 89.8. With promised/confirmed L=4 the review+lead horizon is (1+L)=5 periods, so the default forecast ((1+L)\xd7mean) implies demand over the horizon \u2248 5\xd789.8 = 449. The current pipeline (413) is slightly below that horizon demand, so replenishment is appropriate. I therefore use the default methods so the OR backend (which knows promised L=4) will compute base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302 and apply the capped order. Default choices keep parameter estimation stable (use full-sample mean/variance), rely on the confirmed lead time, and let the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1877.00

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48 context: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (carry-over from Period 6: P1 order arrived in P5, and subsequent concluded messages consistently show 4). Current on-hand = 61, in-transit = 380. With promised lead time = 4 and observed lead time = 4, pipeline + on-hand is large relative to single-period demand, so we should not inflate forecasts. Demand history shows stable variability over many periods with no recent sustained regime shift. Profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1) so the OR backend's service-level-driven base-stock calculation is appropriate. I therefore let the backend use the observed lead time average for L (so pipeline coverage is computed using actual lead time) and default demand statistics so it uses the full sample mean/variance to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat across the review+lead period. This balances high service level (capture sales) with low holding cost penalty by trusting the OR's z* tradeoff rather than manually increasing safety stock.

Daily Profit: $2033.00, Daily Holding Cost: $29.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $2004.00

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49 decision. Context: on-hand=29, in-transit=410 (pipeline total=439). Promised lead time=4 and historical conclude messages (Period 5 onward) consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 \u2014 current evidence confirms stable L=4. Historical demand samples provided (100,69,92,77,111) have mean=89.8; with (1+L)=5 the default forecast (1+L)*mean = 449 units over review+lead. Profit/holding ratio is very high (profit=$19, holding=$1) implying a target service quantile q\u22480.95 and thus a relatively large base-stock. Using default methods (promised lead time and default mu/sigma) keeps the OR engine aligned with its assumptions and leverages the long, stable lead-time signal. Pipeline + on-hand (439) is very close to the default (\u2248449) \u2014 I therefore keep defaults so the capped policy will top up small difference rather than trigger aggressive extra ordering. No recent changepoint in demand or lead time justifies deviating from defaults.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1995.00

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50 context: chips(Regular) has profit $19/unit and holding cost $1/unit/period. On-hand = 0, In-transit = 442. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals occurring with a 4-period actual lead time (orders placed in Period t arriving in Period t+4), so expected arrivals in the next several periods are contained in the in-transit total. Demand history across periods 1\u201349 shows fairly stable average demand with variability; recent periods include several high-demand weeks (e.g., Period_49 demand=144 consumed the full on-hand). Given the clear, sustained evidence that actual lead time = 4, I set L using the observed data (calculate) so the OR backend will treat lead time as the empirically confirmed value. For demand and volatility I select the default calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend uses the full history to compute base_stock and the capped order. This balances service level (high profit justifies higher fill rate) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the critical fractile and cap using comprehensive sample statistics. Using defaults also avoids overreacting to the single recent stockout (Period_49) while leveraging the large in-transit position (442 units) to cover upcoming demand during the 4-period lead time.
