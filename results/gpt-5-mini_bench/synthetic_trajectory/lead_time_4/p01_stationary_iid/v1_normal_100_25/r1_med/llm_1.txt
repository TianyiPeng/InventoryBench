Average = 89.8 \u2248 90 units/period. No evidence of a sustained shift (only 5 samples, variability but not a persistent new regime). c) Lead time vs. missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. No concluded arrivals exist yet, so actual lead time cannot be confirmed; treat promised LT=4 for ordering. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. With lead time L=4, decision rule requires covering (L+1)=5 periods of demand (current period demand will occur after ordering). Using forecast \u224890 units/period => required coverage \u2248 5\xd790 = 450 units. e) Final order logic: Place an order to cover 5 periods of expected demand to avoid stockouts given long lead time and no in-transit stock. This balances lost-sales risk vs. holding cost given profit margin ($4/unit) is materially higher than per-period holding cost ($1/unit); therefore err on the side of having stock to capture sales.",
