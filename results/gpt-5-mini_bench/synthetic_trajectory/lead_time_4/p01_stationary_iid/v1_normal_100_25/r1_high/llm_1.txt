Mean demand = (100+69+92+77+111)/5 = 449/5 = 89.8 \u2248 90 units/period. No sustained shift or change evident (only 5 samples, values vary but no persistent trend).\n\nc) Lead time & missing orders: Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods. No concluded arrivals or evidence of deviation; in-transit = 0 and no prior arrivals to infer an alternative lead time. Treat actual lead time as 4 until proven otherwise.\n\nd) Inventory & pipeline assessment: On-hand = 0, in-transit = 0. Because lead time = 4, an order placed now must cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods (current period plus four periods while waiting for arrival). Forecasted 5-period demand = 5 \xd7 90 = 450 units. Holding cost = $1/unit/period is small relative to profit $19/unit, so bias toward stocking to meet expected demand and avoid lost sales.\n\ne) Final order logic: Place an order to cover the expected demand over the lead-time horizon (L+1 periods). Order = 450 units to bring pipeline coverage to approx. five periods of forecast demand. Note: arrivals from this order will occur during Period 5 (ordered Period 1, arrive Period 5) and will be visible in the Period 5 conclude message at Period 6 start. No units can be available to satisfy Period 1 demand due to the 4-period lead time; this is unavoidable for the current period.",
