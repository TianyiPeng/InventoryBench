Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals exist to infer lead time; use promised lead time. Demand history (81,97,100,84,70) shows no sustained shift. Set L=default (promised 4). Use mu_hat default => (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to cover review+lead period and avoid understocking given zero inventory. Use sigma_hat default => sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect observed variability. This balances service level (high profit) against holding cost by relying on full-sample estimates until evidence of regime change or delayed/lost shipments appears.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=107 (ordered P1 but Period_1 conclude shows arrived=0). Observed demand in Period_1 was 103 (sold=0 due to stockout), which is one high demand observation versus historical samples. No concluded arrivals or multiple periods of delayed shipments to confirm a lead-time change, so keep promised lead time. Use default demand and volatility calculations to let OR engine apply full historical sample mean/variance with L=promised, avoiding overreaction to a single high demand period while the pipeline situation clarifies.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=218 (matches orders 107+111 placed in P1,P2); no concluded arrivals yet in history, so cannot confirm actual lead time or lost shipments. Promised lead time (4) is used to let OR engine apply its default review+lead calculation; use default demand/volatility aggregations (all samples) so base_stock reflects long-run mean from available historical samples while keeping pipeline coverage per promised L. This balances service level given a large in-transit volume against holding cost uncertainty until arrivals are concluded.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Concluded demands available for Periods 1-3: 103, 117, 118. No concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1\u2013P3 show arrived=0) so actual lead time is unobserved; use promised lead time. Demand appears stable across the last three concluded periods, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures current regime). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period demand forecast and recent volatility while not overreacting to limited history; default L keeps backend using promised lead time given lack of confirmed lead-time evidence.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=465 which matches total ordered (107+111+120+127)=465; arrivals occur during Period_5 and will only be visible in Period_6 conclude, so shipments are currently in-transit (not lost). Historical demand samples (P1\u2013P5): [81,97,100,84,70], mean=86.4. No sustained changepoint detected (only 5 periods, recent dip to 70 is single-period). Use promised lead time and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock and caps with full-sample stats: L=default to respect supplier promise and avoid premature extension; mu_hat=default to capture (1+L)\xd7mean demand across all samples; sigma_hat=default to reflect observed variability across all samples. This balances service level (covering 5 periods of demand) against holding cost given current in-transit coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2033.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start. Recent concluded history shows one arrival: Period_5 conclude: 107 units arrived (ordered Period_1) \u21d2 observed lead time = 4. Pipeline = 496 in-transit, on-hand = 0. Demand history (Periods 1-5): 103, 117, 118, 152, 136 (mean=125.2) \u2014 demand has been elevated recently. I set L to the calculated observed lead time (4) to reflect confirmed deliveries. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the (1+L) demand forecast reflects the latest 5-period mean (captures the recent higher demand levels). I keep sigma_hat as default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let OR backend use full-sample volatility scaled by lead+review period. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and recent high demand) while letting the backend cap orders to limit excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period_1 order arrived in Period_5; observed lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2109.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=0, in-transit=552. Historical sample mean demand (provided) = 86.4 over 5 samples. Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period_1\u2192P5, Period_2\u2192P6). Pipeline (552) is large relative to expected (1+L)*mean demand, so risk of holding cost is present; keep forecast and uncertainty anchored to full-sample statistics while letting OR engine cap orders. Selected L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=4; mu_hat and sigma_hat default to use all samples and (1+L) scaling so OR backend balances service level vs holding cost using observed lead time and historical demand stats.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2280.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: on-hand=0, in-transit=541. Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) available. Concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Pipeline is large so no aggressive up-front increase to forecast is needed. Use average observed lead time to match confirmed reality (L=4). Use default demand/volatility sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend computes base stock and cap from full-sample statistics and avoids overreacting to recent zero on-hand. This balances service level given high in-transit inventory against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2153.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_9. On-hand=13, in-transit=544. Lead time evidence: four concluded arrivals show orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived with lead_time=4, so actual lead time confirmed at 4. Recent demand (Periods 5\u20138 conclude) averaged 136.75 over 4 periods versus historical sample mean 86.4 \u2014 a sustained +~58% demand regime shift. To reflect this sustained increase, set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 4-period regime (captures elevated mean and volatility) so the OR engine raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 5-8: avg increased from 86.4 to 136.75 (+58.3%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $1689.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 10. On-hand=59, in-transit=574. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. Recent demand spike detected in Periods 5-8 (avg ~136.75) so use recent demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using L=default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals confirm promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (captures the 4-period elevated-demand regime) so the OR backend raises target inventory to cover the higher sustained demand while the large in-transit pipeline provides buffer vs. lost shipments.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11: confirmed lead time = 4 (carry-over). Recent demand regime (Periods 5-8) is higher: mean = 136.75 vs historical mean 86.4 (+58%). On-hand=139 + in-transit=511 = 650, which is slightly below (1+L)*recent_mean = 5*136.75 = 683.75, so we bias forecast toward the higher regime. Set L to promised/default (confirmed 4). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5-8). This raises target base-stock to cover the new higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures regime volatility and avoids understocking given some pipeline shortfall.

Daily Reward (R_t): $712.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: on-hand=200, in-transit=402. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent with Period_1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). Demand exhibited a confirmed regime shift in Periods 5-8 (avg 136.75 vs earlier 86.4), so I bias the forecast toward that recent higher-demand regime. Set L by calculate to use observed lead times. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to target the confirmed regime (Periods 5-8). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect volatility in that same regime. This increases order targets to protect service during the higher-demand regime while the OR backend balances holding cost via its cap.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: on-hand=266, in-transit=272. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 periods; no new sustained demand regime beyond previously recorded shift. Pipeline + on-hand (538 units) currently provides coverage for multiple (1+L)=5-period demand. Set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (avg=4). Use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014conservative choice given no new sustained pattern that warrants recent-only or explicit forecasting. This balances service level (use observed LT) against holding cost by avoiding overreacting to temporary spikes.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=366, in-transit=198. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods and no new late/lost shipments observed recently, so use promised lead time. There is a recorded demand regime shift earlier (Periods 5-8) but current on-hand is high; to avoid excess holding cost I choose conservative default estimators. L set to promised (default=4). mu_hat and sigma_hat set to defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (uses full-sample baseline of demand 81,97,100,84,70). This balances service level against high holding cost given current large on-hand inventory and in-transit units.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15: on-hand=410, in-transit=153. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (confirmed Periods 5-14). Recent demand after the earlier spike has moderated and shows no new sustained upward regime (variability present but no 3+ period sustained shift). Therefore use calculated lead time (use observed data) and use default demand moments (all samples) so the OR engine's base-stock leverages full history and the confirmed L=4 to balance service vs holding costs.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16 start. On-hand=326, in-transit=204. Previous conclude messages confirm lead time=4 historically; no new lost-shipment signal. Recent demand (Periods 11-15 = 48,64,68,60,84) averages 64.8 \u2014 a clear lower regime versus the earlier spike. I choose L=default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent). This reduces target base stock to avoid excessive holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: confirmed historical lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals show lead_time=4). Recent demand has fallen from the earlier spike: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 12-16) = [64,68,60,84,89], avg=73. Use L=default (promised 4) because arrivals have consistently matched promised lead time in the past. Set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to focus the forecast on the current lower-demand regime ((1+L)*mean_recent = 5*73). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent reduced volatility. This reduces over-ordering given high on-hand (237) and in-transit (204) while maintaining service for the short-term demand pattern.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=224, in-transit=110. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time=4 (seen repeatedly). Demand has been higher since Periods 5-8 (carry-over noted); to adapt to this sustained higher regime I use a recent_N demand estimate based on the most recent regime. Choose L=default (promised 4) because arrivals have matched promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (regime length ~Periods5-8) so the OR backend targets inventory for the elevated demand while avoiding excessive holding cost given current large on-hand stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1897.00

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19: recent realized demand has been higher than the original sample set (sustained higher demands in recent periods). Current inventory: on-hand=174, in-transit=168 (pipeline total=342) which covers several periods of recent demand; no new prolonged losses observed since arrivals resumed with consistent 4-period lead. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the confirmed actual lead time from concluded arrivals (observed = 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 7-period regime (captures the higher recent demand vs. early samples). This raises the base-stock to protect service while sigma_hat recent_N tightens safety stock to recent variability, balancing profit-driven service level against holding cost given ample on-hand + pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=118, in-transit=233 (pipeline=351). Promised lead time=4 and historical concludes confirm LT=4; demand has shown a past spike but recent periods settled around ~100. To balance service vs holding cost given sizeable pipeline, keep L as promised, use an EWMA for mu_hat to weight recent demand more (gamma=0.3) while using default sigma to reflect long-run variability. This reduces over-ordering from older low-mean samples while maintaining service.

Recent realized demand (Periods 15-20) = [84,89,107,109,107,74], recent mean=95.0. Given sustained higher demand earlier but recent six-period mean near 95 and substantial pipeline, I choose L=default to keep promised 4, mu_hat recent_N (N=6) to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and adapt to recent regime, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (captures recent demand uptick) while avoiding excess orders because in-transit inventory is already large and holding cost is low but nonzero.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:

Using recent demand captures the latest regime and avoids overweighting early samples. With L estimated from observed lead times and mu_hat based on the last 5 periods, the pipeline (486) roughly matches the 5-period demand forecast (~476), balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: on-hand=19, in-transit=423. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; pipeline is very large relative to on-hand and recent demand, so no immediate corrective increase in forecast or safety stock is needed. No new sustained demand or lead-time changepoint detected in the last 3+ periods. Use default promised lead time and default demand/statistics so OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD; this avoids overreacting to transient demand noise and leverages the large in-transit inventory to cover (1+L) periods of demand while keeping holding costs controlled.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24: on-hand=60, in-transit=450. History shows confirmed lead time = 4 periods (consistent conclude messages). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting around Periods 5-8 (carry-over insight). To reflect confirmed LT=4 I let backend calculate average observed lead time. To capture the higher recent demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=4 (regime length = 4 periods). This biases base-stock toward the elevated demand while sigma recent_N captures increased variability. The chosen params ensure pipeline+on-hand cover (1+L) periods of the higher-demand regime, improving service while keeping holding cost sensitivity via OR's z calculation.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_25 decision. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals). Current inventory: on-hand 116 + in-transit 296 = 412 units. Using historical sample baseline (provided samples mean=86.4 for base period) the (1+L)=5 period demand baseline = 5\xd786.4 = 432 units, so pipeline is slightly below coverage for 5 periods. Given high profit-to-holding ratio (profit $19 vs holding $1) we favor meeting service-level targets rather than cutting stock. I therefore use the default lead-time and demand/statistics methods so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap using the promised lead time and full-sample estimates; this leverages confirmed LT=4 evidence while letting the OR engine set the high service z-level appropriate to the high profit margin.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2091.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=75, in-transit=391. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple orders with W=4); pipeline (391) plus on-hand (75)=466 covers many periods of demand. No recent sustained demand regime change since prior insight (Periods5-8). Choose L by calculation to reflect observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, providing stable forecast given no new changepoint and large pipeline; this balances service level (high profit) against holding cost by leveraging observed demand stats rather than overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. On-hand=110, in-transit=363 (ample pipeline). Historical confirmed lead time=4 (carry-over). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime around Periods 5-8 (recorded previously); recent realized demands (Periods 23-27 = 75,98,80,114,108) better reflect current regime. I set L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time (4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime (N=5 chosen as recent stable window): this gives the OR engine a forecast based on latest demand behavior, balancing service level needs against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29 decision. On-hand=9, in-transit=428 (large pipeline arriving per confirmed lead time). Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent realized demand (last 5 concluded periods: P24-P28 demands = 98,80,114,108,101) gives a current mean ~100; with heavy pipeline I prefer to use a recent-window forecast to avoid over-ordering from older high-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target current demand regime and reduce excess holding while maintaining service given large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30. Observed on-hand=44 and in-transit=399 (ample pipeline covering multiple periods). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4; use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let OR backend apply long-run demand estimates; given large pipeline this avoids overreacting to short-term noise while balancing service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=63, in-transit=430. Historical demand samples (Periods1-5) mean=86.4; carry-over confirms lead time=4 and earlier demand regime shift (Periods5-8) but recent periods show demand around 88-106, not a sustained new shift. Pipeline is large relative to short-term demand, so use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates to let OR engine account for historical variability while avoiding overreacting to recent noise.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=58, in-transit=400. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand has been higher than the original sample mean; last 5 observed demands (Periods 27-31) = [108,101,106,88,120], recent mean \u2248104.6. To capture the higher recent regime while keeping responsiveness, set L to default (promised 4), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (covers higher recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33: on-hand=9, in-transit=443. Historical sample set (used by backend) is the provided Period_1\u20135 series; recent concluded periods show no new sustained demand or lead-time regime beyond earlier insights. Large in-transit position means we should not inflate forecasts; use default calculations so backend uses promised L and full-sample mean/variance to compute base stock. This balances service (high pipeline) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2219.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: recent demand regime (noted at Periods 5-8) shows higher demand; on-hand=4, in-transit=462 so pipeline is currently very large. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 historically; keep promised lead time. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, use recent_N for demand and volatility based on the most recent regime length (4 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean/variance while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period 35, on-hand=47, in-transit=458. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. Demand has been higher than initial sample mean; recent 5-period demand (Periods 30-34) averages ~106.8, indicating a sustained higher regime than the original small-sample prior. No evidence of lost shipments currently. Decisions: set L by 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead_time=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-demand regime and recent volatility, which increases target base stock and safety stock to protect service levels while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_36: on-hand=64, in-transit=455 (pipeline total=519) which is large vs. demand. Historical data shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Periods 5-8 (carry-over insight). Promised lead time and concluded arrivals consistently indicate a 4-period lead time, so use default L. To reflect the sustained higher recent demand and adapt the forecast away from the small-sample initial mean, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (N=5 using the most recent 5 demands) and match sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the proven higher-demand regime while allowing the OR backend cap to limit excessive orders given our large pipeline, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_37: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (carry-over). On-hand=70 + in-transit=423 = 493 units. Promised L=4; using default methods keeps OR engine's (1+L)\xd7mean demand anchor. The historical seed mean (samples) gives (1+4)\xd7mean \u2248 432 units, so pipeline + on-hand already roughly covers the target; avoid over-ordering by using defaults. No strong new sustained demand/lead-time signal to override defaults.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: on-hand=94, in-transit=378. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed repeatedly since Period_6). Demand history shows a sustained upward regime earlier (noted previously). To reflect confirmed lead time I use 'calculate' for L (backend will average observed lead times). For demand I'll use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the more recent higher-demand regime while keeping variability tied to recent samples. This balances service level (capture the higher recent mean) versus holding cost by limiting the horizon to recent demand instead of all-time average.

Demand has been elevated vs initial 5-sample priors; to reflect the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility (last N=5 periods) so the OR engine raises target stock while avoiding excessive holding given high profit margin.

Use conservative defaults tied to promised lead time so OR backend leverages full sample statistics; this keeps base-stock sizing stable given large pipeline and balances service vs. holding costs.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=46, in-transit=443. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4. A prior carry-over noted a sustained demand regime shift (Periods 5-8) to higher demand; to reflect that persistent higher demand while still smoothing noise, I choose recent_N=8 for demand mean and std to bias forecasts toward the new regime over the last several periods. Using recent_N captures recent higher average demand and variance, and with L=default (promised=4) ensures the OR engine sizes base stock to cover the review+lead horizon while avoiding excessive holding given the sizable pipeline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=23, in-transit=435. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has been in a higher regime since Periods 5-8 and recent periods show sustained elevated demand; using a recent-window forecast captures current mean/volatility. Set L to default (promised=4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on last 5 demand observations (captures current demand ~106.8 per period \u2192 mu_hat \u2248 5\xd7106.8). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand variability for safety stock. This balances service level (higher recent mean & volatility) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=41, in-transit=429 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods (confirmed earlier). No recent missing shipments. Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep OR assumptions aligned. Use default demand and volatility calculations (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because no new sustained demand regime change since prior insight; current inventory + pipeline already covers multiple periods so avoid aggressive up/down adjustments.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: recent demand has risen vs original sample mean (last 5 demands avg=108.8 vs historical 86.4) and lead time has been previously confirmed as 4. Current on-hand=49 and in-transit=402 (pipeline=451) which already roughly covers (1+L)~5 periods of elevated demand. Set L to promised/default=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher regime (reflects last-5 periods mean=108.8 \u2192 backend will compute mu_hat=(1+L)*mean). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices align safety stock to the higher demand regime while recognizing substantial pipeline inventory so OR cap limits will prevent excessive new orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2213.00

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46. On-hand=10, In-transit=464 => pipeline=474 which currently covers multiple periods of demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4, so use calculated L to reflect observed reality. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the seed samples; given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) this yields a relatively high base-stock to preserve service level while the large pipeline limits immediate ordering. No evidence of new demand regime or lost shipments since last conclude.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47 with on-hand=0 and in-transit=502. Historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4 (many arrivals labeled lead_time=4), and previous carry-over flagged a sustained demand regime shift (Periods 5-8 increase). To reflect confirmed L=4 I use 'calculate' so backend computes observed average lead time (will be 4). Demand is in the elevated regime since Period 9 and sustained through recent periods; I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts on the post-shift distribution (N=20 captures the recent sustained regime while staying within caps). This biases the base stock upward to meet high service level implied by profit/holding (q\u22480.95) while sigma_hat recent estimate captures recent volatility, limiting overstocks relative to using all-sample stats.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_48: on-hand=27, in-transit=462. Promised lead time is 4 and past conclude messages consistently show 4-period arrivals (confirmed earlier). Demand has been elevated vs initial 5-sample baseline; to focus the forecast on recent behavior I use a recent-window for mu_hat. L set to promised (default) since lead time has been consistently observed as 4. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=10) to capture the last ~10 periods of demand and adapt to the higher recent mean, improving service while avoiding excessive long-term overstock. sigma_hat left as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). No evidence of new sustained changepoint beyond previously recorded insights.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49. On-hand=66, in-transit=499. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. Demand has been in a higher, more variable regime since Periods 5\u20138 (carry-over) and recent demands (~Periods 29\u201348) remain elevated around ~100\u2013130. To reflect the sustained higher regime while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time, and compute demand forecast and volatility from the most recent data window to capture current mean/variance. Methods chosen: L kept as default (promised 4), mu_hat estimated from recent_N to target (1+L)\xd7mean of the last N samples (N=20) to reflect the current regime, sigma_hat from recent_N (N=20) to capture recent volatility.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Pipeline + on-hand currently provide substantial cover for (1+L)=5 periods. Therefore use the promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations, avoiding unnecessary perturbation given stable long-run pattern and to balance service level vs. holding cost.
