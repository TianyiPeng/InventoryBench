Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) = [81,97,100,84,70] (mean=86.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no 'Period 0 conclude' messages available to infer actual lead time or missing shipments. Promised lead time=4 periods. No evidence of demand regime change or lead-time shifts (insufficient periods/observations). Use defaults so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on full sample, balancing service level vs holding cost without overfitting sparse/no-confirmation signals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2. On-hand=0, in-transit=107 (ordered P1). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet beyond P1, so no evidence actual lead time differs. Historical demand samples available. To be conservative and let OR engine use full-sample stats with promised lead time, choose default lead time and default demand estimates so orders cover (1+L) periods of demand while respecting caps. This also avoids overreacting to a single missing arrival which may be on-time given promised L=4.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date Period_3. On-hand=0, in-transit=231 (orders placed in P1/P2 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals observed so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L). This keeps parameters conservative given uncertainty and existing pipeline while avoiding premature regime changes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision. On-hand=0, In-transit=353 (orders from P1:107, P2:124, P3:122). No concluded arrivals yet (arrived=0 for P1-P3), so shipments are delayed but actual lead time is not yet confirmed. Use L=default (promised lead time=4) because we have no concluded arrivals to compute actual lead time. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this keeps forecasts conservative while we observe whether in-transit shipments conclude. This balances service level (using full-sample demand stats) against holding cost given current large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (107+124+122=353 units) remain in-transit with no concluded arrivals through Period_3 \u2192 possible lead time > promised or delayed shipments; cannot confirm actual lead time yet.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=449, recent demand samples = [81,97,100,84,70] (mean=86.4). Four consecutive periods (P1\u2013P4) show zero arrivals for orders placed in those periods, indicating actual lead time exceeds the promised 4 periods (or shipments delayed/lost). To be conservative and ensure pipeline covers demand until arrivals materialize, I set L explicitly longer than promised. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) since demand shows no sustained regime shift. This raises the backend base-stock to cover (1+L) demand and trades off holding vs. service given equal profit and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained delayed arrivals: orders placed P1\u2013P4 (total 449 units) have not concluded after 4 periods \u2192 actual lead time > promised 4 periods (evidence: P1\u2013P4 conclude all show arrived=0).

Daily Profit: $107.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Recent concluded arrival shows order from P1 arrived in P5 with lead_time=4, so actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods. Demand in concluded periods P1\u2013P5: [124,95,66,93,120] (mean\u224899.6, elevated vs. prior baseline). With promised lead time 4 and confirmed actual L=4, set L using observed data. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated demand regime (use last 5 periods). This yields mu_hat based on (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 periods to cover review+lead demand, and sigma_hat based on sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 5 to reflect recent volatility. This approach addresses prior missing-arrival concerns by using confirmed lead-time evidence and recent demand to ensure pipeline + new orders aim to cover the next (L+1) periods without over-committing inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (order placed P1 arrived in P5: arrived=107, lead_time=4).

Daily Profit: $113.00, Daily Holding Cost: $11.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6). Demand sample mean across Periods 1\u20135 = 86.4 units. Current on-hand=11, in-transit=374 (pipeline large and will arrive per confirmed L=4). Use L calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed reality; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, giving a base-stock keyed to the full 5-period demand window. This balances service (profit and stockouts costly) against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5) and substantial pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=0, in-transit=342. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Several past orders were delayed but now lead time confirmed as 4. I choose L='calculate' to use observed lead times (reflects confirmed L=4). Demand forecast uses 'default' mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring ordering targets cover the review+lead horizon given confirmed lead time and current large pipeline. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high in-transit) vs holding cost by letting OR engine set safety based on overall demand variability.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_9. On-hand=0, in-transit=385 (several past orders now arriving on 4-period cadence). Concluded history shows orders placed P1\u2013P4 arrived with lead_time=4 \u2192 actual lead time confirmed. I choose L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed = 4). Demand has recently been higher than initial seed samples, but change is not yet being recorded as a sustained new regime; therefore use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given confirmed L=4 and current pipeline.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from history (orders placed P1\u2013P5 arrived with 4-period lag). Current on-hand=18, in-transit=385. Given confirmed LT=4 and no recent demand regime shift (recent demands ~100), use default settings so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This keeps forecasts anchored to full-sample demand while the pipeline (385) plus on-hand covers several periods; using defaults avoids overreacting to short-term noise and balances service vs holding cost.

I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, yielding a multi-period demand forecast that balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. This keeps orders sized to cover the 5-period demand window while the backend cap limits excessive single-period orders.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P9 concluded with W=4). Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135): [81,97,100,84,70] give baseline demand. Current on-hand=67, in-transit=361 (sufficient pipeline). Use L='calculate' to confirm observed lead time=4 from concluded arrivals; use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which aligns supply targets to the confirmed 4-period lead time and balances profit vs. holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15. Observed steady lead time = 4 in concluded history; on-hand=107, in-transit=349 (pipeline covers future demand). Use lead-time estimate from observed data to align replenishment timing. Choose L via calculate to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: on-hand=93, in-transit=335. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1..P11 arrived with W=4), so use observed lead time. Pipeline (335) + on-hand (93) covers multiple future periods. Choose L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period lag. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service level given equal profit and holding cost ($1/$1) and leverages full-sample stats rather than short-term noise.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=120, in-transit=308. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1 onward arrived after 4). Pipeline + on-hand appears healthy but demand samples (81,97,100,84,70) are the primary forecast anchor. I select L by calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed =4). I choose default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given confirmed 4-period lead time and no new sustained demand regime change.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: on-hand=95, in-transit=276. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show orders placed in P1\u2013P13 arriving after 4 periods (multiple 'lead_time was 4' conclude messages), so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (will be 4). Demand samples show no recent sustained regime shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base-stock while respecting the confirmed lead time and balancing service vs holding costs. This addresses prior delayed shipments by explicitly using observed lead time.

I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set \u2014 this leverages existing demand stats while the confirmed L ensures the base-stock covers the review+lead horizon.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20: on-hand=44, in-transit=373. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1..P15 arrived after 4 periods). Demand history shows stable variability without recent regime shifts. To align backend with observed lead time and use full-sample demand statistics, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat at their defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This ensures the base-stock covers the current review+lead period demand while using the engine's cap to limit over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current period: Period_21. On-hand=16, in-transit=381 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 for concluded orders (observed repeatedly since Period_5\u201320). Given confirmed actual lead time=4 and large pipeline, use lead-time estimate derived from observations and let the OR engine compute demand across review+lead using full-sample defaults to avoid overreacting to recent variability. This balances service (use observed L=4) against holding cost by not inflating the forecast or volatility estimates.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (e.g., order P1 arrived in P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). Current inventory: on-hand=8, in-transit=416 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=424. Using L='calculate' lets backend infer the confirmed 4-period lead time from concluded history. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (mean of samples = 86.4 \u2192 target inventory \u2248 5\xd786.4=432), which slightly exceeds current pipeline (424); this nudges ordering to cover the 5-period demand while balancing equal profit and holding costs.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_23: on-hand=48, in-transit=356. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 across many periods (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P18\u2192P22). Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) show stable levels (81,97,100,84,70). I therefore trust observed lead time signal and let backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample set; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1) and confirmed L=4.

I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (matches confirmed actual=4). Use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this yields a stable base-stock reflecting the 5-period review+lead demand and balances service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Use lead-time inference (calculate) to lock in observed behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, providing a stable base-stock level that balances $1 profit vs $1 holding cost given the confirmed L=4 and the sizable pipeline.

Demand seed samples available; no clear recent demand regime shift. Use promised/default lead time so backend uses L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let OR compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each). This keeps ordering conservative given zero on-hand but sizable pipeline (360) to cover upcoming periods.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 31 decision. Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed repeatedly since Period 5\u20136). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=413 \u2014 substantial pipeline consistent with L=4. I choose default lead time to match the promised/confirmed 4-period behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7historical std from all samples; this leverages long-run demand stats while the pipeline covers upcoming demand. This balances service (maintain coverage given large in-transit) versus holding cost by relying on base-stock computed from full-sample stats rather than reacting to short-term noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32 decision. Demand context: historical sample mean (periods 1\u20135) = 86.4 units; recent long history shows similar variability. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=402 (covers pipeline). Past concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. No recent lost shipments. I choose L=default to use the promised (and confirmed) 4-period lead time. I choose mu_hat=default so backend sets (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 5\xd786.4 (matches observed demand baseline). I choose sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples to capture observed variability. These defaults keep the base-stock anchored to the confirmed 4-period lead time and historical demand, balancing service level vs holding costs given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=421. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P32 that concluded indicate lead_time=4). Given confirmed LT=4 and no evidence of a recent demand regime shift, use lead-time estimate computed from observations and default demand aggregation over the (1+L) review+lead horizon so the OR engine applies its baseline base-stock with existing demand stats. This balances service (use observed LT) vs holding cost by not inflating demand or volatility forecasts without evidence.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: on-hand=0, in-transit=416. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show orders placed arrive after 4 periods (multiple concluded messages: e.g., P1\u2192P5 arrived=107, P2\u2192P6 arrived=124, etc.), so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. There are no recent demand regime shifts in the visible history. To reflect confirmed lead time and use full-sample demand stats, set L via calculate (use observed lead times), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps targets aligned with confirmed LT and avoids overreacting to transient pipeline fluctuations while the large in-transit position is present.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_35: recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (observed arrivals repeatedly labeled lead_time=4). Current on-hand=51 and in-transit=374. With profit=holding cost, target service level is 50% so use conservative baseline forecasts. Use lead time inferred from history (calculate). Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap with its statistical estimates given long, stable demand record. This balances stocking to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand while avoiding excessive holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=53, in-transit=367 (pipeline=420) which is ample for upcoming (L+1) demand. Choose L by calculating observed lead times to capture confirmed LT=4.

Period 37 (Period_37) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37: observed stable pattern with confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from concluded history; on-hand=106, in-transit=348 covers ~5.18 periods at recent sample mean. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed arrivals and defaults for demand stats since no recent demand regime change detected. L set to 'calculate' to anchor (actual) lead time; mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_38: on-hand=151, in-transit=308. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=4 (orders from P1..P33 arrived with W=4), so set L to calculated average of observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) because demand history shows no recent sustained regime shift and defaults align with confirmed lead time; this balances service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Given stable observed lead time and steady demand history, use calculated lead time to capture any small deviations, and default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies full-sample statistics and the capped-order logic.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41: on-hand=119, in-transit=261. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders from P1\u2192P5 etc.), so use observed lead time. Pipeline + on-hand covers multiple periods but maintain target covering (L+1) periods. Choose L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine computes base-stock and cap using full-sample statistics and the confirmed lead time.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=57, in-transit=327. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrived shipments with lead_time=4 \u2014 actual lead time confirmed. To align OR with observed reality I set L to 'calculate' (backend will compute avg observed lead times = 4). Use default demand estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Demand has been stable but variable; on-hand=0, in-transit=403. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained arrivals matching orders placed 4 periods earlier). To reflect confirmed lead time and use the engine's default demand estimates, I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps the policy aligned with observed lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=419. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed in Pn arriving in Pn+4), so use lead-time inference rather than promised. I select L='calculate' to lock in the observed LT=4. Demand samples (seeded by the provided historical samples) show stable mean/variance, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to observed demand while the LT estimate ensures pipeline coverage of (L+1) periods and mitigates lost/delayed shipment risk.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 shown earlier) average ~86. On-hand=1, in-transit=389 \u2014 pipeline is large. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods, so use promised lead time. Choose L: default (promised=4) to align OR engine assumptions. Choose mu_hat: default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, using full-sample average to smooth demand. Choose sigma_hat: default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps target base-stock driven by long-run demand estimates while relying on current large pipeline to avoid over-ordering given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=382. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, which matches promised lead time; no evidence of recent shipment losses. Demand history shows stable ~100 units/period. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and stable demand, use default lead time (promised=4) so backend uses its full-sample statistics for (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and substantial pipeline inventory.

LLM Rationale:

Demand history (seed samples) mean is 86.4; with L=4 the default mu_hat (=(1+L)\xd7mean) provides a 5-period demand cover. Use default sigma_hat to reflect observed variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices align pipeline coverage with the 4-period lead time and balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

To reflect confirmed lead time I choose L via 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times. Demand parameters use 'default' so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from all samples scaled by (1+L); this leverages the full history to smooth estimates and balances service level vs holding cost given profit = holding cost.

No recent demand regime shift detected. To let the OR engine compute the (1+L)-period demand forecast using full sample history and its cap, use calculate for L (to lock in observed LT=4) and default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps policy aligned with confirmed LT while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise and addresses prior delayed-arrival risk by reflecting the true lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 50: on-hand=0, in-transit=409. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders repeatedly concluded with lead_time=4). No evidence of lost shipments currently. Using default methods lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history, which is appropriate given confirmed L=4 and stable demand patterns; this balances service level vs holding cost when profit=holding ($1/$1).
