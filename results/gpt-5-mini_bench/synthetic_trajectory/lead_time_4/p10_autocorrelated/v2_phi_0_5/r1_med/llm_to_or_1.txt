Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical demand samples for chips(Regular) show mean = (75+138+134+122+111)/5 = 116.0 units/period. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population statistics: set L to default (promised 4). Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, capturing expected demand over review+lead. Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, reflecting observed variability. This conservative choice avoids overreacting to no arrival data while ensuring orders cover L+1 periods of expected demand given current zero inventory.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=158, no concluded arrivals yet (Period_1 order arrived=0). Promised lead time=4 and no observed lead-time evidence -> keep L as promised. Demand history samples (Periods 1-5) mean=116 units/period; using default (1+L)*mean produces a five-period forecast that covers current period plus lead time. Volatility unknown beyond samples, so use default sqrt(1+L)*std to let backend scale uncertainty. This choice ensures the OR engine targets a base stock covering (L+1) periods of average demand while accounting for observed variability; it also avoids overreacting to the single missing arrival which may reflect normal lead-time lag.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=315, two recent conclude messages show ordered shipments (Periods 1-2) have not yet concluded (arrived=0), so no confirmed change to actual lead time. Use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats: default L (promised), default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps policy aligned with historical demand while avoiding premature adjustments for possibly delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=475, three consecutive conclude messages (Periods 1-3) show ordered but arrived=0 \u2192 persistent overdue shipments. This suggests actual lead time may exceed the promised 4 or shipments are lost; to be conservative I extend lead time to reduce risk of future stockouts. I choose L explicit=6 to cover additional delay. For demand I use default aggregation (backend: (1+L)*mean of all samples) and default volatility (backend: sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR engine computes base-stock and cap using the extended lead-time window while relying on full-sample demand stats. This balances higher safety stock against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (ordered=158,157,160) have all arrived=0 at conclude \u2192 3+ periods of overdue shipments, indicating extended lead-time/lost-shipment risk.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 decision: recent on-hand=0, in-transit=630, demand samples P1-5 mean=116. Promised lead time is 4; several recent orders remain unobserved but not yet conclusively late given promised L (arrivals for early orders would occur during Period 5 and be visible in Period 6 conclude). To avoid overreacting to unfinished arrivals, use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default to set base-stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples)=5*116, sigma_hat=default to reflect full-sample volatility (sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)). This balances service level against holding cost while awaiting definitive arrival evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $187.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 start: recent conclude shows Period_1 order (158) arrived in Period_5 with lead_time=4, confirming promised lead time. Current on-hand=89, in-transit=472 \u2192 ample pipeline (561 total) vs. expected demand. Historical sample mean = 116 units/period; with L=4 the review+lead multiplier is 1+L=5. I choose L="default" to use promised lead time (now confirmed), mu_hat="default" so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures steady demand), and sigma_hat="default" to use overall volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps service levels appropriate given confirmed 4-period lead time while avoiding excess holding cost given significant in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period_1 order arrived in Period_5: ordered on Period_1, arrived Period_5 \u2192 lead_time=4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $389.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current Period 7: on-hand=119, in-transit=317. Historical demand samples mean=116 (periods 1-5). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6). Several earlier overdue arrivals flagged risk but two confirmed arrivals establish lead time at 4. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (will be 4). For demand forecast I use default (1+L)*mean of all samples => (1+4)*116 to capture demand over review+lead window. Volatility uses default sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples to reflect observed variability. These conservative defaults (anchored to confirmed L=4 and full-sample stats) balance service level against holding cost given confirmed longer lead time and remaining in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $341.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8. On-hand=155, in-transit=295. Historical concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1\u20133 arrived with lead_time=4 and Period 6 concluded explicitly confirmed lead_time=4; earlier multi-period overdue pattern resolved into confirmed L=4. Demand samples (all periods) mean=116 units; (1+L)=5 -> full-period demand ~580. I set L via "calculate" to have the backend use observed lead times (confirmed 4). I use "default" for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full history while the confirmed L and backend service-level math (high profit vs holding) will produce adequate safety stock without overcommitting given current pipeline. This approach also conservatively treats earlier missing shipments as resolved (no new sustained loss signal).

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent demand samples (Periods1-5) show mean ~116 units; on-hand=158, in-transit=271. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1-P4 arrived with W=4). No evidence of ongoing lost shipments. I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (will yield 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full-sample demand statistics (stable over 5 samples) and matches confirmed lead time, ensuring orders cover the (L+1) review+lead horizon while balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: on-hand=0, in-transit=430. Historical concluded lead times show consistent 4-period arrivals (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived after 4 periods) so I use observed lead time. Demand has stepped up since Period 5; recent demands (P5\u2013P9) average ~127.4 units/period. Pipeline (430) is below (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248 5*127.4=637, so we need replenishment. I choose L=calculate to lock in observed lead time=4, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new, higher-demand regime and reflect recent volatility for the OR backend.

Period 11. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=617 (sizable pipeline). No sustained demand regime change in available samples (period samples: 75,138,134,122,111). Use observed lead time average to match reality and default demand/volatility calculations to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this balances service vs holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived in P5\u2013P8; later arrivals also show 4). Demand samples (seed data) show moderate, stable demand; no sustained regime shift detected. Current on-hand=53 and in-transit=502 (large pipeline) so avoid inflating forecast. Choose L via calculate to use observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level with holding cost given substantial pipeline and confirmed lead time.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Current on-hand=87, in-transit=446; pipeline + on-hand covers several future periods but note an arrived=0 at P9 and small arrival at P10 indicating some variability in shipment quantities though lead time stable. I set L by calculation to reflect observed lead times (average ~4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand (samples mean = (75+138+134+122+111)/5 = 116) and balances service vs holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1.

Use 'calculate' for L to let backend confirm average observed lead time (matches promised 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full sample set while the confirmed L=4 ensures pipeline coverage for the (L+1) periods and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15: on-hand=244, in-transit=278. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders ordered on P1-P10 arrived after 4 periods). Demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean=116 units/period; with promised L=4 I use the calculated/confirmed lead time and default demand aggregation to match the OR engine's expected inputs. L set via calculate to reflect observed lead time=4. mu_hat uses default so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples)=5*116=580, capturing five periods of demand. sigma_hat uses default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect demand variability over the review+lead horizon. Using defaults with L calculated as observed 4 ensures orders cover the (L+1) periods of demand and aligns safety stock to profit/holding tradeoff while accounting for previously delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, and subsequent arrivals all show 4-period lag).

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods from prior concludes. Current on-hand=143, in-transit=345 \u2192 pipeline total=488 units. Historical sample mean (Periods 1-5)=116 units/period \u2192 (1+L)=5 \u2192 expected demand over review+lead \u2248580 units, so pipeline+on-hand currently short (~92 units). To reflect confirmed LT and use full-sample demand statistics, I ask the OR engine to compute L from observed lead times and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat (backend will set (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (capture ~5-period demand) vs holding cost while relying on confirmed LT evidence.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17: on-hand=77, in-transit=396. Historical conclude messages consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (confirmed across many arrivals), and there is no sustained demand regime change in the five-sample demand history (samples: 75,138,134,122,111; mean=116). I therefore let L be inferred from observed lead times (calculate) so backend uses confirmed lead time=4, and use full-sample demand statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat (default) so the base-stock reflects (1+L) periods of demand and historical variability. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given current pipeline and no new significant signals.

I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirms 4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples \u2014 a conservative choice given stable demand history and confirmed lead time; this balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost.

Demand history provided (samples seed) appears stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine determine base stock while accounting for the 4-period pipeline.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=554. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time (confirmed earlier). Recent demand (Periods 15-19 = 124,141,169,146,119) averages ~139.8, higher than earlier sample set \u2014 recent uptick sustained over 5 periods. Pipeline (554) is below (1+L)*recent_mean (5*139.8\u2248699), so parameters should target the recent higher demand to avoid stockouts while acknowledging holding cost. I set L to default (promised 4) because lead time has been consistently 4; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher mean and volatility observed in the last 5 periods, improving service at modest holding cost tradeoff.

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:

Period_21: observed stable confirmed lead time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals show 4-period lag). On-hand=8, in-transit=601 \u2014 large pipeline covers many future periods but recent ending-on-hand is low so maintain standard forecasting. Use default lead time (promised=4, confirmed by history). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level and holding cost given confirmed L and large pipeline.

On-hand = 78, in-transit = 486; pipeline plus on-hand covers several future periods but demand samples (Period_1\u20135) have mean 116. Promised lead time remains appropriate so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect long-run average demand (stable recent pattern) and default sigma_hat to reflect full-sample volatility. These settings let the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while respecting the 4-period lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 23 (Period_23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23. Recent confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (historical concludes show consistent 4-period lag). Demand samples mean = 116 units/period (samples: 75,138,134,122,111). On-hand=152 + in-transit=389 => pipeline inventory=541, while (1+L)*mean = 5*116 = 580, so pipeline is ~39 units short of covering the next L+1 periods at historical average. To respect confirmed lead time and avoid understock, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma from full-sample variance; this balances service level given profit/holding tradeoff while letting the OR engine cap orders.

On-hand=178, in-transit=335; recent conclude history consistently shows a 4-period arrival lag (confirmed across multiple periods), so use the promised lead time. No sustained demand regime shift detected. I choose L default (promised=4) so OR uses standard lead time; mu_hat default to capture (1+L)*mean across all samples = 5*116; sigma_hat default to let OR compute volatility from all samples. This balances service (maintain coverage over review+lead periods) versus holding cost given moderate on-hand and ample in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P22\u2192P26), so set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 4). Demand history samples (75,138,134,122,111) have mean=116; using default mu_hat (=(1+L)*mean) preserves the long-run demand estimate across the review+lead horizon. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). Current on-hand=133 and in-transit=371 provide substantial pipeline coverage; parameters chosen prioritize service (profit=4 vs holding=1) by basing base-stock on long-run mean while letting OR backend cap orders to control overstocks. No recent anomalous lost-shipment pattern beyond the already-confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=85 and in-transit=398 => pipeline (on-hand+in-transit)=483 units, which provides coverage vs expected demand when using the backend's default demand estimate. No recent sustained demand regime change detected; use defaults so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), and promised lead time=4 is honored.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=36, in-transit=437. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lag (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6 ... up to P24\u2192P28), so use observed lead time. Recent demand has trended around 100\u2013150; last 5 concluded demands (P24\u2013P28 = 80,109,116,137,150) average 118.4. Set L via calculate (observed lead time=4). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime: (1+L)*mean_recent = 5*118.4 \u2248 592. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align pipeline coverage for the 5-period review+lead horizon while avoiding overreaction to older samples; large in-transit (+437) will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing order quantity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $440.00

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=526. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (established earlier). Pipeline (526) covers several periods but on-hand is zero so we must replenish for (1+L) review+lead demand. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime (Periods 25-29 demands: 109,116,137,150,113) so the forecast and variability reflect current demand levels rather than the small early-sample prior. These parameters bias the OR backend toward meeting near-term service (higher mu_hat from recent demand) while sigma_hat from recent data sets safety stock; this balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) by focusing on recent demand rather than older low-sample estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $373.00

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31. Lead time historically and repeatedly observed = 4 periods (confirmed in prior concludes). Current on-hand=11, in-transit=552 (large pipeline). Demand history (seed samples) mean=116 units/period; with L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods. To balance service level (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1), I use default estimates so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the validated 4-period lead time and the full-sample demand stats given the large in-transit pipeline and no new sustained regime change.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: chips(Regular) profit $4, holding $1. On-hand=13, in-transit=498. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (confirmed through Period_15 onward), which matches the promised lead time. Pipeline (13+498) is large relative to recent demand samples (mean=116), so use default demand/volatility calculations based on promised lead time=4 to let the OR engine compute base stock and cap from full-sample statistics. This balances service level (using confirmed L=4) with holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_33: recent history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (multiple conclude messages P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6,... P28\u2192P32). Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) have mean=116 units/period; current on-hand=43, in-transit=471 (pipeline covers multiple future periods). Given confirmed stable lead time and no recent demand regime shift, use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps policy aligned with observed 4-period arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost using historical aggregate demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $374.00

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: demand context uses available sample mean (historical sample mean=116 units/period). On-hand=90 + in-transit=417 = 507 units in pipeline. Promised lead time=4 and concluded history consistently shows actual lead time=4 periods, so use a lead-time estimate reflecting that. With L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods and expected demand over that horizon \u2248580 units (5\xd7116), so current pipeline (507) is ~73 units short \u2014 OR should order to replenish. I choose default demand/volatility methods so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples; L set to calculate so backend will confirm average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. This balances service level (cover 5 periods) against holding cost by relying on backend's z* and cap computations while acknowledging slightly under-pipeline position that will trigger an order.

Given confirmed stable lead time and no recent demand regime shift, use calculated lead time (averaged observed = 4) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over samples. This keeps the backend safety stock aligned with observed 4-period lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise; adequate pipeline (399) plus on-hand covers upcoming demand but defaults ensure continued service-level orientation vs holding cost.

Current on-hand=84, in-transit=377 \u2014 pipeline is substantial (covers multiple periods). Use default lead time (promised=4, confirmed by concludes) and default demand/statistics so backend uses full-sample mean and variance ((1+L)\xd7mean to size base stock). This keeps ordering aligned with long-run demand signal and leverages large in-transit inventory to avoid overreacting to short-term swings, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40 decision. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P35\u2192P39 confirmations). On-hand=43 and in-transit=442 (pipeline adequate vs expected 4-period coverage). Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4. Use default demand estimates (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all provided samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) because no recent sustained demand regime change is evident from the supplied samples; this balances service level with holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41. Recent concluded history shows a stable confirmed lead time of 4 periods and demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) have mean=116 units/period. On-hand=15, in-transit=497 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=512 vs default (1+L)*mean = 5*116=580, implying a shortfall of ~68 units over the review+lead horizon. No new prolonged delays observed; use conservative defaults so OR backend (which knows promised L=4) computes base-stock and caps appropriately given high service target (profit $4 vs holding $1). Chosen methods rely on full-sample statistics to avoid overreacting to short-term noise and to let the OR engine handle safety-stock sizing.

Use promised/confirmed lead time to let OR backend compute base stock from full-sample mean and variance so orders cover (1+L) periods of demand; default mu/sigma let engine leverage all historical samples and the capped order rule to balance service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_43: recent concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time. Recent demand (Periods 38-42 = 152,134,109,132,120) averages ~129.4. On-hand=3, in-transit=498 (large pipeline). Use L inferred from concluded data; set demand forecast based on recent 5-period mean to reflect current regime and avoid overshooting given large pipeline. This balances service (use 5-period demand \xd7 (1+L)) vs holding cost by relying on recent demand and existing high in-transit stock.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=0, in-transit=496. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period lag (multiple P->P+4 confirms actual lead time=4). I choose L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (which will average \u22484). Use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages full historical demand given no recent sustained demand regime change. This balances service level (capturing lead-time demand) against holding cost while accounting for large in-transit volume already en route.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45. Demand samples recent mean = 116 (samples: 75,138,134,122,111). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; use promised/default lead time. On-hand = 4, in-transit = 492 \u2014 pipeline is large. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level given high pipeline while respecting holding cost.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand history is stable around ~120 units/period (no recent sustained regime shift). With zero on-hand and substantial pipeline, use conservative defaults so OR backend uses full-sample demand stats scaled by (1+L). Default L keeps consistency with observed LT; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let OR compute base_stock and cap from full historical samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47: on-hand=0, in-transit=535. Historical conclude messages consistently show a 4-period arrival lag (many P\u2192P+4 confirmations), so set lead time by observed data. Use L=calculate to let backend confirm average observed lead time (effectively 4). Demand samples (provided) have mean=116; with L\u22484 the default (1+L)\xd7mean gives a forecast covering review+lead period. Volatility will use default scaling sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to reflect uncertainty over the multi-period pipeline. This keeps the OR base-stock anchored to observed mean demand while the calculate L accounts for confirmed 4-period lead time; defaults balance service level vs holding cost given no recent regime shift evidence.

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_50: recent historical demand samples mean=116 (samples:75,138,134,122,111). On-hand=120 + in-transit=412 => pipeline=532. Promised lead time=4 and historical concludes consistently confirm 4-period lead time. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (matches observed). Use mu_hat=default so backend sets target = (1+L)*mean_all = 5*116 = 580 (ensures pipeline aims to cover five periods of demand). Use sigma_hat=default so backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies moderate safety stock) while acknowledging a stable 4-period lead time and current pipeline of 532 which is slightly below the 580 demand-on-review+lead forecast.
