Current pipeline (in-transit 403 + on-hand 0) covers most of that but is \u224897 units short of the rough 5-period need.

Step 4 \u2014 Risk/financials: Profit $4 vs holding $1 means higher weight on avoiding stockouts; OR's base-stock approach already accounts for this. Given large in-transit volume and no confirmed lead-time issues, avoid aggressive up-adjustment to limit holding cost.
