Ordering this brings pipeline+order up to expected demand over the next 5 periods without adding extra safety stock that would increase holding costs. 5) Tradeoff: full OR base_stock (\u2248134 order) would add substantial inventory and holding cost; given current large pipeline and moderate demand uncertainty, ordering to meet expected demand (64) balances stockout risk and holding cost.
