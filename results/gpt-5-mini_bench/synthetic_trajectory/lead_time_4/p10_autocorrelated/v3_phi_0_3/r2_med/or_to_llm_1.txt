Break down pipeline ETAs: P43 order 201 arrives in Period 47, P44 order 114 arrives P48, P45 order 175 arrives P49, P46 order 0 arrives P50. Current available now = on-hand 67; scheduled arrivals over next (L) periods = 201+114+175+0 = 490, so total available through the next 4 arrival epochs = 557. Because demand this period also occurs after arrivals, total supply available to meet the upcoming (L+1)=5 periods of demand is 67 (on-hand) + 201 (P47 arrival) + 114 (P48) + 175 (P49) + 0 (P50) = 557 \u2014 which will be drawn down over the next 5 periods. Estimated demand: recent regime shows elevated/variable demand around ~120\u2013135 units/period (using Periods 42\u201346 as reference), so 5-period demand \u2248 600\u2013675. However, recorded historical demand includes some lost sales (Period 45) and pipeline is large; more conservatively, using single-period mean ~120 \u2192 5-period demand \u2248600. Pipeline+on-hand (557) is close to needed volume; given high in-transit already committed, ordering now would arrive after the 4-period lead (beyond several upcoming arrivals) and would create extra holding cost while offering little marginal stockout protection. OR's recommendation (43) is unnecessary because it ignores actual in-transit detail; placing an order now would mainly increase holding costs before additional needed consumption. Therefore I place no order this period to avoid excess holding cost while relying on imminent arrivals to satisfy demand. If upcoming realized demand exceeds expectations (sustained >135/period) I will record a carry-over insight and resume ordering earlier.",
