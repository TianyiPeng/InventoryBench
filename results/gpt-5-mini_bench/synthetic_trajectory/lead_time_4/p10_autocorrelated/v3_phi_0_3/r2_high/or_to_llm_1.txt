Recent realized demand (most recent 5 periods P44\u2013P48) averages ~94.6 units/period \u2192 5-period demand \u2248 473 units. Even using the higher regime average noted earlier (P42\u2013P46 avg=131.2 \u2192 5-period \u2248 656), current visible receipts/pipeline are large but recent actual sold volumes have dropped (P47\u2013P48 low), and many in-transit units will arrive as scheduled. OR recommendation = 62 (uses promised L and historical samples); I override downward because pipeline + on-hand (585) comfortably covers 5 periods at recent demand (\u2248473), so additional ordering risks unnecessary holding cost.
