Recent realized demand has averaged roughly 100\u2013120 units in recent windows; even using conservative 120\xd75=600 is close, but in-transit=509 already provides large pipeline coverage and many arrivals have been consistently arriving with 4-period lag. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) so overstocking is costly. OR's tiny recommendation (6) ignores our large pipeline.
