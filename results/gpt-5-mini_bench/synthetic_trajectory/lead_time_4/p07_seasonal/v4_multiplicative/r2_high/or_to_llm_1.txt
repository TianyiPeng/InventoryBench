  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: e.g., P1\u2192arrived P5). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 260, in-transit = 157 (these in-transit units will arrive after 4 periods and are already in pipeline). Demand outlook: recent realized demand has risen from the low-60s regime to roughly 100-ish since Period 29 (carry-over insight already recorded). Last concluded period demands: P44=126, P45=105, P46=102, P47=31 (variability present but no indication of a large, sustained spike that would deplete current heavy inventory). OR baseline (164) assumes placing orders to top up pipeline using promised lead time; given actual lead time=4 and large on-hand + pipeline (417 total), ordering more now risks high holding cost. Profit per unit ($19) is high, but holding cost ($1/period) multiplied by many units over remaining short horizon (Periods 48\u201350) will erode returns, and there are only 3 periods left. Strategy: do not order this period (order = 0). This preserves on-hand stock to satisfy anticipated demand while avoiding additional holding cost and potential overstock by the time orders with 4-period lead arrive (which would be after the game ends).
