Step 3 \u2014 OR recommendation: OR recommends 112 units, but that would push pipeline above the 5-period expected demand.

Calculation intuition: if true single-period demand is between 80\u2013120, 5-period demand is 400\u2013600. Current pipeline 422 already covers the low end (~80\xd75=400) and is close to mid-range, so a full OR quantity risks excess ending inventory and holding cost.
