Ordering ~95\u2013165 would make sense by different risk tolerances; OR proposed 107, which closes most of the shortfall while keeping holding costs moderate (holding=$1/unit/period) and profit/hard-service fractile (q=0.8). Step 4 \u2014 Decision: follow OR recommendation of 107 units. This replenishes the pipeline to roughly match the (L+1)-period demand without creating excessive holding cost given already-large in-transit volume.
