Current state: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 150 (these are undelivered; next arrival from Period_49 order will occur at Period_53). Orders placed now (Period_50) would arrive in Period_54. Demand outlook: recent periods show a downshift from prior highs (Period_41\u201349 demands: 58,89,63,55,37,78,83,43,105 \u2014 average ~71 over last 9 periods), and historical carry-over notes show multiple regime shifts; no new sustained surge is evident. OR recommends 169 but uses promised lead time and full history; it ignores current pipeline. Requirement: because of long lead time, we should avoid adding inventory unnecessarily given substantial in-transit stock and elevated holding cost ($1/unit/period vs $4 profit). Risk: we cannot prevent shortages in immediate next few periods (arrivals only at P53), but ordering now would create additional holding cost for later periods if demand remains moderate. Decision: place 0 units. This relies on arriving 150 units to cover upcoming demand; we will reassess in subsequent periods once arrivals conclude and true pipeline + demand for the new regime are visible.",
