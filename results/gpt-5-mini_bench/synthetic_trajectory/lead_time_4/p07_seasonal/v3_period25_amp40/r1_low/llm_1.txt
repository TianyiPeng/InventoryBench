Ordering now cannot help Period 3 demand because supplier promised lead time is 4 periods (orders placed now would arrive much later), so any new order will not affect immediate sales but will increase future holding costs. Profit per unit sold = $1 and holding cost = $1/period, so excess inventory is very costly. Inventory assessment: on-hand=0 so current period sales will be lost if arrivals do not occur; however the existing large in-transit of 790 suggests a high probability of ample future supply and high holding cost risk if we add more.
