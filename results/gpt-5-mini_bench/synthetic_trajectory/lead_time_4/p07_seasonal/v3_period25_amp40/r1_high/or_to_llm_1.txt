Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=280, in-transit=397 => total supply now = 677 units. Recent sustained demand regime is the higher regime that began around Period 29 (avg \u2248154 over P29\u201333 and continued through P34\u201337 with demands 122,112,89,110). Conservatively use avg demand \u2248130\u2013150 per period; remaining demand periods = Period 38..50 = 13 periods. Projected remaining demand \u2248 13 \xd7 130 = 1,690 units (conservative lower bound) to 13 \xd7 150 = 1,950. Orders placed now arrive in Period 42 (covering P42..P50); current supply (677) will cover the next ~5 periods (L+1=5). To cover the full remaining horizon, deficit \u2248 1,690 \u2212 677 = 1,013 units (using lower bound). Given high profit ($19) vs holding $1 per period and large remaining selling horizon, stocking additional units is profitable even accounting for holding over several periods. Action decision: order 1,000 units now to replenish pipeline so arrivals in P42 increase available supply for later high-demand periods; this roughly closes the ~1,013-unit deficit while avoiding excessive overstock. Adjustment vs OR: OR recommended 19 units (uses promised L and long historical averaging); I override because actual lead time=4, demand is in a higher regime, and current pipeline/on-hand are large but still insufficient for the full remaining horizon. Risk notes: if actual future demand falls back below ~100, this order could increase ending inventory and holding costs, but current evidence favors the higher-demand regime.",

Holding cost is $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit; with no replenishment possible before horizon end, placing orders only increases holding cost (and would never arrive).
