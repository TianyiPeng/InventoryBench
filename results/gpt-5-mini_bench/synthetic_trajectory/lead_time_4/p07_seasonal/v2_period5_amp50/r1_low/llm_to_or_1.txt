Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_4\p07_seasonal\v2_period5_amp50\r1_low\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 137), ('Period_2', 92), ('Period_3', 110), ('Period_4', 43), ('Period_5', 128)]
  Mean: 102.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start with no on-hand or in-transit and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Promised lead time is 4. Historical demand samples (137,92,110,43,128) will be used as the baseline; no sustained changepoint or lead-time evidence exists yet. Use default lead time and default demand moment estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding costs given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=164 (order placed in P1). No concluded arrivals yet beyond Period_1 (arrived=0 in P1 reflects no same-period arrivals). Promised lead time=4 has no contradictory evidence, so keep L=default. Demand history (samples provided) shows no sustained regime shift; use default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost by using the backend's base-stock calculation with full-sample estimates while monitoring for future arrival/lead-time evidence.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=328; two consecutive conclude messages show ordered arrivals=0 (Period_1 and Period_2 orders did not conclude). No concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time or confirmed lost shipments. Use default lead time (promised L) to avoid premature adjustment. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasts pooled across available data while the arrival pattern clarifies. This approach balances service level (uses full-sample demand) and holding cost conservatively given uncertain shipments.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=489, recent concluded arrivals=0 for orders placed in P1\u2013P3 so no concluded lead-time observed; promised lead time=4 still best default. Demand history (provided samples 137,92,110,43,128) shows no confirmed sustained regime shift. Several earlier orders appear delayed (arrived=0) so I avoid shortening/lengthening L without concluded evidence. Use default L so backend uses promised lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), keeping policy conservative given high in-transit volume and equal profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: on-hand=0, in-transit=504 (matches sum of orders placed P1-4). History shows no concluded arrivals for orders placed in P1\u2013P4. I will use default lead time (promised = 4) because concluded messages do not confirm a different actual lead time. Demand samples: [137,92,110,43,128], mean=102. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std so orders target coverage for the review+lead horizon while the capped policy limits over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline. This balances service level against holding cost given current uncertainty about arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: 504 units ordered across Periods 1\u20134 remain in-transit with no arrivals by Period_4 conclude; possible lost or delayed shipments.

Daily Profit: $84.00, Daily Holding Cost: $80.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $4.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 context: observed demand samples (137,92,110,43,128) mean=102. Recent conclude shows Period_1 order (164) arrived in Period_5 \u2192 observed lead time = 4 for that order. Current inventory: on-hand=80, in-transit=340 (matches orders from Periods 2\u20134 totaling 340 still undelivered). Given one confirmed 4-period lead time and continued missing arrivals for later orders, use calculated lead time based on observed concludes to reflect actual behavior. Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let backend compute base-stock while accounting for 5-period coverage; this balances service (higher coverage for L=4) against holding cost given equal profit and holding. Keeping demand/statistics defaults is conservative until more concluded arrivals confirm a structural demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period_1 order arrived in Period_5); Orders from Periods 2\u20134 totaling 340 units remain in-transit with no arrivals by Period_5 conclude (possible lost/delayed shipments).

Daily Reward (R_t): $72.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 decision. Recent demand samples (Periods 1\u20135 = 137,92,110,43,128) give mean=102. On-hand=86, in-transit=210; arrivals from Periods 3\u20135 are still expected in future periods, but concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4 (Period_1\u2192Period_5, Period_2\u2192Period_6). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time (4) so the OR engine sizes orders to cover (1+L) periods. Demand forecast uses 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect full-sample demand given no sustained regime change; sigma uses 'default' to reflect historical volatility. This balances service (use observed lead time) vs. holding cost by relying on full-sample estimates until a sustained shift is evident.

Daily Reward (R_t): $21.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 decision. Recent demand has risen (Period_6\u20137: 158, 134) but overall history is mixed. On-hand=113, in-transit=219; orders from Periods 1\u20133 confirmed with lead_time=4 (arrivals in Periods 5\u20137), so actual lead time is consistently 4; some earlier small orders remain overdue but arrivals since Period_5 show the 4-period lead is reliable. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (captures confirmed 4). I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given confirmed lead time and mixed recent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-18.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: recent concluded history shows orders from Periods 1\u20134 all arrived with lead_time=4, confirming actual lead time = 4. On-hand=73, in-transit=372 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to on-hand so no evidence of new lost shipments since Period_6. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 4). For demand I use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = default so the backend scales variance by sqrt(1+L). This keeps target base-stock aligned with the confirmed 4-period lead time and uses full-sample averages to balance service level vs holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent demand (Periods 5\u20139) elevated/variable (84,158,134,55,72; mean\u2248100.6) and lead time has been observed as 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=1, in-transit=410 (large pipeline but some earlier shipments were delayed/lost historically). To balance service vs holding cost I set L by observed lead times (calculate) and use a recent-window forecast (recent_N N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the latest demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand samples. This keeps service high given pipeline uncertainty while controlling excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit/period.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 11. Recent demand samples: [137,92,110,43,128]. On-hand=0, in-transit=468 \u2014 substantial pipeline but prior periods showed delayed/lost shipments; observed lead times from concluded arrivals consistently 4 periods. I choose L=calculate to let backend confirm actual lead time from observed concludes (expected ~4). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1) and the confirmed multi-period lead time. This approach keeps orders conservative while accounting for the long lead time and existing in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11). On-hand = 21, in-transit = 299 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand = 320 units. Historical sample mean (Period_1\u20135) = 102 units/period, so (1+L)=5 \u2192 expected demand over review+lead \u2248 510 units; current pipeline is short versus that coverage. I therefore confirm lead time via observed arrivals (use calculate) and rely on the default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap using the full-sample statistics to restore coverage while letting the optimizer balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) have mean 102 units. On-hand=59, in-transit=348 \u2014 pipeline is large but some earlier shipments were delayed/lost; however multiple later concludes confirm lead_time=4 so use observed lead time. Set L by calculating average observed lead times (gives 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, yielding a replenishment target that balances service level (profit=holding) with holding cost given confirmed lead time and historical demand variability.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_15. Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders ordered on Period t arrived on Period t+4). Current inventory: on-hand=126, in-transit=328 (no new prolonged gaps since lead time confirmation). Demand samples available (137,92,110,43,128) with no sustained regime shift. I select L by 'calculate' to reflect confirmed observed lead time=4. I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each) and no evidence of a recent demand change. This keeps orders covering (L+1) periods of demand while avoiding extra stock given holding cost parity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=34, in-transit=334 (pipeline large). Demand history shows moderate, variable demand; use backed defaults to let OR engine compute base_stock given confirmed lead time. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples. This keeps safety stock aligned with historical variability while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding ad-hoc overordering given already-large pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), demand samples (137,92,110,43,128) yield moderate mean/variance. Current on-hand=18, in-transit=261 \u2014 pipeline is sizeable and consistent with L=4 arrivals continuing; no new sustained regime change detected. I select default L (use promised lead time = 4, which matches observed), default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to let OR backend compute the review+lead demand forecast, and default sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample volatility. This balances service (use full-sample demand estimate with confirmed L) vs holding cost given already-large pipeline and low on-hand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $39.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_18: recent conclude messages show consistent 4-period arrivals for orders that did conclude, and current on-hand=34, in-transit=341. Several earlier orders were delayed/lost but since Period_5 we have repeated lead_time=4 confirmations. Pipeline (341) plus on-hand (34) covers several periods of demand, so I will use inferred confirmed lead time and default demand moments to let the OR backend compute base stock. Chosen methods: L by 'calculate' to lock in observed lead_time=4 from concluded arrivals; mu_hat 'default' to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical demand samples (no sustained demand regime change detected); sigma_hat 'default' to use overall volatility. This balances service level (using confirmed lead time) against holding cost given current sizable pipeline and no new sustained demand shift.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=35, in-transit=371. Historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple confirmed arrivals with W=4). There are lingering in-transit units from earlier windows but recent history indicates lead time stable at 4. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding so q=0.5), use inferred lead time calculation and let backend compute demand over review+lead period from full sample history. Methods chosen: L=calculate to confirm average observed lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend uses all available demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively, providing conservative replenishment given existing large pipeline.

Demand shows no recent sustained regime shift; use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over samples. This keeps target base-stock aligned with observed lead time and overall demand while avoiding overreacting to earlier isolated missing shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period_21: on-hand=7, in-transit=369. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (orders placed in P1\u2013P16 arrived after 4 periods), so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. Demand historical samples (137,92,110,43,128) give mean \u2248102. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR backend will use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed LT=4 and limited on-hand stock. This choice accounts for the large pipeline (369) while relying on backend cap to avoid over-ordering if pipeline already covers the (1+L) demand forecast.

Period 22 (Period_22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_22: recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand samples (137,92,110,43,128) mean=102. With promised L=4, (1+L) coverage is 5 periods; default rules produce a forecast ~5\xd7mean to cover review+lead. Current on-hand=53 + in-transit=285 = 338 units, which is below the 5-period demand forecast, so keep forecasting based on full-sample mean and confirmed lead time to avoid stockouts. No clear sustained change in demand variance or mean detected that warrants a recent_N or EWMA override.

Pipeline + on-hand = 342 units available in future arrivals \u2014 no new lost-shipment signal. Using L="calculate" to let backend compute the observed average lead time (captures confirmed L=4). Demand history limited to provided samples; use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit=holding cost.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 for many arrivals; earlier missing shipments were observed but recent arrivals align with promised 4-period lead time. I therefore use the promised/default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with supplier terms. For demand forecast I select default methods so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical data and lets the OR engine produce the capped base-stock while accounting for current pipeline.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_27: on-hand=19, in-transit=320. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, etc.), so use observed lead time. Pipeline (320) plus on-hand covers several periods but some earlier shipments were delayed; using conservative demand forecast by letting backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility across all samples balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1). Chosen methods: L from observed data; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so OR backend applies full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L).

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28. Recent concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (multiple orders ordered on Pn arriving on Pn+4). On-hand=38, in-transit=314 \u2014 pipeline substantial relative to typical demand (~100/unit per period). I will set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period reality. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). This avoids overreacting to transient missing shipments earlier while keeping replenishment sized to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period_29: on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (many Pn orders arriving after 4 periods). Earlier missing shipments were recorded but recent history shows regular 4-period arrivals, so continue using promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (protecting against stockouts given long L) and holding cost without over-tuning to short-term noise.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30 decision. Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=401. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. Demand sample mean (Periods 1\u20135) = 102; using standard default calculations ensures mu_hat = (1+L)*mean to cover review+lead demand and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std to reflect observed volatility. Using default L (promised 4) is appropriate given repeated confirmations; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31: on-hand=0, in-transit=357. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (confirmed across many periods). No recent new evidence of changed demand regime. I therefore use the default lead time (promised 4) and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all demand history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This delegates demand aggregation to the backend and balances service vs. holding given profit=holding (q\u22480.5).

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=348. Historical demand samples (137,92,110,43,128) give mean=102. Promised lead time=4 and concluded arrivals across history consistently show lead_time=4, so use default lead time. No new sustained changepoint detected. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std so orders will aim to cover the current review+lead horizon while the capped policy limits order size given estimated variability.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_33: on-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders ordered at Pn arriving at Pn+4). Recent demand samples (provided) have mean=102 over the seed 5 samples. There is a sizable pipeline (366) but no fresh conclude indicating lost shipments. I will use default lead time (promised) because concluded history confirms L=4 and no sustained deviation. I will use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this uses the full-sample demand estimate to balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each), avoiding overreaction to transient fluctuations while accounting for the 5-period review+lead demand horizon.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: recent history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=444 \u2014 short of (1+L)\xd7mean demand (5\xd7102=510), so pipeline likely insufficient to cover next 5 periods. No new sustained demand or lead-time regime change detected; several earlier delayed/lost shipments were observed but lead time has been stable at 4. I choose default methods so the OR backend uses the promised lead time and full-sample statistics to compute base-stock and capped orders, letting it top up pipeline to cover the 5-period demand horizon while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 35 (Period_35) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_35: on-hand=38, in-transit=421. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded messages: e.g., P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Several earlier orders remained missing for multiple periods but recent concluded history shows stable 4-period arrivals. I set L by averaging observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. I use default demand and volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while the lead-time choice accounts for prior missing shipments by trusting concluded evidence. This balances service (use confirmed L) versus holding cost (default mu/sigma avoid overreacting to transient gaps).

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_36: historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals labeled lead_time=4 across history). Current inventory: on-hand=88, in-transit=328 (several past late shipments have since concluded). Promised L=4 is supported by observed concluded lead times, so set L via calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand sample set is limited; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to keep forecasts stable. This balances service level (using confirmed L=4) against holding cost given moderate on-hand + large pipeline.

There are earlier missing/delayed shipments recorded in carry-over but recent history shows steady 4-period service; default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) lets OR engine use full-sample demand stats to set base-stock while capping orders.

Earlier missing shipments were observed but recent history shows consistent 4-period arrivals, so use observed lead time. Set L using calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (confirmed =4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all available demand samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit=holding and stable demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $59.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40 decision. Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods across many concluded arrivals; current inventory on-hand=9, in-transit=407 (some earlier missing shipments resolved). Historical sample mean = 102 (from provided demand samples). Given confirmed LT=4 and stable demand samples, use default calculations so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters aligned with observed lead time and balances service vs holding cost.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=9, in-transit=410. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 4-period actual lead time (many orders placed in Period t arrive in Period t+4). Pipeline is large relative to on-hand; some earlier missing shipments were observed but lead time has been stable at 4. I choose to set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed reality. For demand I use the default aggregation so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service level (profit=holding so q=0.5) against holding cost without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical small-sample demand (chips Regular) provided: [137,92,110,43,128] and long history shows stable average demand with variability but no new sustained shift. Carry-over notes show prior missing/delayed shipments; current in-transit=300 may include delayed units but no new conclude confirming loss. I use default lead time (promised 4) because concluded messages historically confirm L=4 and there is no new evidence to change it. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost under the engine's model while letting the backend incorporate pipeline. I flagged overdue/delayed shipments in rationale; no new sustained regime change to record.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43: on-hand=9, in-transit=347. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (orders repeatedly arrived with lead_time=4) though some earlier shipments were delayed/lost\u2014pipeline is large but delayed confirmation exists. I choose L via calculate to let backend confirm average observed lead time (matches 4). Demand forecast and volatility use default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to keep the OR base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the backend's cap limits order size given the sizable pipeline. This balances service level vs holding cost given current low on-hand and large in-transit.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. Current on-hand=20, in-transit=424. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (many Period X conclude messages: orders placed arrived after 4 periods). Some past missing shipments were noted but most orders since Period_5 have concluded on a 4-period lag. Set L via "calculate" to let backend confirm average observed lead time (matches promised=4). Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full sample history\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding (=1) and no strong recent demand regime change.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45: on-hand=22, in-transit=398. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier (many 'ordered on Period X, arrived on Period X+4'), so actual lead time = 4 is well supported. To align OR backend with observed lead time while letting it compute demand stats from full history, I set L to calculate (average observed lead times). I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed L=4 and substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_46: on-hand=0, in-transit=399. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P conclude messages confirming 4). Several earlier missing shipments were observed but recent concludes show steady 4-period arrivals. Given profit=holding, use conservative default demand/uncertainty estimates and the promised lead time. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms 4; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples. This avoids over-reacting to past isolated missing shipments while allowing the OR engine to size orders to cover (L+1) periods of demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $127.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_47. Demand history shows stable ~100s-level weekly demand with confirmed actual lead time = 4 (many concluded arrivals at 4). Current inventory: on-hand 21 + in-transit 312. Several earlier shipments were delayed but recent history shows consistent 4-period arrivals. I therefore use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR engine uses full historical mean/variance over (1+L) periods; this keeps targets aligned with observed 4-period behavior and lets the capped policy limit order size given existing large pipeline.

On-hand=16, in-transit=333 \u2014 substantial pipeline but prior missing/delayed shipments noted earlier; no new sustained changepoint detected. I choose L='calculate' to lock actual observed lead time (average of concluded lead times \u22484). For demand forecast and volatility I choose defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, letting the OR engine use full-sample estimates; this balances service level (uses confirmed L) against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: on-hand=0, in-transit=435. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed earlier repeatedly arrived after 4 periods), and no new sustained demand regime or seasonality is evident. There are outstanding in-transit units but recent conclude history shows normal 4-period arrivals rather than a longer persistent delay. To let the OR engine use its long-run statistics and promised lead time, I select default methods so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from all samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (profit=holding, symmetric) using the backend's base-stock calculation while avoiding overreaction to transient in-transit fluctuations.

Several earlier missing shipments were resolved (arrivals matched Period+4), and current pipeline (428) likely covers upcoming (1+L) demand. I therefore use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all supplied samples; this keeps policy aligned with observed stable 4-period lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise and addressing potential overdue shipments via the pipeline term.
