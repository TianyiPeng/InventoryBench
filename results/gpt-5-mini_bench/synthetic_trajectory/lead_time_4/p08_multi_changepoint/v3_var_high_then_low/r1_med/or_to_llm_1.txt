Orders placed in Periods 1 and 3 (484+154=638) are still in-transit and expected to arrive no earlier than Period 5 arrival resolution (visible in Period 6 conclude). No concluded arrivals yet, so treat in-transit=638 as future supply. Step 2 - Demand estimate: Use provided historical samples (71,120,95,116,82): single-period mean \u03bc\u0304=96.8, \u03c3\u0304\u224821.18. For review+lead (L+1=5): \u03bc\u0302=484, \u03c3\u0302\u224847.36.

Step 4 - Observed recent demand: Concluded demands (Periods 1\u20133) show 110, 145, 113 (recent avg \u2248122.7, ~27% above historical mean). However these are exactly three periods of higher realized demand (but sales were zero due to zero on-hand), and arrival of large pipeline will materially increase available supply soon. Step 5 - Decision: Do not order this period (order=0). Rationale: current in-transit (638) > base_stock (\u2248524) and will cover expected review+lead demand; ordering now would increase holding cost before seeing actual arrivals and confirmed LT. Monitor upcoming conclude messages for actual arrival timing and whether the recent higher-demand pattern persists; if demand uplift is confirmed after arrivals, increase future orders accordingly.",
