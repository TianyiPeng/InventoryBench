{

Timing implication: an order placed in Period 48 would arrive in Period 52 (after the 50-period horizon), so it cannot affect sales before the game ends. Inventory & demand: on-hand=69 and in-transit=245 => pipeline visible = 314 units. With only Periods 48\u201350 remaining (3 periods), any new order will not arrive in time. OR's numeric recommendation (162) assumes replenishment will arrive within the horizon; given the confirmed L=4 and remaining horizon, placing orders now is futile and only increases holding cost if arrivals were to be observed later. Final strategy: place 0 units this period, rely on on-hand + in-transit to meet remaining demand and avoid unnecessary holding costs or wasted orders.",
