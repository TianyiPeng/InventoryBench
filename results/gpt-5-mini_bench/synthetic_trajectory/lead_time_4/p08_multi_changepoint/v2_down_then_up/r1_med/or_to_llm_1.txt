Recent realized demand in Period 1 was 124 (sold=0 due to zero on-hand but demand observed=124), substantially above the historical mean (\u2248+32%). Implications: pipeline (122) is well below the (L+1)-period expected demand (~469) and a single order cannot cover the full pipeline requirement; we should increase ordering relative to OR to start replenishing pipeline given the high recent demand, but avoid overcommitting because we have only one high-demand observation (not yet a sustained regime shift) and holding cost=$1/unit/period. Decision rule applied: raise OR's recommendation moderately to respond to the Period 1 demand spike without assuming a permanent regime shift. Final action: order 150 units for chips(Regular). This increases pipeline to 272 units (122 existing + 150 ordered) which is still conservative relative to 5-period demand but reduces shortfall while limiting holding cost risk.

Timing: On-hand=0 and In-transit=235 will arrive during Period 38 after my decision and can satisfy Period 38 demand; I will not see that arrival until Period 39 conclude. Demand & regime: Historical regime shifts recorded (Periods 5\u20138 up, Periods 27\u201331 down). Recent realized demands are volatile (Periods 33\u201337: 27,63,42,104,82) \u2014 no new sustained regime shift (fewer than 3 periods of a consistent new level). Inventory policy: With L=4 we must plan for (L+1)=5 future periods. OR recommends 127 using promised L and full history. However, current pipeline (235) is already substantial and will reduce the need to order large quantities now. Risks: If future demand returns to the mid-high recent levels (~75\u2013100), 235 covers ~3\u20134 periods; if demand stays at the low regime (~54), 235 covers ~4+ periods. Given holding cost = $1 vs profit = $4 (critical fractile 0.8), some safety stock is justified but over-ordering creates holding penalties. Action decision: Place a moderate order smaller than OR to top up pipeline toward coverage for 5 periods while avoiding excess holding cost. Calculation: target additional coverage = max(0, estimated 5-period demand \u2212 pipeline). Using a conservative estimated single-period demand \u224860\u201365 (blending recent volatility and the drop regime), 5-period demand \u2248300\u2013325; pipeline=235 \u2192 shortfall \u224865\u201390. I choose the lower end to avoid excess holding cost and because pipeline may suffice if demand remains subdued.
