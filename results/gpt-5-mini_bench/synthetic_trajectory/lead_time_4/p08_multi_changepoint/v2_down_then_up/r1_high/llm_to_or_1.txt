Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_4\p08_multi_changepoint\v2_down_then_up\r1_high\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 95), ('Period_2', 113), ('Period_3', 106), ('Period_4', 84), ('Period_5', 71)]
  Mean: 93.8, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical samples (Periods 1-5) show mean demand = 93.8 units/period. With promised lead time 4 and no evidence of changed lead time or demand regime, use defaults so backend sets mu_hat = (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std, ensuring the order policy targets coverage for the (L+1) review+lead horizon while avoiding premature adjustments based on no arrivals.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=122, recent concluded info shows Period_1 order (122) did not arrive (arrived=0) but single missed arrival is insufficient to infer a lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid overreacting. Demand history (samples: 95,113,106,84,71) mean=93.8; with L=4 default, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using all-sample defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps the base-stock anchored to historical demand while the pipeline is monitored for further missed arrivals.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=253 (orders from P1=122, P2=131) and no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time=4; with only two consecutive periods of zero arrivals this is insufficient to confirm lead-time shift or lost shipments. Use default lead time so backend assumes promised L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat to base demand forecast on full sample history (Periods 1-5) given no confirmed regime change. This keeps orders aligned with historical mean while avoiding premature adjustments for potentially delayed but not-yet-lost shipments.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=382. No concluded arrivals in Periods 1-3 (orders placed but arrived=0), suggesting delayed shipments but not yet confirmed lost or shorter lead time. Insufficient sustained evidence (need \u22653 periods of confirmed arrivals) to override promised lead time. Using default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility across all samples. This keeps ordering conservative given a large in-transit pipeline while avoiding premature manual overrides of demand or lead-time estimates.

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=511. Promised lead time=4. Concluded history shows no arrivals yet for orders placed P1\u2013P4, but by timing rules these P1\u2013P4 orders would only conclude at Period_6 or later if lead time equals promised 4, so missing concludes are not yet evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change. Demand samples: [95,113,106,84,71], mean=93.8. To avoid premature adjustments given no concluded lead-time shifts and a full pipeline, use default methods: keep promised lead time, and let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps ordering aligned with historical demand while avoiding overreacting to unconfirmed delivery issues.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1938.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean \u224893.8 units; current on-hand=19, in-transit=418. Concluded history shows an order placed on Period 1 arrived on Period 5 (lead_time=4), confirming promised lead time. I choose to set L using observed data, and use default demand/volatility computations (which apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine computes base-stock and cap with the full sample history and confirmed lead time. This balances service (use all data with confirmed L=4) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2630.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (two observed arrivals with W=4). Demand history (Periods1-5 samples) has mean ~93.8; on-hand=11, in-transit=392 (large pipeline arriving per confirmed LT). No evidence of lost shipments beyond those already resolved. I choose L=calculate to lock in observed LT=4, mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (stable recent mean), and sigma_hat=default to let backend scale variability by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (use confirmed LT and full-sample mean) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2080.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (evidence: three concluded arrivals with W=4). Recent demand has risen: Period_5-7 demands = 103, 139, 111 (avg \u2248117.7), up from historical mean 93.8. On-hand+in-transit = 29+401=430 units which is below the (1+L)-period demand implied by the recent regime (~5\xd7117.7=588). Therefore: set L by calculate to reflect observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-mean, higher-volatility regime so the OR backend increases target stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1422.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals from P1-P4). On-hand=79, in-transit=421 \u2014 ample pipeline but long lead time requires planning for (1+L) periods. I choose L by calculation to reflect observed lead times. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock given confirmed L and avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2052.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: recent realized lead times are consistently 4 (confirmed in history). Demand samples (Periods 1-5) mean=93.8 units/period -> baseline demand over review+lead (1+L=5) = 469 units. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=461 units, so pipeline short by ~8 units vs. baseline cover (469). I use L=default to trust the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time, mu_hat=default to anchor forecast to full-sample mean scaled by (1+L), and sigma_hat=default to reflect historical variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings drive the OR backend to target the long-run service level implied by profit vs. holding cost while recognizing we are slightly short in pipeline and should order to top up pipeline coverage.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1175.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11. Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4. On-hand=41, in-transit=466 -> total pipeline+on-hand=507 units. Historical sample mean demand = 93.8 (Periods 1-5); (1+L)=5 -> expected demand over review+lead \u2248469. Pipeline slightly above expected demand, providing cushion against variability. Set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 4; use default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend computes base_stock and cap from full-sample statistics. No evidence of a new demand regime or lost shipments since arrivals have matched promised lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1221.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 and no sustained demand regime change (historical samples: 95,113,106,84,71; mean ~93). On-hand=109 + in-transit=384 provides healthy coverage vs (1+L)-period demand. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) and use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This is conservative given stable lead time evidence and avoids overfitting to short-sample noise while letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 start. Recent demand shows volatility with no clear sustained regime shift: last 5 demands (Periods 8-12) = [79,108,64,70,128], mean ~89.8. On-hand=130, in-transit=297 (pipeline healthy). Previously confirmed lead time = 4 periods (carry-over). Use promised lead time to match supplier expectation and because arrivals have consistently concluded at 4. To keep service while avoiding excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19, use recent_N demand estimates (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent regime and variability; keep L as default (promised). This balances service level (capture recent demand upticks) versus holding cost by not over-reacting to older data or single spikes.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=4 (multiple observations). On-hand=62, in-transit=351. Demand samples provided seed forecasting. I choose L by calculating average observed lead times to confirm actual LT (matches promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given high in-transit volume and confirmed LT.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 start. On-hand=66, in-transit=381. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders from P1..P10 arrived after 4 periods). No new demand regime detected. Use calculated L based on observed lead times to confirm 4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; given high profit ($19) vs holding ($1) this yields a relatively high target base-stock to prioritize service level while backend cap limits orders to control inventory.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: recent confirmed lead time = 4 periods (observed repeatedly in conclude messages). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean 93.8 units/period. Current inventory: on-hand=32, in-transit=462 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to one-period demand, so use conservative standard forecasting. I choose L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (backend will compute avg observed lead time =4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose 'default' so backend uses (1+L)*mean_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples respectively; this balances service level (high profit) against holding cost given a confirmed 4-period lead time and large pipeline, avoiding aggressive up-weighting from short-run noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $706.00

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: recent demand has been around ~100 units/period with some downward pull (last 5 demands: 128,137,106,90,40). On-hand=54, in-transit=485 -> pipeline + on-hand >> expected (L+1) periods demand, so no urgent emergency ordering. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period reality. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets base stock appropriate to current lower/volatile demand and avoids excess holding costs given low holding cost relative to profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1263.00

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18. Recent realized demands show a downward shift over the last 3 periods (P15-17: 90, 40, 72) vs earlier periods. On-hand=105, in-transit=466 => pipeline_inventory=571 which already covers (1+L)=5 periods at typical demand levels, so we should shrink forecast to recent pace to avoid excess holding cost. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 (carry-over). I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time, mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent lower-demand regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock and caps ordering to limit holding costs while maintaining service given large in-transit stock.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_19: on-hand=172, in-transit=326. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P14 arrived after 4 periods) so set L via calculation of observed lead times. No sustained demand regime shift detected; use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the backend's base-stock anchored to overall historical demand while the calculated L ensures pipeline coverage for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 20: confirmed historical lead time = 4 (carry-over). Recent inventory: on-hand=241, in-transit=255 (ample pipeline). Historical demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean ~93.8 units/period. I will use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for volatility; this keeps parameters consistent with confirmed LT=4 and leverages all available demand history while avoiding overreacting to short-term inventory fluctuations. This respects the checklist: on-hand + pipeline cover several periods of demand, so no aggressive uplifts are needed; defaults balance service level vs holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

On-hand=260, in-transit=232 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand ample versus typical demand. No overdue/lost shipments visible. Set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4 from concluded arrivals; use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Demand context: available sample set (Period_1\u20135) and longer observed demand history used by backend defaults.

Period 27. Recent demand samples (historical seed) have mean \u224894 units/period; (1+L)=5 implies 470 units forecast over review+lead. On-hand=249 + in-transit=254 = 503 units, which modestly exceeds the 5-period demand forecast (503 \u2248 5.36 periods of cover). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior history; no evidence of additional delays or lost shipments in concluded messages. Using default methods keeps the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand stats, balancing service level (maintain ~5-period cover) versus holding cost.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28. Current on-hand=292, in-transit=175; demand history shows stable fulfillment with concluded arrivals consistently indicating 4-period lead times. Use observed lead-time inference to align promised vs. actual. Choose L='calculate' to lock in confirmed 4-period lead time from concluded arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, preserving historical demand signal and letting the optimizer balance profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1). This keeps orders sized to cover (L+1) periods of demand while letting the capped policy limit order size.

Period 29. On-hand=268, in-transit=211. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand samples (95,113,106,84,71) show no sustained regime shift. I use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples).

Period 30. Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple P arrivals with W=4). On-hand=286, in-transit=188 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy but demand samples (provided) are limited. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so backend uses (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1). No evidence of a new demand regime or lost shipments requiring explicit adjustments.

I will use the promised/default lead time to match confirmed observations. Demand history (samples provided) shows mean ~93.8; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) keeps parameters consistent with observed steady demand and the confirmed 4-period lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given high profit relative to holding cost.

Use promised lead time and all-sample demand moments so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-history mean/variance; this keeps parameters stable given ample on-hand + pipeline and avoids overreacting to short-term variation.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_33 decision. Observed on-hand=261, in-transit=187. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained evidence from P5\u2013P32 arrivals). Demand samples (Period_1\u20135) mean=93.8 used as baseline. To align OR backend with confirmed lead time and stable historical demand, I use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand forecasting: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps the base-stock tied to long-run sample stats while the OR engine caps orders to the computed cap, balancing service level (high profit) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34. Recent visible demand samples (provided seed) have mean 93.8 over 5 periods; current on-hand=280, in-transit=203 (total pipeline 483). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (observed arrivals consistently at 4). To balance high unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), I keep the backend's default lead time and use default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base-stock from the full-sample mean and volatility. This relies on (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to produce a conservative order that leverages substantial on-hand + in-transit inventory while maintaining service level given confirmed L=4 and no new sustained demand regime change.

On-hand=264, in-transit=179 \u2192 total pipeline+on-hand=443 units vs (1+L)*mean demand ~469, a small shortfall (~26 units). Historical conclude messages consistently show 4-period actual lead time; no missing shipments recently. I choose default methods to let the OR engine compute base stock from full-sample stats with promised lead time, which balances service level and low holding cost given current ample inventory.

To keep alignment with supplier promise and observed arrivals, use default lead time and default demand/volatility computations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39. On-hand=64, in-transit=286 (pipeline total=350) which comfortably covers ~5 periods of typical demand given historical averages. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. I use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the large pipeline already mitigates short-term stockout risk and avoids excess holding cost from aggressive explicit orders.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_40. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean ~94; history of concluded arrivals confirms actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=32, in-transit=358 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to on-hand. Profit/holding ratio (19/(19+1)) implies high service-level target. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and let the OR engine compute base_stock and cap from full-sample statistics so it accounts for long-run mean and variance while the large pipeline prevents aggressive additional ordering now.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41. On-hand=0, in-transit=446 \u2014 substantial pipeline but no visible arrivals yet (last conclude shows arrival from P36 only). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods; use lead-time estimate from observations. Choose L=calculate to lock in observed avg lead time (4). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples (conservative pooling given pipeline size). This balances service (high profit vs stockouts) against holding costs by letting the OR engine set base-stock using full-sample demand stats while respecting confirmed lead time and current large in-transit inventory.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: on-hand=0, in-transit=415. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; shipments have been arriving with 4-period lag. Recent demand (Periods 37-41) has been elevated and more variable (82,151,92,123,180) so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the current regime. Set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 5 demand samples, which balances higher recent demand against holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=527. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving with 4-period actual lead time (confirmed earlier). Demand sample seed (periods 1-5) mean=93.8. Given confirmed LT=4 and stable historical demand samples, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes base-stock using (1+L)\xd7mean and scaled volatility. This keeps pipeline coverage for (L+1)=5 periods to protect service while avoiding unnecessary explicit increases that would raise holding cost. Current parameters rely on defaults to let the backend account for promised LT and sample statistics; the large in-transit quantity will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing net order.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44 decision. On-hand=0, in-transit=410. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P conclude messages), so I accept promised lead time and use default L. Demand history (many concluded periods) shows no sustained regime shift since prior carry-over; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using full-sample demand mean over the lead+review horizon) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and avoids overreacting to short fluctuations or isolated delays.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: on-hand=51, in-transit=427, recent history shows consistent observed lead_time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals at 4). Demand has no recent sustained regime shift. Pipeline + on-hand is large relative to single-period demand, so use baseline stats to let OR backend compute balanced base-stock. Select default lead time and default demand moments so backend uses full sample mean/variance over (1+L) review+lead period.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. On-hand=14, in-transit=427; historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time =4 (multiple confirmations). Pipeline is large relative to on-hand so continue using promised lead time. Set L to default (use promised 4). Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (high pipeline) against holding cost given current large in-transit stock and confirmed LT=4.

Inventory pipeline is large so use conservative default estimates tied to promised lead time to let OR backend compute base-stock from full historical demand. Choose default for L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to rely on (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service vs. holding given high pipeline and confirmed lead time.

Use promised/default lead time to keep model aligned with observed confirmations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring orders cover the (L+1) review+lead demand while the high profit/holding ratio (q\u22480.95) drives a high service-level via the OR formula.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 49. Recent demand has been variable but shows no sustained regime shift; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (carry-over). On-hand=23, in-transit=420 => healthy pipeline but arrivals will be visible with one-period delay. I choose L=default to use promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level given high profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) and avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations or occasional delayed arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period_50: Recent history shows stable lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier) and no sustained demand regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=467 (sufficient pipeline for upcoming periods given historical demand). Use promised/default lead time and demand estimates (no recent changepoint detected) so the OR backend applies its usual (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations. This balances service level (maintain coverage over L+1 periods) against holding cost given current ample in-transit stock.
