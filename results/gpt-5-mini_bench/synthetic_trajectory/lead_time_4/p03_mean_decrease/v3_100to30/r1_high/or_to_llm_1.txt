Demand outlook: Recent single-period demand has been ~30\u201335 units (Periods 20\u201349 average \u224832), consistent with prior carry-over insight of a sustained drop to ~33.6.

Decision: place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and wait one period to observe actual arrivals in the conclude message (will reveal whether pipeline fully arrives as expected or if any shipments are lost/delayed). This keeps ending_inventory lower while still relying on in-transit supply; if arrivals underperform next period, place a corrective order sized to cover the realized shortfall plus safety.
