{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: No concluded arrivals beyond Period 1 conclude (Period 1 order of 122 shows arrived=0). This is consistent with promised lead time L=4 (we would not expect the Period 1 order to conclude until Period 5 conclude), so no evidence to change the assumed lead time or to declare the shipment lost.\nInventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=122. Historical sample mean \u03bc\u0304 = (109+68+99+80+105)/5 = 92.2 units/period, \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 17.5.

Pipeline (122) is well below that, so an uncapped order would be \u2248339. However OR applies a cap to smooth orders: cap \u2248 \u03bc\u0304 + \u03a6\u22121(0.95)\xd7\u03c3\u0304 \u2248 92.2 + 1.645\xd717.5 \u2248 121. OR's final capped recommendation (118) is close to that cap and reflects risk control given demand variability and capped policy.\nDecision / strategy: I accept the OR recommendation of 118 units. Rationale: no evidence of lead-time change or lost shipments, one observed demand (75) is a single low sample and not a sustained regime shift, and the OR cap prevents over-ordering despite pipeline shortfall versus the 5-period expected demand. Ordering 118 respects the baseline cap while increasing pipeline toward the OR's safety-aware target.\nAdjustment summary: Follow OR's capped quantity (118) because current evidence does not justify deviating upward to cover the full 5-period expected demand (would be 339) and deviating downward risks stockouts without confirmed lower-demand regime.",
