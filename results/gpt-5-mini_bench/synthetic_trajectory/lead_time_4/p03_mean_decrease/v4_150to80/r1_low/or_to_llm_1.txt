{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (from carry-over). Inventory analysis: on-hand=54, in-transit=292 -> pipeline_total=346. Demand outlook: recent 5-period demand (P45\u2013P49 = 79,77,97,79,124) average \u224891 per period; (L+1)=5 period demand forecast \u2248455. OR recommended 174 (uses long-run history and promised L); OR likely higher than needed given large pipeline. Order calculation: target_cover = 5-period demand \u2248455; order_raw = target_cover \u2212 pipeline_total = 455 \u2212 346 = 109. Rounding to integer and non-negative gives 109. Strategy: place order=109 to bring expected available inventory to cover the next 5 periods' demand while avoiding excess holding cost.
