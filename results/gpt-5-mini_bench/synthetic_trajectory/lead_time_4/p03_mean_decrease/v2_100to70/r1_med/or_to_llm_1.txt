Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=40, in-transit=380 (likely the Period_2 order of 380 still in transit and expected to arrive during Period_6 arrival resolution but will be visible in conclude of Period_6+1). Demand estimate (using Periods 1\u20135 realized demands 59,75,131,57,109): mean single-period \u03bc\u0304=86.2, \u03c3\u0304\u224832.6.

Strategy: actual lead time confirmed = promised, and large in-transit volume (380) will cover most upcoming demand; holding cost is significant relative to profit, so avoid over-ordering. I therefore place a modest order slightly below the uncapped order_raw to be conservative about holding cost and potential lost shipments: order 72 units. This keeps pipeline+on-hand near the computed base-stock target without creating excessive holding. Short-term: this sustains service while minimizing holding cost risk.

Given high profit ($4) relative to holding ($1) (q=0.8), and confirmed lead time = 4, it's optimal to top up to the computed base-stock to reduce stockout risk over the lead+review horizon while staying within cap constraints (118 < computed cap \u2248148).

Using historical early-sample means (Period 1\u20135 average \u224893 units/period) implies (L+1)=5 period coverage \u2248465 units; using the broader observed sequence most recent periods show lower typical demand (~70\u201390). Even if true mean is ~82 units/period, 5-period demand \u2248410 units which is essentially covered by current pipeline+on-hand (411). Ordering more now would raise holding cost ($1/unit/period) and reduce profit per unit tradeoff (profit $4, holding $1), while the pipeline appears healthy and there is no evidence of lost shipments.
