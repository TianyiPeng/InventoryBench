Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods, so to avoid stockouts you should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because arrivals occur after decision and current-period demand happens post-decision. With no on-hand and no in-transit inventory, target coverage = 5 * 93 = 465 units. Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so excess inventory is costly, but given long promised lead time and zero pipeline, ordering to cover the 5-period demand minimizes expected lost sales risk.
