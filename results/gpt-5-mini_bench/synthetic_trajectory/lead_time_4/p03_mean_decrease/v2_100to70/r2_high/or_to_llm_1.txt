My calculation of a conservative base-stock (incorporating high critical fractile q=0.95) would push a larger order (~205) to fully restore safety stock, but that increases holding cost substantially. 4) Decision: follow OR recommendation of 147 units. Rationale: pipeline (383) is below OR's capped replenishment target and below a full high-service base-stock, and OR's cap smooths volatility; given limited evidence of a sustained regime shift and high holding cost over time, 147 balances service and holding risk. 5) Implementation note: this order plus in-transit will better cover the next (L+1)=5 periods while avoiding excessive holding costs if the recent demand spike is transient.",

Inventory position: on-hand 110 + in-transit 416 = 526 units in pipeline. Comparison: pipeline 526 > expected 5-period demand 465 by ~61 units.

Given high profit vs low holding cost, ordering is useful if we need coverage, but current pipeline already exceeds expected remaining demand and excess would incur holding cost for remaining periods. Also lead time is 4, so any order placed now arrives in Period 50 and would only affect the final period, providing little benefit versus holding cost.
