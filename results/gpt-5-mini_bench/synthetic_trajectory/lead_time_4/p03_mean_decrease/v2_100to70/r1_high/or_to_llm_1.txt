Analysis: for a high profit-to-hold ratio (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.95, z\u22481.645) the uncapped base stock would be \u03bc\u0302 + z\xb7\u03c3\u0302 = 465 + 1.645\xb774.9 \u2248 588 units, but OR cap reduces that to ~148.

More recent realized demand over Periods 1\u20137 averages ~86.3 units/period (total 604 over 7 periods). Using a conservative recent estimate (86\u201393) gives 5-period demand between ~431 and 465 units.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare supply vs. demand: Pipeline_total=438 lies between the two 5-period demand estimates and is very close to or slightly above the recent-demand-based requirement (~431). The OR capped policy recommended 130 units (OR uses promised lead time and older stats); its internal calculation would order to bring pipeline closer to a higher base-stock (~588) and cap ~148. However, given the large existing pipeline and recent demand trending slightly lower than the older training mean, placing a large order now risks unnecessary holding cost.\n\nStep 4 \u2014 Risk tradeoff: Profit per unit ($19) >> holding cost ($1), so stockouts are more costly relative to holding; yet current pipeline appears sufficient to cover the next 5 periods with a modest safety margin under recent demand. There is no evidence of a sustained upward demand shift (need 3+ periods of elevated demand) nor any lost shipments beyond the confirmed lead time.\n\nFinal decision: Defer replenishment this period and order 0 units.
