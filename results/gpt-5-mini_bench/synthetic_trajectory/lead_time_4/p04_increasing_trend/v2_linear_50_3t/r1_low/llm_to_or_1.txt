  Samples: [('Period_1', 30), ('Period_2', 49), ('Period_3', 48), ('Period_4', 65), ('Period_5', 56)]

Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical samples for chips(Regular) available (30,49,48,65,56) but no concluded arrivals observed yet; promised lead time 4 periods will be used. To let the OR backend compute replenishment using full-sample demand estimates and the promised lead time, set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default so base-stock and cap are computed from all samples. This addresses missing pipeline by relying on conservative default forecast and the backend's safety stock formula.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=71 (order placed P1). No concluded arrivals yet; the P1 order arriving=0 is expected given promised lead time=4. No evidence of lead-time change or demand regime shift (insufficient sustained signal). Pipeline (71) plus on-hand covers several periods of expected demand under baseline stats. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend uses full sample mean/variance over (1+L) periods, balancing service level vs holding cost conservatively while we wait for arrival confirmations.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start. Observed demand samples (P1-P5) show moderate variability; on-hand=0, in-transit=140, but no concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (arrived=0). Promised lead time is 4; we have insufficient concluded evidence to change lead-time estimate or demand regime (need \u22653 periods of consistent signal). To avoid overreacting to potentially delayed or lost shipments, use the backend defaults: L=default (promised lead time) and demand estimates based on all samples (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default). This balances service level using full-sample stats while letting the OR engine account for promised L and pipeline.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4 decision: on-hand=0, in-transit=207 (equals sum of P1-P3 orders), no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed P1-P3 remain in-transit). No confirmed change in actual lead time (no 'arrived' conclude messages), so use promised lead time and default demand stats. Choose L=default to rely on promised 4-period lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples, providing a neutral forecast while awaiting arrival confirmations. This conservatively balances service level vs holding cost given uncertainty and outstanding pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: Period_5. Demand context: historical samples for chips(Regular) = [30,49,48,65,56] (mean=49.6, std\u224811.53). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=269 (sum of orders placed P1- P4). Concluded history shows no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (ordered=71,69,67,62 \u2192 269 total). Promised lead time=4; however shipments from four consecutive periods have not concluded. Despite overdue pipeline, we MUST only use concluded arrivals to confirm actual lead time, so we keep L as default (promised). Using default methods: mu_hat default \u2192 (1+L)\xd7mean_all_samples = 5\xd749.6 (backend computes); sigma_hat default \u2192 sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all_samples (backend computes). This keeps the OR engine targeting the historical demand central tendency while the large in-transit quantity will cap ordering; it also avoids overreacting to potentially lost shipments until arrival evidence appears.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed Period1-4 (71+69+67+62 = 269 units) have not arrived by Period_5 conclude \u2014 suggests either lost shipments or actual lead time > promised 4; sustained absence over 4 periods.

Daily Profit: $57.00, Daily Holding Cost: $14.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $43.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: Recent concludes confirm an actual lead time of 4 (P1 order arrived in Period_5). On-hand=14, in-transit=198 \u2014 pipeline looks large but some orders placed P2\u2013P4 have not yet concluded. To reflect current demand regime and recent observations, set L by observed lead times and forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods so the OR engine targets service while limiting extra holding given holding_cost=profit. Methods: L=calculate (uses observed lead times); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture latest mean demand over the review+lead period; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period_1 order arrived in Period_5, lead_time=4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $17.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7: on-hand=33, in-transit=200. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period_1\u2192arrived Period_5, Period_2\u2192arrived Period_6). Use L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time average=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), keeping forecast based on full historical sample set and letting the OR engine set base-stock and caps. This balances service (confirmed L=4) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8 decision. Recent demand has been elevated and variable: last 5 demands = [86,45,57,50,50], mean=57.6. On-hand=50 + in-transit=165 => pipeline=215, which covers ~4+ periods of expected demand but may be tight vs. 5-period coverage. Observed lead times from concluded messages = 4 periods (consistent for three arrivals); therefore set L based on observed data. Use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current regime (uses last 5 periods). These settings give the OR backend a 5-period forecast (1+L) built from the most recent regime to balance service level against holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9. Historical demand mean = 49.6 units/period (samples P1-5). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods (orders from P1-P4 arrived with W=4). On-hand=48, in-transit=176 \u2192 pipeline=224 units vs. (1+L)*mean \u2248 5*49.6 = 248 required \u2192 ~24 unit shortfall. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm L=4) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the forecast anchored to confirmed historical demand while letting the OR engine size safety stock given promised lead time and variance. This choice addresses the small pipeline shortfall without overstocking given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: recent demand (Periods 5-9 = 57,50,50,64,31) averages ~50.4. Concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). On-hand=17 and in-transit=220; pipeline appears large but lead time confirmed so pipeline must be counted. Use L='calculate' to lock in observed LT=4. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean to reflect current demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility for safety stock. These settings balance service (use recent demand & confirmed LT) vs holding costs by avoiding overreacting to older samples or lost-shipment noise.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: recent observed arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=60, in-transit=164 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy vs. recent demand. Historical sample mean = 49.6 (periods provided), so using default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean) keeps the OR engine aligned with long-run demand; default volatility is used to let backend compute safety stock from full-sample std. L set to calculated/confirmed lead time to reflect observed reality and ensure orders cover the full review+lead horizon. These choices balance service (matching observed 4-period LT and full-sample demand mean) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12. Recent realized lead times consistently 4 periods (observed P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P6->P10, P7->P11). Demand last 5 concluded periods (P7\u2013P11) = [50,64,31,28,64], average ~47.4. On-hand=28, in-transit=160 \u2014 pipeline is sizable but arrivals are delayed by confirmed L=4. Use L inferred from observations to align ordering timing with actual arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and variability on the latest regime and avoid diluting with earlier samples.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=38 + in-transit=136 => pipeline=174 units, which is below (1+L)*mean demand of 5*50=250, so we need replenishment. Concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead_time=4; use calculated L to match evidence. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and keep orders responsive to recent lower volatility.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14: on-hand=0, in-transit=168. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (orders from P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demands across Periods 1-5: [30,49,48,65,56] and later realized demands up to P13 show variability but no sustained regime shift; therefore use default demand and volatility aggregation so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This choice keeps pipeline target proportional to long-run mean while the backend cap limits order size to protect against lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=239; recent demand samples (30,49,48,65,56) mean=49.6. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 4), and use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (5\xd749.6=248) and sigma_hat computed by backend as sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps the OR backend aligned with confirmed lead time while letting it size base-stock to balance $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period_16: recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders with lead_time=4). On-hand=0, in-transit=254 \u2014 pipeline is large and covers several future periods. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed average lead time (matches the many observed 4-period leads). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, providing a stable forecast given limited sample history and avoiding overfitting to short-term variability. This balances service (profit=holding cost) while avoiding unnecessary extra inventory given substantial in-transit stock.

On-hand=0, in-transit=240 units \u2014 pipeline is large but slightly below the (1+L)\xd7historical mean demand (~248 units using sample mean 49.6 and L=4), so we should keep the backend using the empiric lead-time estimate and standard default demand stats. I select L by calculate to lock to observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given current pipeline and confirmed L=4. No evidence of a new sustained demand regime or lead-time change beyond the confirmed L=4.

On-hand=0, in-transit=218 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy but on-hand is zero so we must rely on pipeline. Use L="calculate" to let backend confirm average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (evidence supports 4). Use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. This keeps parameters aligned with observed lead time and historical demand without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 20 (Period_20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_20: on-hand=0, in-transit=269. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (orders from P1->P5 etc. arrived with 4-period lag). Recent demand has shifted up sharply since Period_13 (sustained high demands). Set L by calculate to reflect observed lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the latest sustained high-demand regime (Periods 13\u201319), so the OR engine raises base-stock to cover higher demand while recognizing increased volatility. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1 vs $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period_13: avg demand increased from ~52 (Periods 1\u201312) to ~95 (Periods 13\u201319), +83% (sustained over 7 periods).

Period 21 (Period_21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_21 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=350. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period_13 (Periods 13\u201320 average demand ~95 vs ~52 earlier). I choose L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) covering the new high-demand regime (Periods 13\u201320) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent high-demand samples. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=8) to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices ensure the OR backend plans for the confirmed longer lead time and the higher, sustained demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability; using recent data also mitigates risk from older low-demand periods and from previously delayed/lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22. On-hand=0, in-transit=417. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed), and demand shifted up at Period 13 (sustained). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (4). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 13\u201321) to capture the higher regime mean; same N for sigma to capture recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23. Demand has been on a higher regime since Period 13 (~95 avg). On-hand=0, in-transit=412 units (covers upcoming demand). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 13\u201322) so mu_hat reflects the new mean across the review+lead horizon. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=10 to capture recent volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock target to the confirmed higher demand while avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples and account for the in-transit stock when ordering.

Period 24 (Period_24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_24 start. Demand regime confirmed higher since Period_13 (avg ~95 over Periods13-23 vs ~52 earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=416. Promised lead time=4 and concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4, so use observed lead time. Pipeline (416) is slightly below (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand (5\xd7~95\u2248475), so we must target the recent high-demand regime to avoid stockouts. Set L by calculating average observed lead times (will confirm as 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (Periods13-23, regime_length=11) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility reflecting the new higher demand and limits excessive holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 25 (Period_25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=401. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5 etc.) and demand regime increased at P13 (sustained higher demand thereafter). Pipeline (401) must cover 1+L future periods; using inferred lead time from concluded history avoids underordering if promised differed. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Demand forecast uses recent regime (Periods 13\u201324) \u2014 N=12 \u2014 to capture the higher mean; volatility likewise uses the same recent window. These choices bias orders toward the new higher-demand regime while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid stockouts, balancing profit vs holding cost given equal unit profit and holding.

Period 26 (Period_26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 26: on-hand=6, in-transit=425. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed in P1\u2013P21 arrived after 4 periods). Demand regime shifted up at Period 13 (Periods 1\u201312 mean ~52; Periods 13\u201325 mean ~95). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift from Period 13 onward (higher mean \u224895); on-hand=0 with in-transit=462 which covers multiple future periods. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in conclude messages). To reflect the new higher-demand regime I set demand estimates using recent data from the post-changepoint regime (Periods 13\u201326, length=14). L uses calculated observed lead times. Mu and sigma use recent_N with N=14 to capture the new mean and volatility and ensure the OR base-stock targets the higher service level while accounting for current pipeline; this helps avoid stockouts given elevated demand and confirmed 4-period lead time while limiting excess holding.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: on-hand=0, in-transit=469. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5 etc.), and no recent prolonged losses. Demand regime shift detected at Period_13: average demand increased from ~52 (P1\u2013P12) to ~95 (P13\u2013P27), sustained for 15 periods. To reflect the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base stock and caps using the post-changepoint mean/volatility over the 15 most recent concluded periods. L set to default (promised lead time = 4) because concluded history confirms lead time=4. These choices keep service during the higher-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline limits immediate extra ordering risk.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29. Demand regime since Period 13 is higher and sustained (avg ~95 from P13\u2013P28 per carry-over). On-hand=1, in-transit=475 (large pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To align the OR engine with the confirmed regime shift, I set L via observed lead times and set demand estimates using recent data from the high-demand regime (most recent 16 periods, P13\u2013P28). This focuses forecast and volatility on the current higher-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity will be reconciled by the OR cap. Choices aim to keep service high during the elevated-demand regime while avoiding excess additional ordering given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 13 (periods 13\u201329 average much higher than 1\u201312). On-hand=0, in-transit=425 (covers multiple future periods given L\u22484). Actual lead time has been consistently 4 in concluded messages, so use the observed lead-time handling. Set L via calculation/default equivalent to 4. For demand forecast use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean and variability: use N=17 (Periods 13\u201329) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last17) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last17). This balances service level for the new higher-demand regime while avoiding excessive extra safety stock because substantial pipeline already exists.

Period 31 (Period_31) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_31: on-hand=0, in-transit=463. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=4 (many orders: e.g., P1->P5, P2->P6, ...), so use calculated lead time. Demand regime shifted at Period_13 (sustained higher demand through Period_30); use recent_N to capture the post-change demand mean/volatility. Chosen methods: L=calculate to lock in observed 4-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=18 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the 18-period high-demand regime (Periods 13\u201330); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=18 to reflect recent volatility. These settings ensure the OR engine targets a base-stock sized for the sustained higher demand and the confirmed lead time while avoiding reliance on stale low-demand data.

Period 32 (Period_32) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_32: on-hand=0, in-transit=482. Historical concludes show stable actual lead time=4 (orders consistently arrived after 4 periods) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period_13 (higher mean). I set L to 'calculate' to confirm actual lead time from observed concludes. For demand I use recent_N over the post-change regime to capture the higher mean/volatility (N=19 covers Period_13\u2013Period_31). These parameters direct the OR backend to size base stock and caps for the higher-demand regime while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 33 (Period_33) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed repeatedly), on-hand=0, in-transit=490. Demand regime shifted up at Period 13 and has persisted through Period 32 (regime length = 20 periods, higher mean ~95). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to promised lead time (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the last 20 periods (the confirmed high-demand regime). This raises target base-stock to cover the (1+L) high-demand window while sigma from recent data controls safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. On-hand=0, in-transit=504. Historical conclues show consistent actual lead_time=4 (orders from P1 onward have been arriving with W=4). Demand regime shifted up at Period 13 and has persisted; recent demand is much higher than early periods. To reflect the sustained higher demand and protect service while avoiding excess holding, set L=default (use promised 4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint regime (use last 20 demand samples). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 to capture current volatility. This ensures base_stock and cap are computed from the elevated recent mean/volatility rather than diluted by pre-shift low demands. No evidence of additional lost shipments since lead_time=4 is confirmed.

Demand regime shifted at Period 13 to a higher level (sustained). I set L by calculation to reflect observed lead times. For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-Period-13 high-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the base-stock and cap responsive to the sustained higher demand while recognizing confirmed 4-period lead time; current pipeline + on-hand will be evaluated by the OR engine against the updated mu/sigma.

Period 36 (Period_36) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36: recent demand regime (Periods 13\u201335) is elevated (~95 vs ~52 earlier). On-hand=29, in-transit=441 \u2014 pipeline is large and consistent with confirmed 4-period lead time. Use promised/default lead time to match supplier promise and past confirms. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (choose last 20 samples from Periods 16\u201335) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean across (1+L) review+lead horizon. Use recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This balances service (higher base stock to meet higher demand) against holding cost given already-large pipeline.

No evidence of new lost shipments. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (to confirm actual L=4 to the backend). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which captures the sustained higher-demand regime and keeps parameters grounded in full-history statistics given holding cost = profit.

Actual lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N on demand stats (capture most recent regime data, capped at 20 samples). L uses promised/default (matches observed). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to anchor the base-stock and volatility to the higher-demand regime so OR orders enough to meet elevated demand while limiting excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Current Period 39. On-hand 0, in-transit 443. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded messages P5..P38 confirm 4). Demand increased and remained at a higher regime starting around Period 13 (sustained). To respect observed lead time and recent higher-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent ~20-period demand behavior so the OR engine sizes base stock for the new regime. In-transit 443 + on-hand 0 provides coverage for several periods; using recent data reduces stockouts under the higher demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period_40: demand has been in a higher regime since Period_13 (sustained ~+83%). On-hand=0, in-transit=502 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the post-Period_13 regime while capping N per rules). Use recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (capture higher mean demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Observed concluded lead times consistently =4 (confirmed historically). I set L using recent observations (calculate) to reflect confirmed lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (use the last 20 demand samples from the higher-demand regime) so the OR backend sizes base-stock and cap to the current higher mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given large pipeline and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42: demand has been in a higher regime since Period_13 (sustained ~+83%). On-hand=0, in-transit=698 \u2014 substantial pipeline likely covering several periods but recent conclude (Period_41) showed arrived=0 indicating an overdue arrival for an order placed earlier; however historical concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (matches observed lead_time=4 across many concludes). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (N capped at 20 per rules). This focuses the base-stock target on the new, higher demand level while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=0, in-transit=547. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed arrive after 4 periods), and demand has been in a higher regime since Period_13 (carry-over note). Several recent periods showed large demands (periods 24\u201342) and one recent zero arrival (Period_41 ordered=169 arrived=0) but overall concluded arrivals consistently imply L=4. I choose L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use 'default' so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full demand history, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost. With on-hand=0 and large in-transit, these parameters let the backend target a base-stock that covers (L+1) periods of demand while capping order size to limit overstock risk in case of delayed/lost shipments.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44. On-hand=0, in-transit=374. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods (use calculate to confirm L=4). Demand regime shifted up around Period_13 (sustained higher mean since P13); use recent_N (N=20) to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent regime to reflect current higher mean and volatility. In-transit 374 provides coverage vs. (1+L) periods\u2014parameters based on recent demand help the OR backend set base stock to balance $1 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for observed lead time and avoiding excess orders if some in-transit units arrive as expected.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: demand has been in the higher regime confirmed since Period 13 (sustained). On-hand=5, in-transit=390 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use a recent-window estimate for demand (captures last ~20 periods of the high regime) while using the observed lead time average. This keeps base-stock sized to meet (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while sigma from the same recent window captures current volatility; using recent_N reduces overweighting of the low-demand early periods and the large pipeline is accounted for by the OR engine's pipeline subtraction.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. Demand has been in the higher regime confirmed at Period 13 (sustained); observed lead time repeatedly equals promised 4 periods. Current on-hand=8, in-transit=422 \u2014 large pipeline covering many future periods, so use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses full historical stats. Using defaults (promised L and default mu/sigma) avoids overreacting to pipeline swings and caps orders via backend cap to prevent excessive inventory given high in-transit volume.

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 context: on-hand=0, in-transit=511. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (many concluded messages show lead_time=4). Demand regime shift at Period 13 raised mean demand substantially; recent periods remain in the higher regime. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time (reflects confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). Similarly use recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to capture volatility in the same recent window. This keeps ordering responsive to the higher demand while accounting for observed lead time and current pipeline (511 units) to avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 48 (Period_48) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 48. On-hand=0, in-transit=714. Historical conclude messages consistently show observed lead_time=4 (orders placed in P1..P47 that concluded arrived after 4 periods), so set L to calculated average (4). There is a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 13 (mean rose from ~52 to ~95, sustained many periods); to capture the current higher-demand regime I use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility (captures most recent behavior while smoothing noise). These choices give the OR backend an L that matches observed arrivals and mu/sigma focused on the recent high-demand regime, improving service (reduce stockouts) while letting the capped order cap limit excessive inventory and holding cost exposure.

Period 49 (Period_49) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_49: observed lead times from concluded messages consistently equal 4 periods (confirmed many times), and current on-hand=43 with in-transit=596. Demand regime shifted up starting Period_13 (+~83% sustained); recent demand is the best predictor. I set L by calculating observed lead times to match confirmed L=4. For demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent higher-demand regime while capping per rules). This ensures base_stock and cap reflect the elevated demand while acknowledging available pipeline (reducing unnecessary new orders and holding cost).

Period 50 (Period_50) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_50: demand has been in a higher regime since Period_13 (sustained). On-hand=87, in-transit=566 \u2014 pipeline large relative to recent demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility, use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures most recent stable regime while capping N per rules). These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking for the higher recent mean while using recent volatility to set safety stock; large pipeline reduces immediate agressive ordering risk.
