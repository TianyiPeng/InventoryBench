Decision: override OR and order to the computed base_stock (295 units). Reasoning: with promised lead time 4, an order placed now is the earliest replenishment that can reliably arrive to serve Period 5 demand and beyond. There is currently zero pipeline or on-hand inventory, so following OR's capped 71 would leave expected demand over the replenishment horizon (~248 units) unmet, causing large foregone profit (profit per unit $19 >> holding $1). Holding cost is small relative to lost-sales profit, so stocking up to the base-stock level to cover the (L+1)-period demand plus safety stock maximizes expected profit. I remain conservative about lost-shipment risk because there is no concluded evidence of lost orders or lead-time drift; if future conclude messages show late/missing arrivals, I will adjust.

Demand outlook: recent sustained regime shifts in carry-over insights show single-period demand ~175\u2013177 (Periods 41\u201345: 142,193,166,181,201 \u2192 mean \u2248176.6).

Risk management: holding cost is low relative to profit (q=0.95), so err on the side of having enough stock to avoid lost profit from stockouts in the final periods.

Timing implication: an order placed in Period 48 would arrive in Period 52 (after the 50-period horizon) and therefore cannot serve demand in Periods 48\u201350. Inventory & demand analysis: recent sustained demand regime is high (single-period avg \u2248174.6 over Periods 35\u201339 and recent periods ~181), so OR's base-stock logic aims to rebuild pipeline to cover ~5 periods (\u03bc\u0302\u22485\xd7174.6\u2248873 units). Current physical pipeline = on-hand (73) + in-transit (549) = 622 units, which is below that longer-run target but most importantly, any new order now would not arrive before the horizon ends. OR recommendation (142) assumes ordered units will arrive with promised lead time and be useful; given confirmed L=4 and only 3 periods left, those units would not help sales.
