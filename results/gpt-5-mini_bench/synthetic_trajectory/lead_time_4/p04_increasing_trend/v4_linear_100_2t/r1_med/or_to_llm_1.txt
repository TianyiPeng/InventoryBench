Inventory & demand: on-hand=380, in-transit=180 \u2192 pipeline total = 560 units. Carry-over insight notes a sustained demand regime shift earlier (recent sustained avg ~187.5 from P15\u2013P18) but more recent demands (P46\u2013P49 = 177, 0, 148, 338) are volatile.

Decision logic: required coverage for (L+1)=5 periods at the elevated avg 187.5 is ~938 units; we currently hold 560, a shortfall of ~378. Ordering that much would create large ending inventory risk if demand reverts or is volatile, incurring high holding cost ($1/unit/period) versus profit $4/unit. Given confirmed LT=4, existing pipeline of 180 will arrive on schedule and on-hand already covers multiple upcoming periods; with high holding penalty and demand volatility, I choose a conservative stance to avoid excess holding cost and potential overstock.
