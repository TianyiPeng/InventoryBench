I will follow OR's capped recommendation of 250 now to avoid over-ordering while awaiting evidence of actual lead time or lost shipments; once arrivals/conclude messages are observed in later periods I'll re-evaluate and top up if pipeline proves insufficient.

OR recommendation: 56 units (capped base-stock policy). Decision: follow OR's capped recommendation and order 56 now. Rationale for following: ordering now will arrive only after the long lead time and holding cost equals profit (discouraging excess inventory).
