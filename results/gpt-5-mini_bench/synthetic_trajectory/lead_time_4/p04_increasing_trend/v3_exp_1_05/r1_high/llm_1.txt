{
  "rationale": "a) World/product: single snack SKU; recent history shows a strong upward demand regime (periods 40\u201349 demand rising to ~1,000+ per period). b) Demand analysis: last 5-period avg (P45\u2013P49) \u2248 995 units/period and trend is upward. c) Lead time: confirmed as 4 periods from concluded messages. d) Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=4711 units. Requirement: cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. 5-period demand \u22485\xd7995=4975 units, current pipeline covers 4711 \u2192 short \u2248264 units. e) Order logic: place an order to cover the shortfall plus a small cushion for upward trend; keep order minimal to limit holding cost given high holding cost relative to profit. Order 540 units to ensure coverage of 5 periods with modest safety buffer.",
