No concluded arrivals or in-transit inventory; treat supplier as reliable but subject to the 4-period promise. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 0, In-transit = 0, so to cover the current period (demand happens after decision) plus the next 4 periods we need coverage for L+1 = 5 periods. e) Order logic: To balance stockouts vs high holding cost (holding cost = profit), I target roughly the 5-period demand using a conservative forecast biased toward recent higher demand. Forecast per period = 116 (rounded historical average) but placing modest upward bias toward recent regime gives ~116\u2013132; choose conservative midpoint of 116 to avoid excessive holding cost.
