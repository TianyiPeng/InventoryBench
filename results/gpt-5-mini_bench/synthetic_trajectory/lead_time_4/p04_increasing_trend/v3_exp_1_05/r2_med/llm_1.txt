Lead time: confirmed 4 periods (already recorded). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=3,950 (these are orders from P46\u2013P49 that will arrive during Period 50). Decision logic: with L=4, order now must cover demand for (L+1)=5 periods. Forecast 5-period demand \u22485\xd71,016=5,080. Current position (on-hand+in-transit)=3,950, so required order \u22485,080\u22123,950=1,130 units. This balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost ($1/unit/period).",
