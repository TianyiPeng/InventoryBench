Using initial samples from train.csv: D:\TextArena\examples\benchmark\synthetic_trajectory\lead_time_4\p05_decreasing_trend\v1_200_minus_3t\r1_med\train.csv
  Samples: [('Period_1', 217), ('Period_2', 207), ('Period_3', 170), ('Period_4', 131), ('Period_5', 185)]
  Mean: 182.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. Historical demand (5 samples) mean = 182 units/period, no concluded arrivals observed, on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no overdue shipments detected. Promised lead time=4 and no evidence to change it. Use default methods so backend sets L to promised 4 and computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 5*182 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps a baseline safety stock given limited data and avoids overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date Period_2. On-hand=0, in-transit=238 (order from P1 not yet concluded => cannot infer actual lead time). No concluded arrivals observed, so do not adjust promised lead time. Use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level using full-sample demand estimates while avoiding premature regime shifts given no sustained evidence of change.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 decision. On-hand=0, In-transit=482. No concluded arrivals in history (Period1/2 conclude show arrived=0), so actual lead time is not yet observable; possible delays but not confirmed. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on all provided samples to let the OR engine compute base stock and cap; this keeps parameters consistent until we observe concluded arrivals or a sustained demand shift.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_4: on-hand=0, in-transit=727 which equals the sum of prior orders (238+244+245). No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1-3 conclude all show arrived=0), so by rules we cannot confirm a lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid premature adjustments. Demand history (periods 1-5: 217,207,170,131,185) has mean=182; with L left as promised the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps the OR engine aligned with its assumptions while covering the (L+1) periods of demand given current pipeline, avoiding overreaction to unconfirmed delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5 start. Demand samples (Periods 1-5) show recent demands: 217,207,170,131,185 (mean ~182). On-hand is 0 with large in-transit=967 and four consecutive conclude messages showing arrived=0 \u2192 evidence of missing/delayed shipments but no concluded arrivals to formally infer a different lead time. I will keep L as default (promised lead time=4) so the OR backend uses contractual lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set. This is conservative: default L avoids overreacting to unconcluded arrivals, and default demand stats leverage all data while the large in-transit quantity implicitly covers multi-period demand. Monitor for concluded arrivals; if missing shipments persist I will update L explicitly.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-4 have not concluded (arrived=0) for 4 consecutive periods; potential lost/delayed shipments detected.

Daily Profit: $708.00, Daily Holding Cost: $61.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $647.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6 decision. Recent demand samples show mean=182 units/period (samples: 217,207,170,131,185). On-hand=61, in-transit=753; one concluded arrival (Period_5) shows order from P1 arrived with lead_time=4. Orders from Periods 2-4 remain unconcluded and may be delayed/lost\u2014pipeline appears large but uncertain. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (we have confirmed a 4-period lead time from P1\u2192P5). For demand I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all_samples (captures five-period coverage including lead time). For sigma_hat I use 'default' so backend computes volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service level (cover L+1 periods) against holding costs while accounting for confirmed lead time and current demand history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period_1 order arrived in Period_5, lead_time=4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $660.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_7 context: recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6). Demand samples (Periods1-5) mean=182, std\u224834. On-hand=112, in-transit=679 \u2192 pipeline_total=791 which is below (1+L)*mean demand (5*182=910), so we should replenish to cover the full review+lead horizon. I select L by calculation to reflect observed lead times, and use default demand/volatility rules (all-samples) because no sustained demand regime shift is evident across 5 samples. These settings let the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost given confirmed lead time and full-sample demand statistics.

Daily Reward (R_t): $653.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_8: on-hand=155, in-transit=627. Concluded arrivals show orders from P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7 => observed lead times = 4 for three orders (consistent). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the observed average lead time (4). Demand appears stable without a recent regime shift, so I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). These settings keep the base-stock aligned with confirmed lead time and historical demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $515.00

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9: recent observed demand samples (Periods 1-5) average 182 units/period; actual lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods by concluded arrivals (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). Current on-hand=213 and in-transit=594 provide healthy coverage. I will use the promised/default lead time (4) consistent with observed confirmations, and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) by basing base-stock on full-sample statistics while not overreacting to short-term noise; no explicit adjustments for missing shipments are needed because shipments have been confirmed on the 4-period cadence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $553.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_10: on-hand=79, in-transit=748. Historical demand samples mean=182 (periods 1-5). Concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1-P5 all show lead_time=4). Use L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time (avg observed =4). Use mu_hat='default' so backend sets (1+L)*mean_all = 5*182 = 910 demand across review+lead, aligning orders to cover the 5-period demand horizon. Use sigma_hat='default' so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std_all to reflect observed volatility. This keeps the policy consistent with confirmed lead time and historical demand while letting the OR engine apply its service-level cap; it also accounts for potential lost shipments by relying on concluded lead-time evidence rather than promised values.

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11: confirmed actual lead time = 4 from concluded history (P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Recent demand (Periods 6-10 = 193,202,182,158,188; mean=184.6) shows stable post-arrival regime. Set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Set mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime: (1+L)*mean of last 5 periods = 5*184.6 \u2248 923 forecast across review+lead. Set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding oversized safety stock given confirmed LT=4 and stable recent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $676.00

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12. Recent demand has been stable around prior periods (demands observed P1\u2013P11). On-hand=68, in-transit=701 \u2014 pipeline is large and several past orders show consistent 4-period arrivals, indicating actual lead time = 4. Many earlier delayed arrivals have now concluded, so use inferred lead time from observations. I select L="calculate" to let backend use the average observed lead times (consistent 4). For demand forecast and uncertainty I choose default rules so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all_samples respectively; this leverages full sample history while the calculated L captures the sustained lead-time regime and avoids overreacting to recent noise. This balances service (using confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13: recent demand has stabilized around mid-170s (Periods 8-12 demands = 182,158,188,186,158). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages. To reflect the confirmed LT and recent demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent stable regime (last 5 periods), balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_14. Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P9 all concluded with W=4). On-hand=119, in-transit=606 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand = 725 units, so no immediate shortage risk. Demand samples (seed data) show moderate demand; use calculated L to reflect confirmed lead time and default demand estimators to let OR backend apply full-sample mean/variance. This preserves service (profit $4 vs holding $1 encourages fill) while avoiding overreacting to short-term swings. Using 'calculate' for L encodes observed lead-time=4; 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples so the OR engine computes base-stock and cap accordingly.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current context: Period_15. On-hand=105, in-transit=680. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders from P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Recent demand (Periods 10-14) = [188,186,158,176,162], recent mean=174. To match confirmed lead time and recent demand regime, set L by averaging observed lead times and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (captures current lower/steady demand). This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent mean while the OR cap limits extreme orders given large pipeline, balancing service level (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: on-hand=188, in-transit=637. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders from P1..P12 arrived after 4 periods) so use observed lead time. Pipeline (637) plus on-hand comfortably covers upcoming demand, no evidence of new lost shipments. Profit=4, holding=1 implies high service target (q=0.8); using default demand estimates ((1+L)*mean) and default volatility lets OR backend compute base-stock and cap consistent with observed 4-period lead time while balancing fill rate vs holding cost.

No new sustained demand regime change in last samples (Period_1-5 demands: 217,207,170,131,185; later periods stable ~120-190). Some earlier missing shipments resolved; pipeline appears healthy. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $153.00

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27. Historical concluded arrivals show a stable observed lead time of 4 periods; recent demand samples (217,207,170,131,185) average 182 units/period. Current on-hand=295 and in-transit=492 (pipeline=787) provides coverage vs. upcoming demand. I choose to let the backend compute confirmed lead time from observed arrivals (calculate) and use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine uses the full sample mean while respecting the inferred lead time. This balances service (using observed lead time and full-sample mean) against holding costs given sizable on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period_28: observed steady lead time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals show orders take 4 periods). On-hand=321, in-transit=492 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand covers several periods of demand so no aggressive upshift needed. Use calculate for L to lock in observed lead time=4. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service vs holding cost given healthy on-hand and in-transit positions and confirmed LT=4.

Earlier missing/delayed shipments were resolved and lead time is stable at 4. I select L by 'calculate' to let the backend confirm average observed lead time (matches confirmed 4). Demand forecast and uncertainty use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available demand samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects full history and leverages confirmed lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 30 (Period_30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_30. Demand has been stable with historical samples and concluded arrivals consistently showing actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded messages: orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Current position: on-hand=366, in-transit=422. Given confirmed LT=4 and no recent sustained demand regime shift, use calculated lead time based on observed lead times to reflect reality and use default demand/volatility aggregating all samples so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps base-stock sized to cover (L+1) periods of demand (higher service) while relying on the backend cap to limit excessive ordering and control holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period_31. Current on-hand=380, in-transit=340. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving 4 periods after ordering (multiple confirmations P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), and earlier missing shipments have since concluded. I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the observed average lead time (evidence strongly supports L=4). I choose mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, giving a stable forecast that accounts for the 4-period lead time while balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Earlier missing/delayed shipments resolved; no ongoing lost-shipment signal. I set L using 'calculate' to lock in the empirically confirmed lead time=4.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014this balances service level (profit>holding) with holding cost given ample on-hand+pipeline and no evidence to shorten/lengthen L or change demand estimate.

Period 34 (Period_34) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_34: demand recently stable but lower than early periods; last concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed). On-hand=321, in-transit=411 -> sizeable pipeline (covers multiple periods). Given confirmed LT=4, I use recent demand (most recent 5 periods) to adapt to the current lower-demand regime and reduce excess inventory risk. L: calculate to lock in observed LT=4. mu_hat: recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on latest 5 demands. sigma_hat: recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility for safety stock calculation. This balances service level (using recent variability) against holding cost by avoiding overforecast from older higher-demand periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35: on-hand=304, in-transit=330. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5 etc.). Demand history shows stable variation around recent means. I use default lead time (promised=4, matches observed) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost using full-sample statistics.

Demand context: baseline sample mean=182 (samples: 217,207,170,131,185). I therefore use the promised/default lead time (L=4) consistent with observed confirmations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the historical samples; this provides a conservative replenishment target covering the review+lead horizon while letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

On-hand 337 + in-transit 393 = 730 units provide substantial buffer vs. expected (L+1) periods demand. No recent changepoint in demand or lead time requiring deviation from defaults.

A single non-arrival in Period_38 is noted but not yet a sustained loss. I set L via calculate to reflect the observed lead time (avg=4). Recent demand has trended lower versus early history, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (use last 5 demand samples) to adapt the (1+L) forecast and volatility to the current lower-demand regime, reducing excess holding while keeping service.

Daily Profit: $444.00, Daily Holding Cost: $365.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40. On-hand=365, in-transit=280. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time (stable across many periods). Demand samples (Period_1\u20135) show moderate mean/variance; no recent sustained demand regime shift detected. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirming L=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock target that accounts for the 5-period review+lead demand without overreacting to short-term noise. This keeps service high given high on-hand/pipeline while avoiding excessive holding cost increases.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41. On-hand=387, In-transit=373. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5 etc.), so I trust lead time=4. Pipeline + on-hand covers multiple periods of demand, no evidence of new lost shipments. I choose L by "calculate" to lock in the observed lead time average (4). For demand I use "default" mu_hat and "default" sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples\u2014this balances service level (using observed mean over the review+lead window) against holding cost given current healthy inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 42 (Period_42) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_42. On-hand=386, in-transit=311. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals with lead_time=4 (orders from Period N arriving in Period N+4), so use calculated lead time. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical sample set and yields a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost. Current pipeline + on-hand provides substantial coverage; no new prolonged losses observed recently.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43. Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded msgs: orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, etc.). On-hand=380, in-transit=322; no new prolonged losses. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the persistent 4-period lead time. Demand forecast and uncertainty use default methods ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples) so the OR backend applies full-sample demand stats with the confirmed lead time, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 44 (Period_44) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_44: on-hand=317, in-transit=418. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (many Period X conclude entries with W=4) though occasional non-conclusions suggest intermittent lost shipments; therefore set L method to calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Demand historical samples (provided seed) show mean ~182; to avoid overfitting to short-term noise I use default demand/volatility methods so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively, balancing service level vs holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45: observed on-hand=425, in-transit=306. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirms) and earlier transient missing arrivals have since resolved. Demand samples provided (Periods 1-5) used as environment seed. I choose default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This leverages the confirmed L=4 while letting the OR engine apply the full-sample mean/STD to balance service level (profit/holding cost) against holding costs given healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 46 (Period_46) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46. On-hand=412, in-transit=314. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent confirmations across history). Recent demand has been moderate and stable. I keep L at the promised/default (4) given repeated confirmations. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost with its calibrated z* and cap. This also avoids overreacting to short-term noise while acknowledging in-transit inventory.

Period 47. Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple arrivals labeled lead_time=4). On-hand=457, in-transit=261 -> healthy coverage. No new sustained demand or lead-time regime change detected. I will use default methods (promised lead time and population-based demand moments) so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps parameterization aligned with observed stable lead time and historical demand while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise or occasional missing arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Period 48: recent concludes consistently show arrivals referencing orders placed 4 periods earlier (repeated confirmations across history), so actual lead time = 4. Current inventory: on-hand=489, in-transit=220. Demand history shows moderate, stable demand; no sustained recent regime shift detected. I choose L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this balances service level and holding cost given stable demand and plentiful on-hand + pipeline inventory, and avoids overreacting to isolated missing arrivals earlier that are now resolved.

Demand has declined vs. early-period samples; last 5 periods (P45\u2013P49) show low demand (~63 avg). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and forecast demand using a recent_N (last 5) estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets base stock appropriate to the current low-demand regime.
