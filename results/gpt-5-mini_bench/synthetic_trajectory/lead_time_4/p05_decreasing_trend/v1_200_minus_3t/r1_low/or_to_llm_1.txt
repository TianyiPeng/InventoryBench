OR applied its cap and recommends 96. Recent demand has softened: last 5 periods (P13\u2013P17) demands = [176,162,163,125,124], average \u2248150 (\u224817% below the long-run 182). Holding cost equals profit, so overstock is costly. Pipeline already covers \u22484.32 single-period means (786/182) and, using the recent lower demand mean (~150), pipeline covers \u22485.24 periods, which is sufficient for (L+1)=5 periods. Therefore I trim the OR recommendation modestly to avoid excess holding: place 80 units (below OR's 96 but above zero to top up the pipeline and allow for variability).

However a sustained demand regime shift was previously recorded (Period 13: recent avg P13\u2013P17 = 150, \u221217% vs historical) and more recent periods show lower single-period demand (e.g., P22\u2013P26 average \u2248125). Given profit = holding cost (q=0.5 \u2192 no safety z*), objective is to minimize excess ending inventory while meeting expected demand. Using a conservative expected per-period demand of 150 (the sustained recent regime in carry-over), the 5-period demand \u03bc\u0302 = 5\xd7150 = 750. Desired order_raw = \u03bc\u0302 \u2212 pipeline = 750 \u2212 638 = 112. This brings total pipeline+on-hand close to expected 5-period demand without building extra inventory.
