  Samples: [('Period_1', 217), ('Period_2', 207), ('Period_3', 170), ('Period_4', 131), ('Period_5', 185)]
  Mean: 182.0, Count: 5
Promised lead time (shown to LLM): 4 periods
Note: Actual lead times in CSV may differ and will be inferred by LLM from arrivals.
Running full CSV horizon: 50 periods

Period 1 (Period_1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_1 start. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; historical demand samples show mean = (217+207+170+131+185)/5 = 182.0. No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time, so use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates. Set L=default to use promised 4-period lead time. Use mu_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples = 5*182.0 and balances expected demand over review+lead period. Use sigma_hat=default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples to reflect historical volatility. This avoids overreacting to limited early-period noise and leaves lead-time inference until concluded arrivals are observed.

Period 2 (Period_2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_2: on-hand=0, in-transit=238 (ordered P1, arrived=0 in P1 conclude). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; promised lead time (4) remains best default. Demand history available (periods 1-5) will be used by backend if default methods chosen. To maintain service with high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), use default forecasting (backend: (1+L)*mean, sqrt(1+L)*std) so orders cover review+lead demand while keeping holding exposure moderate given current in-transit stock and uncertainty about lost shipments.

Period 3 (Period_3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_3 start: on-hand=0, in-transit=482, two past orders (Periods 1\u20132) have not concluded/arrived. No concluded arrivals observed to infer a lead-time change; missing arrivals may be in-transit or delayed but not yet confirmed lost. Demand history shows moderate stable demand in available samples. To be conservative, use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses overall-sample statistics while the pipeline covers L+1 periods of demand. This balances service level (use pipeline + base stock) against holding cost given high profit per unit.

Period 4 (Period_4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 start. On-hand=0, In-transit=727 (matches orders 238+244+245). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is not observable; use promised lead time. Demand history (samples) available: [217,207,170,131,185]. To balance high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps orders sized by long-run demand while letting OR cap limit peak shipments given pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (Period_5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_5: recent demand samples (P1-P5) average 182 units/period. No arrivals have been observed for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (all arrived=0), and on-hand=0 with 967 in-transit, suggesting delayed or lost shipments but no concluded actual lead time yet. I retain the promised lead time (use default) because there are no concluded arrivals to compute an observed lead time. For demand parameters I use defaults: mu_hat default -> (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures aggregate demand across review+lead), sigma_hat default -> sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (captures observed variability). This keeps the OR engine anchored to full-sample stats while acknowledging possible shipment delays via conservative L choice.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-4 all show arrived=0 by Period_4 conclude (4 consecutive periods with no arrivals) despite 967 units reported in-transit\u2014indicates sustained missing/delayed shipments; possible lead time \u2265 promised or lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $3363.00, Daily Holding Cost: $61.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $3302.00

Period 6 (Period_6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_6: recent demand samples average 182 units/period (samples: 217,207,170,131,185). On-hand=61, in-transit=806; Period_5 conclude shows arrival of 238 units ordered P1 (lead_time=4) confirming promised lead time. Given confirmed lead time and stable recent demand, set L to calculate (use observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this yields replenishment sized to cover the (L+1)-period demand while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Daily Reward (R_t): $3555.00

Period 7 (Period_7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (observed P1\u2192P5 and P2\u2192P6). On-hand=112, in-transit=729; pipeline plus on-hand covers multiple lead periods. Demand history mean=182/unit (Periods 1-5). To align with confirmed lead time and stable recent demand, I use calculated L (average observed lead times) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes base stock using all samples over the full (1+L) review+lead horizon. This keeps safety stock responsive to observed variability while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise given no new sustained demand regime change. Using default sigma preserves backend's standard uncertainty scaling; this also helps buffer against any remaining in-transit loss risk without manually inflating forecasts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3683.00

Period 8 (Period_8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8: observed steady demand samples (Periods1-5 mean=182). On-hand=155, in-transit=675 with recent concluded arrivals confirming actual lead time=4. Given confirmed LT=4 and no sustained demand regime change, use estimated demand across review+lead as default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility. This keeps orders sized to cover 5 periods of typical demand while the OR backend caps order size to limit exposure from in-transit uncertainty.

Period 9 (Period_9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_9: recent demand samples (217,207,170,131,185) have mean=182 units/period. Lead time has been observed as consistently 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived with W=4). On-hand=213 + in-transit=640 = 853 units vs. (1+L)*mean target = 5*182 = 910, so pipeline is ~57 units short of the 5-period demand. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time=4. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L)=5; this balances service level (cover 5 periods of demand given confirmed L=4) against holding cost while acknowledging prior missing/delayed shipments are now explained by lead time=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2870.00

Period 10 (Period_10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10: confirmed actual lead time = 4 (observed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). Current on-hand=132 and in-transit=739; pipeline is large but arrivals are staggered by confirmed L=4. Recent demand (Periods 5\u20139 = 177,193,202,182,158) shows a sustained higher-run regime vs earlier samples, so I use recent data for forecasting. Choices: L set to calculate to let backend use observed lead times; mu_hat set to recent_N N=5 to capture current average demand over the review+lead horizon (weights the last 5 periods), and sigma_hat set to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This increases order targets to cover (1+L) periods of the recent demand regime while keeping variance estimate aligned to recent variability, balancing service level against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3461.00

Period 11 (Period_11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_11 context: on-hand=111, in-transit=675. Historical demand samples (periods 1\u20135) mean=182 units/period. Concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead time (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10) so use inferred lead time. I select L via 'calculate' to lock in observed lead-time=4. Use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this yields a 5-period forecast that matches the observed demand scale (\u2248910 units across lead+review) and keeps safety sizing aligned with historical volatility. This balances service (high profit per unit) against holding cost by leveraging the observed lead time and full-sample demand stats; current pipeline + on-hand already provides substantial coverage but the OR engine will cap orders appropriately.

Period 12 (Period_12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_12. Historical demand samples (P1-5) mean=182 units/period; actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods in history. Current on-hand=116 + in-transit=710 => pipeline covers ~5 periods of demand (1+L) at recent mean. No evidence of new demand regime; shipments have been arriving with 4-period lead time. Use calculated L to reflect observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to set base-stock and safety stock, balancing high service (large pipeline) against low holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2839.00

Period 13 (Period_13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_13: recent demand (P8-P12) averages ~174.4 units/period; observed concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=163, in-transit=693 so pipeline is healthy but lead time confirmation means orders placed now will arrive after 4 periods. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-stable regime (P8\u2013P12 mean=174.4) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the confirmed 4-period lead time and recent demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given high profit and low holding cost.

Period 14 (Period_14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14: confirmed sustained actual lead time = 4 (observed arrivals match orders placed 4 periods earlier). Current on-hand=163, in-transit=589 => pipeline+on-hand=752 units. Demand recent run (Periods 9-13) avg\u2248173.2; (1+L)=5 so use a 5-period recent window to capture current regime and avoid overweighting early samples. Set L by calculation (reflect observed lead times). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime and variance, balancing service level vs holding cost given high pipeline inventory and low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 15 (Period_15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Context: Period 15. On-hand=104, in-transit=654. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time. Pipeline (758) < target cover for 5 periods (default (1+L)*mean = 910), so backend should top up. Choices: set L=calculate to lock in observed lead time=4; use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and volatility from full sample set. This balances service level (uses confirmed LT and full-sample demand mean) vs holding cost by letting OR engine cap orders.

Period 16 (Period_16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_16: recent concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6 ... P11\u2192P15 arrivals). On-hand=167, in-transit=648 \u2014 pipeline well-stocked but arrivals are only visible after conclude delay. Given strong evidence actual lead time = 4, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend aligns promised vs observed. Demand samples (Periods 1\u20135) have mean ~182; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) provides a stable forecast over the full sample and leverages the OR engine's safety-stock math. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by using the backend's q-derived z* while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time and current pipeline.

Period 17 (Period_17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_17: recent demand samples (217,207,170,131,185) show mean ~182. On-hand=230, in-transit=636 (pipeline ample). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u22484. No new evidence of lost shipments since arrivals have been consistently arriving with 4-period lag. Choose L=calculate to lock in observed lead-time average (captures confirmed 4). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service-level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) with lower holding cost by relying on full-sample statistics given stable regime.

Period 18 (Period_18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18: on-hand=178, in-transit=685; profit=19, holding=1. Historical concludes show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (orders consistently arrived after 4). Pipeline is large relative to on-hand so do not inflate forecasts. Use default lead time (promised=4, confirmed by history) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps replenishment aligned with long-run demand estimates while the backend cap limits overly large same-period orders given the heavy in-transit volume, avoiding excessive holding cost if some shipments are delayed or lost.

Period 19 (Period_19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19. On-hand=201, in-transit=636. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (sustained evidence through Period 18), so set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time. Demand samples show no clear recent regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period_20: recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (many arrivals labeled lead_time 4); on-hand=249, in-transit=555. Demand samples exhibit moderate variability; no clear recent demand regime shift. Use calculated L to reflect observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), providing steady replenishment and accounting for pipeline. This cautious choice addresses past missing/delayed shipments by trusting observed lead time rather than promised shorter values.

On-hand=243, in-transit=548 \u2014 pipeline is large and covers multiple (L+1) periods. Profit/holding implies target service level ~95%; to let OR backend compute appropriate base-stock given promised lead time and full-sample stats, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the engine balances high service level against current large pipeline.

Current on-hand=202 + in-transit=609 = 811, which is below the 5-period demand forecast so pipeline is slightly short. I choose L=calculate to rely on observed lead times, and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (cover 5-period demand) while letting the backend apply the profit/holding tradeoff and its cap to avoid excessive ordering given holding cost=$1.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, giving a stable base-stock that balances the high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) while accounting for the 4-period lead time and maintaining service with existing large in-transit stock.

I choose default for L (use promised lead time = 4) and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This leverages the confirmed LT=4 and the full-sample demand statistics; current pipeline (218+617=835) is slightly below (1+L)\xd7mean (~910), so the backend will increase orders to restore coverage while accounting for high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

I set L via calculate to use observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent regime (captures the recent drop in demand). I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect current demand volatility.

Demand samples (217,207,170,131,185) show no sustained regime shift; use full-sample defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) vs holding costs without overreacting to short-term noise or transient delays.

Period 27 (Period_27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period_27: recent demand samples (mean=182 over provided 5 samples) and carry-over evidence confirm actual lead time = 4. Current on-hand=342, in-transit=451 (pipeline looks healthy). To balance high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) use conservative defaults: keep L as promised (and confirmed) to let OR backend use observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that reflects historical demand variability while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise or transient shipment issues.

Period 28 (Period_28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_28: current on-hand=371, in-transit=498. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no recent demand regime shift detected (demand varied but no sustained change). Pipeline plus on-hand provides buffer vs recent demand; some earlier missing arrivals were resolved and lead time confirmed, so use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates. Choosing L=default and mu_hat/sigma_hat=default lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history, balancing service level (using confirmed L=4) against holding cost without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 29 (Period_29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_29: recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) show mean demand 182 units/period; lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. Current on-hand=406 and in-transit=450 provide substantial coverage. I use default lead time (promised=4) because concluded history confirms LT=4. I select default mu_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples (captures long-run average demand across review+lead period). I select default sigma_hat so backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These conservative default choices rely on confirmed LT=4 and the full-sample demand stats to balance service level versus holding cost given high on-hand/pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period_30: recent demand samples (seeded by initial 5-sample history) show moderate levels; current on-hand=317, in-transit=536 (pipeline healthy). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods, so use promised/default lead time. No clear demand regime shift detected; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps orders aligned with long-run average demand while the large pipeline mitigates short-term stockouts and avoids excess holding cost.

I set L using calculate to confirm observed lead time from concluded history; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline safety stock aligned with the confirmed 4-period lead time and balancing service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period_32: demand has been stable with observed lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals match 4). On-hand=433 + in-transit=393 provides ample coverage vs expected demand. No current evidence of lost shipments. I choose L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm the observed average lead time from concluded history. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history\u2014this aligns safety stock with the backend service-level formula (high q\u22480.95 given profit/holding) while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33. Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (many concluded arrivals show W=4). On-hand=421, in-transit=418 (pipeline healthy). Demand samples (periods 1\u20135) mean=182; no sustained demand regime shift detected. To align OR backend with observed lead time and stable demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps forecast conservative given in-transit inventory and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while respecting confirmed lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34. Current inventory: on-hand=386, in-transit=416. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period lead time (confirmed in prior concludes), and recent demand has been stable/moderate (periods show typical demand ~80\u2013193). No sustained demand regime shift detected. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed system behavior and avoid overfitting to short-term fluctuations, I use the defaults: accept promised/confirmed lead time and let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample history. This leverages the full demand history while the pipeline+on-hand already provide substantial coverage.

Given stable lead time and limited sample set provided for demand, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (covers L+1 periods) against holding cost without overreacting to noise.

Historical concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals (confirmed lead time = 4) and no current evidence of lost shipments since Period 5 anomalies resolved by confirmations through Period 36. Demand samples (Period_1\u20135) used by default are representative; using promised/confirmed lead time keeps consistency with observed arrivals. I select default methods so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level (high profit $19) against low holding cost ($1) while leveraging confirmed L=4.

(ordered on Period Z, lead_time was 4 periods)'); no recent evidence of lost shipments. Profit/holding ($19/$1) implies high service target. I therefore set lead time to be inferred from observed data (calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which keeps the policy responsive to the confirmed 4-period lead time while letting the backend balance service level vs. holding cost.

Period 40 (Period_40) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40: on-hand=436, in-transit=347. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). No recent changepoint in demand signal; recent demands (history) are stable. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 4) since concluded arrivals match promise. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1) and preserves current pipeline coverage while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

Period 41 (Period_41) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_41: on-hand=460, in-transit=375. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand samples (Periods 1-5) have mean=182 and show no sustained regime shift. Given confirmed LT=4 and no new sustained demand change, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level vs holding cost without overreacting to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42: on-hand=458, in-transit=317. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed). Recent demand has been lower than earlier periods (last 5 concluded demands: P37-P41 = 101,69,111,54,110; mean\u224889). To keep pipeline sized to recent demand while respecting confirmed L=4, use promised/default lead time, and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 periods to adapt to the lower regime and reduce excess holding cost.

Period 43 (Period_43) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_43: on-hand=453, in-transit=221. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders from P1 arrived in P5, etc.). To reflect confirmed lead time I select L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times \u22484). Demand estimate uses 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and volatility uses 'default' (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine leverages full historical demand while accounting for the confirmed lead time; this balances service level (high profit) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44: on-hand=455, in-transit=358 (pipeline=813). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (confirmed earlier). No new sustained changepoints detected. I keep L as default (promised=4) to match confirmed observations. Use mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures baseline demand = 5\xd7mean historical). Use sigma_hat default so backend computes volatility from full sample set. These settings are conservative given confirmed LT=4 and current pipeline slightly below the (1+L)-period demand forecast, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 45 (Period_45) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period_45 decision: recent history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods (confirmed earlier). Current on-hand=500, in-transit=311 \u2014 ample pipeline. Demand context: stable historical demand with no recent sustained regime shift. I use default L to trust the promised lead time (4) which matches observed arrivals, and default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (maintain coverage for L+1 periods) versus holding cost given high on-hand inventory and low holding cost ($1). No aggressive increase in forecast to avoid excess holding.

On-hand=490, in-transit=317 \u2014 ample coverage vs. recent steady demand (historical samples mean=182). No sustained demand regime change detected. Use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L); this avoids overreacting to short-term noise while keeping service given confirmed L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $730.00

Period 47 (Period_47) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47: on-hand=429, in-transit=373. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods when arrivals recorded (many samples show lead_time=4); some isolated missed arrivals (Period_29, Period_46) but insufficient to overturn confirmed lead time. Demand history samples mean = (217+207+170+131+185)/5 = 182.0 per period. Using promised/confirmed L=4 and default demand/volatility methods keeps forecasting aligned with long-run data and the OR backend's assumptions; this balances high unit profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1) by relying on backend base-stock computation ((1+L)*mean) while not inflating safety stock due to isolated missing shipments. No explicit adjustments for possible lost shipments this period to avoid overreacting to sporadic gaps.

Demand history shows stable moderate demand with no recent sustained regime shift. Pipeline + on-hand comfortably cover upcoming (L+1) periods, so use default lead time and default demand stats to let the OR engine compute base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost.
