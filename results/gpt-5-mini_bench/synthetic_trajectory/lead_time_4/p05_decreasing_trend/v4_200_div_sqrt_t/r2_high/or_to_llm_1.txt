Step 2 - Demand & pipeline: Historical sample mean demand \u2248134.6 units/period (periods 1\u20135: 204,155,134,72,108). With promised L=4, (L+1)=5 period demand \u2248673 units. Current in-transit = 662 units, which essentially covers the next (L+1) periods' expected demand. On-hand = 0; holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit = $19/unit. Step 3 - OR recommendation comparison: OR recommends 203 units based on base-stock cap; that would push pipeline+on-hand well above expected demand and increase holding cost exposure, especially risky given delayed arrivals. Step 4 - Decision: Do not order now (order=0). Rationale: pipeline (662) \u2248 expected 5-period demand (\u2248673), so additional ordering risks unnecessary holding costs and reduces profit. Also avoid ordering while shipments are delayed/lost until we observe any concluded arrivals to update lead-time/pipeline certainty.

OR recommendation = 180 units (base-stock capped) but OR assumes promised lead time and reliable pipeline. Strategy: because pipeline is likely compromised and stockouts are very costly (profit $19 >> holding $1, q\u22480.95), I will augment OR's recommendation to partially rebuild a safe pipeline while limiting excessive inventory given uncertainty. I choose to order 400 units \u2014 more than OR's 180 to hedge against lost/delayed shipments and cover several periods of demand, but not the full 5-period forecast given the risk that additional orders may also be lost.

Demand outlook: recent 5-period average demand (Periods 44-48) = (1+63+43+25+33)/5 = 33 units/period. With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods after ordering => demand coverage target \u2248 5 \xd7 33 = 165 units.

Adjustment: add small safety buffer given high profit/low holding cost tradeoff; place order of 40 units to cover shortfall and modest safety stock while avoiding large holding costs from following OR's larger recommendation.

{

With L=4, only the P46 order (15 units) will arrive during this period; the remainder arrives in subsequent periods. Demand outlook: recent sustained lower-demand regime since Period 33 (~40\u201345 units/period vs. historical ~134), so single-period demand \u224840. Pipeline coverage: in-transit 127 \u2248 3 periods of current demand (127/40 \u2248 3.2), plus the P46 arrival adds 15 this period \u2014 total near-term supply adequate for ~3\u20134 periods. Cost tradeoff: profit per unit $19 vs holding cost $1/period \u2014 avoid unnecessary stocking given weak demand and significant pipeline. OR recommended 131 (uses promised L and historical highs); I lower to 0 because existing pipeline already covers several periods at current lower demand and placing 131 now would create excess holding cost.
