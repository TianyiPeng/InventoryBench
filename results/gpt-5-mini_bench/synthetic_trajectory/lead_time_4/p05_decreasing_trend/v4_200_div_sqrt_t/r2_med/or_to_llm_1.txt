Period 50 (Period_50) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (carry-over). Current in-transit=30 likely corresponds to the Period 46 order and will arrive during Period 50 (visible in Period 51), so pipeline_inventory = 30 to count against upcoming demand. Demand outlook: recent 5-period demands (P45\u2013P49 = 63,43,25,33,49) give mean = 42.6 and sample sd \u2248 14.7. For review+lead horizon (L+1 = 5) \u03bc\u0302 = 5\xd742.6 = 213; \u03c3\u0302 = \u221a5 \xd7 14.66 \u2248 32.8. Using critical fractile q = profit/(profit+holding) = 4/(4+1)=0.8 \u2192 z*\u22480.842. Base-stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 213 + 0.842\xd732.8 \u2248 241. Pipeline = 30 \u2192 uncapped order \u2248 211 units. OR recommended 131 (uses longer history and promised L); I increase the order because recent mean is materially higher than the long-run decline seen earlier and we have confirmed lead time = 4. Inventory cost is nontrivial, so I round to a whole number but avoid extreme overstock. Final action: order 210 units.",
