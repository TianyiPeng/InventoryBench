OR's capped policy recommendation (225) is much smaller due to its cap on order size; however, caps limit exposure at the cost of likely stockouts given current low pipeline. Given profit ($4) >> holding cost ($1), the cost of understock (foregone profit) outweighs holding costs; we prioritize avoiding stockouts. Therefore I order to bring expected pipeline closer to the computed base-stock: order \u2248905.7 \u2212 202 = 703.7, rounded to 704 units.

Even using a conservative mid-term demand of ~70 units/period, (L+1)=5 periods of demand \u2248350 units \u2014 well below current on-hand of 548. OR recommended 126 units based on promised lead time and historical high-demand samples; that recommendation ignores the sustained lower demand and current ample on-hand. Risk/financials: holding cost = $1/unit/period; excess ordering now would reduce objective (Profit\xd7units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost\xd7ending_inventory). Action: place no order to avoid unnecessary holding costs while on-hand covers expected demand through the lead time plus current period.
