Adjustment decision: I will follow the OR recommendation of 231 units. Reason: current pipeline plus OR order (422+231=653) still increases coverage but remains conservative relative to the uncapped base-stock (which would be much higher), and there is no confirmed lead-time shortening, lost shipment, or demand regime shift to justify a larger override.
