Recent realized demands since then remain low (single- to low-double digits up to ~107, centered well below the original sample mean). 3) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand = 284, in-transit = 84, total pipeline = 368 units. Expected demand over lead+review (L+1=5 periods) \u2248 5 \xd7 78.17 = 390.85 units, so pipeline is only ~23 units short of the 5-period expected demand. 4) Cost trade-off & OR recommendation: OR recommends 189 using promised L and historical mean; that would raise ending inventory and incur holding cost equal to profit ($1/unit), so extra units mostly increase holding cost with little net reward gain. Given the low-demand regime is sustained and we already hold large stock (284 on-hand), I avoid ordering to prevent costly holding. 5) Decision: order 0 units. This keeps inventory high enough to meet near-term demand while avoiding additional holding cost; monitor arrivals and demand to reconsider if pipeline falls materially below 5-period demand or if demand increases.",
