Pipeline (on-hand + in-transit)=194 < \u03bc\u0302 by \u224840. Risk tradeoffs: profit >> holding cost (q\u22480.95) so OR leans to higher safety stock, but we already have substantial pipeline and a lost-sale in Period 1 (demand 53 unmet). Ordering the full OR recommendation (179) would create large overhang when arrivals conclude, increasing holding cost if both shipments arrive; ordering zero risks persistent shortage over the 3-period horizon. Practical decision: top up the pipeline to cover the 3-period expected demand (\u03bc\u0302) rather than follow OR's larger capped order. Therefore order = ceil(\u03bc\u0302 - pipeline) = ceil(234.6 - 194) = 41 units (nonnegative).

In-transit equals 235 (194+41), so all outstanding orders remain in-transit with no arrivals by Period 4 conclude \u2014 this implies actual arrivals are delayed beyond the promised L=2 or shipments may be lost, but we lack definitive arrival evidence yet.

OR recommended 148 units (cap-adjusted base-stock using promised L), but that baseline assumed supplier performance per promise. Decision logic: because pipeline already contains \u2248235 units \u2014 roughly equal to the 3-period expected demand \u2014 placing additional order now would increase holding cost exposure if/when these in-transit units arrive. Conversely, there is risk if those in-transit units never arrive. Given only 3 conclude periods with zero arrivals (signal but not absolute proof of permanent loss) and the high holding cost sensitivity is low (holding $1 vs profit $19), the prudent action is to avoid adding to pipeline this period and monitor for arrival in the next conclude. Final action: order 0 units now, preserve cash and avoid unnecessary holding cost; if next conclude confirms arrivals are lost, escalate ordering then to rebuild pipeline.
