Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean demand \u224878.2/week with high variability (sd \u224862.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=2. No concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes and no sustained changepoint (the Jan 21 spike is a single-week outlier). To avoid overreacting to a one-week surge and given no evidence of lost/delayed shipments, use default lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L) scaling and variance treatment.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand observed: Period1 demand=53; historical sample mean=78.2 (samples: 15,50,198,60,68). On-hand=0, in-transit=194 (order placed in P1). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals observed yet \u2014 this is expected (order placed in P1 would arrive during Period3). No evidence of lead-time change or lost shipment. I therefore use default lead time (promised=2). For demand I use the default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect the multi-period exposure (L+1=3) given limited history and no confirmed regime shift. Volatility uses the default method (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These conservative defaults let the OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding overfitting to a single recent period spike (198) and account for the 3-period demand coverage required.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=373 (orders of 194 in P1 and 179 in P2). No concluded arrivals yet; this aligns with promised lead time L=2 because orders placed in P1/P2 would arrive during Periods 3/4 and not yet be visible in concludes. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change. Historical weekly demand samples: [15,50,198,60,68]. To let the OR engine apply its standard base-stock calculation using the promised lead time and the full sample history, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples. This balances service (using all data) vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=390 (orders from P1-P3: 194+179+17). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time not confirmed; shipments may be delayed but insufficient evidence to change promised lead time. Historical demand samples (weekly): [15,50,198,60,68], mean ~78.2. Promised L=2 remains best prior. Use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters linked to long-run sample stats while the existing in-transit pipeline (390) already covers several weeks of expected demand; default L/mu/sigma avoids overreacting to delays and balances service-level (profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Daily Profit: $1425.00, Daily Holding Cost: $104.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1321.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows a confirmed actual lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). Current on-hand=104, in-transit=211 (these correspond to outstanding orders from Period1 and Period3). Order from Period1 (194 units) has not concluded by its promised arrival (would have arrived in Period3) and appears missing, but this is not yet a 3+ period sustained pattern so I will not treat it as confirmed lost. Demand history (5 samples: 15,50,198,60,68) gives mean\u224878.2. To balance service level vs holding cost (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 high service target), I will keep the backend defaults: use the promised/calculated lead time and full-sample statistics so the OR engine computes base stock and cap using all available data while accounting for L. This also avoids overreacting to a single overdue shipment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=37, in-transit=269. Historical demand samples (weekly): [15,50,198,60,68] mean=78.2. Concluded arrival evidence shows an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 => observed lead time = 2 periods. No sustained demand regime change detected. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time (reflecting the confirmed 2-period lead). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7overall mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7overall std from all samples; this balances service level (covers L+1 periods) versus holding cost given current pipeline and no new demand pattern.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand sample mean (historical) ~78.2; no sustained demand regime change detected. Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at default (use full-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L) so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost given current pipeline coverage.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed 2 in Period4 and 1 in Period6) so use calculated average lead time from observed data. Recent on-floor demand has fallen across Periods 4-7 (75,67,51,32) and current inventory is high (on-hand 12 + in-transit 306). To avoid over-ordering, forecast based on the most recent demand regime (last 4 periods) for both mean and volatility so the OR engine sets a prudently low replenishment target reflecting the downward trend and large pipeline. Choices: L by calculate (average observed lead times); mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N with N=4 to capture the recent decline in demand and lower variability, preventing unnecessary orders given the large in-transit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=87, in-transit=211. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (observed W={2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8)}), suggesting actual lead time is between 1\u20132. To balance service level vs holding cost I ask the backend to use calculate for L (average observed lead time) so the engine infers L\u22481.5 from concluded arrivals. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages full historical demand while letting the computed L adjust the replenishment horizon. This approach addresses mixed/variable arrivals and avoids overreacting to short runs of delays or early arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has declined from ~75-88 in earlier periods to 32,20,17 in the last three weeks; on-hand=70 and large in-transit=241 so we should avoid aggressive replenishment. Lead time historically shows 2 periods (confirmed in carry-over). I set L explicit=2 to reflect confirmed lead time. I use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period demand estimate and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime (captures the drop starting Period 7). This reduces order targets given high pipeline and low recent demand, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent concluded history shows mixed observed lead times (1 and 2 periods) but promised lead time is 2 and prior carry-over recorded confirmation at Period 6; on-hand=87 + in-transit=211 gives 298 units in pipeline/on-hand which currently looks ample versus historical averages. I choose to use the promised lead time (L=default=2) to keep the OR engine aligned with contract lead time and prior confirmation. For demand forecast I use default historical estimate (mu_hat=default) based on all provided samples ((1+L)\xd7mean) to avoid overfitting to short recent declines; sigma_hat=default uses historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These conservative defaults balance service (using L=2) while avoiding excess inventory from recent short-term dips; with profit=$19 and holding=$1 the backend will set a high service quantile but our chosen mu/sigma prevent aggressive upward adjustments based on transient noise.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period transit but overall average lead time >1; choose L=calculate to let backend use the observed average. Inventory on-hand=70 + in-transit=221 = 291 units of pipeline; this is ample relative to recent weekly demand (historical sample mean ~78/week from provided samples and recent realized weekly demands mostly <100). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it derive base-stock while respecting the inferred average lead time and avoiding manual downshift that could risk stockouts if some shipments are delayed.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=45, in-transit=229 (ample pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (observed W=2,1,2,1,1 across concluded arrivals); average observed lead time \u22481.4 \u2192 use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history (periods 1\u201312) shows mean \u224844.8 units/week and moderate volatility; with sufficient history and no clear sustained regime shift, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding overreacting to short-term variability given large in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history confirms lead time \u22482 periods (arrivals from P11\u2192P13, P2\u2192P4). On-hand=41, in-transit=237 (pipeline=278) \u2014 ample cover vs historical demand samples (mean weekly=78.2). To avoid overreacting to noisy 1-period arrivals and because pipeline is large, use promised/default lead time and population-based demand estimates: L=default to keep backend using promised 2; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (stable historical mean); sigma_hat=default to use population volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps orders conservative given high pipeline and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has declined sharply since Period 7. On-hand=42, in-transit=235 (pipeline=277) \u2014 ample cover vs recent low demand but lead times have varied (1\u20132). I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of all observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 results). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 8\u201314) because a sustained lower-demand regime is evident; this keeps forecasts responsive and avoids overstock. Sigma uses recent_N N=7 to reflect recent lower variability. These choices bias the OR backend toward lower base stock (reducing holding cost) while respecting observed lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg decreased from 69.0 to 18.1 (-73.7%)

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history shows lead times of 1\u20132 periods with more 2-period observations recently; demand has been in a lower regime since Period 7 (confirmed in carry-over). On-hand 36 + in-transit 235 provide ample pipeline coverage, but lower demand regime argues for using recent demand statistics. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend average). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 7\u201315 = 9 periods). sigma_hat uses the same recent_N window to reflect current volatility. These choices reduce forecasted replenishment compared with long-run averages, lowering holding cost while preserving service for the confirmed lower demand regime and addressing mixed lead-time evidence via calculate.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 7 (carry-over notes a sustained drop). On-hand=32, in-transit=235 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to current low demand; no new evidence of lead-time degradation (recent concluded arrivals show 1\u20132 periods). Use promised lead time to align with contract, and use recent_N (most recent regime) for demand estimates so the OR backend reduces target stocking to the new lower-demand regime.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 7 (average ~14.64/week over P7\u2013P17). Current on-hand=26 and in-transit=235 \u2192 pipeline=261 units, which already materially covers multiple weeks of demand (\u2248261 / 14.64 \u2248 17.8 weeks). Promised lead time = 2 periods; observed lead times have been 1\u20132 but no sustained change; keep promised lead time. To reflect the confirmed lower-demand regime, set demand estimates using the recent regime (use last 11 periods P7\u2013P17). Methods chosen: L=default to respect contract/promised lead time; mu_hat = recent_N (N=11) to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean over the recent low-demand regime; sigma_hat = recent_N (N=11) to capture recent volatility. This reduces replenishment aggressiveness given large existing pipeline and lower demand, lowering holding cost while preserving service from ample inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). Recent demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 7 (post-change avg ~18.1/week). Current inventory: on-hand=22, in-transit=235 (sufficient coverage). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132); using calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N=12 (periods 7\u201318) to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the new low-demand regime (N=12 equals regime length). This keeps target base stock aligned with the sustained lower demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability; together they reduce excess ordering given large pipeline and $1 holding cost versus $19 profit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 7 (carry-over recorded). On-hand=20 and in-transit=235 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to current weekly demand. Promised lead time remains appropriate. I select L=default to use promised 2-period lead time. For demand, I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the post-changepoint low-demand regime (Periods 7\u201319 \u2248 13 samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent low-demand data; this reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding given high pipeline inventory.

Recent demand has been low since Period 7 (carry-over noted), so I will use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses the full-sample statistics adjusted by (1+L). This avoids forcing extra orders now given large in-transit quantity and downward demand regime.

Promised lead time = 2 and prior confirmed evidence supports using the promised/default lead time. To align the forecast with the persistent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 15 periods since the changepoint (Periods 7\u201321) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new lower mean and observed volatility while avoiding overstock given high pipeline levels. This balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 7 (carry-over notes: avg decreased from 69.0 to 18.1). On-hand=16, in-transit=235 \u2014 ample pipeline but observe many past arrivals/concludes showing lead time ~2. To avoid overstock while preserving service, use recent-demand estimates (focus on the post-changepoint regime). Set L to default (promised 2). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent low-demand regime length (~Periods 7\u201324 => 18 samples) so the OR engine sizes orders for the new lower mean and volatility while capping orders via its cap rule.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting at Period 7 (carry-over: avg fell from 69.0 to 18.1) and earlier evidence confirmed actual lead time = 2 (Period 6). On-hand=10, in-transit=235 (large pipeline). To avoid overstocking given high pipeline and low recent demand, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the entire low-demand regime (Periods 7\u201325, N=19) so the OR backend will target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility reflecting the new lower demand and reduce ordering despite the large in-transit. This balances high profit-driven service level (q\u22480.95) against holding cost and prevents excess stock from the large pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=235. Historical conclude messages confirm persistent lower-demand regime since Period 7 (carry-over). Promised lead time=2 and prior confirms support using default L. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (regime length ~20 periods from P7\u2013P26). This keeps forecast and variability focused on the recent low-demand behavior so the OR backend reduces orders and avoids holding cost while meeting service needs given 235 units already in transit.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 7 (sustained lower weekly demand); on-hand=0, in-transit=235 units (pipeline large). Promised lead time = 2 periods; historical concluded lead times have been 1\u20132 but earlier confirmation at Period 6 supported 2. I use L=default to keep OR engine aligned with promised lead time. Demand forecasting uses recent_N to focus on the post-changepoint low-demand regime (use last N samples from the current regime) so base stock is not inflated by earlier high winter/spring values. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=20) to capture the current low mean and volatility; this reduces excess ordering and holding cost while maintaining service given the large in-transit position.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Demand dropped sharply at Period 7 and has remained low (carry-over notes). On-hand=0, in-transit=235 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent low demand, so avoid inflating safety stock. Promised lead time = 2 (use default). For demand forecast I use recent regime statistics: recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (regime length ~22, capped at 20). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 to capture current volatility. These choices keep mu_hat/sigma_hat anchored to the new low-demand regime and prevent over-ordering given the large in-transit position.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=235 units. Promised lead time=2 and historical concluded lead times include 2 (confirmed earlier). Demand showed a sustained drop around Period 7 (carry-over recorded) but the last 5 weeks (Periods 25-29: 6,21,32,42,37) show a recent uptick vs the earlier low regime. To capture the current short-term demand level and volatility, I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets base stock to reflect the most recent 5-week mean/variance over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. I keep L=default (promised lead time=2) because concluded lead-time evidence is mixed but earlier confirmation exists and no new sustained lead-time change is observed. This balances service (capture recent demand rise) while avoiding overstating demand from older high-variance samples.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=235. Recent history shows large unmet demand spike (Periods 27-30) but confirmed lead time previously = 2. Profit per unit >> holding cost, so avoid aggressive cuts to target stock. Use default lead time (promised 2) and default demand stats (use all historical samples) so the OR backend computes base-stock from long-run mean; default sigma to reflect full-sample volatility. This keeps service focus given high profit while avoiding manual under/over-adjustment based on recent noisy spikes or potential lost shipments.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent demand has surged: last 5 weeks (Periods 27-31) demands = [32,42,37,123,139], average \u224874.6 vs prior post-changepoint mean 18.1. On-hand=0, in-transit=235 (pipeline present but multiple prior periods showed no arrivals\u2014possible delays/lost shipments). No new concluded arrivals to change lead-time estimate, so keep promised lead time. To react to the recent sustained demand spike I set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks (captures the surge) and match volatility to that window; this raises base_stock to reduce imminent stockouts while accepting modest holding cost tradeoff given high profit/holding ratio (profit=19 vs holding=1).

Carry-over insight: Recent demand surge confirmed at Period 27-31: avg increased from 18.1 (post-Period7 regime) to 74.6 (+312%), sustained 5 periods (Periods 27-31).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Use promised lead time (default) but forecast demand using the recent surge regime to avoid stockouts given strong recent demand; choose recent_N N=5 to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the 5-period surge. This balances service (capture surge) vs holding cost by relying on in-transit inventory and a short (default) L.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand surge: Periods 27-31 avg=74.6 (confirmed), plus very high demands in P32=121 and P33=216 \u2014 regime remains elevated. On-hand=0, in-transit=417 (outstanding orders cover upcoming arrivals but not yet observed). No new evidence of lead-time change since lead time was previously confirmed as 2. Choose L=default (use promised lead time=2). For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent elevated regime (Periods 27-33, regime length=7) so mu_hat uses recent_N N=7 to reflect the new higher mean across the review+lead period. Match sigma_hat to recent volatility with recent_N N=7. These choices prioritize service during an ongoing surge while avoiding reliance on older low-demand data; using recent_N for sigma captures current volatility and prevents understocking despite delayed arrivals.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=499. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 periods earlier (Period 6 insight) and a sustained demand surge starting Period 27 (Periods 27-34 show elevated demand). To capture the confirmed lead time I request the backend compute the empirical average ('calculate') from observed lead-time concludes. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher recent regime (Periods 27-34, regime length 8); to reflect this I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the surge and avoid underordering into the elevated demand. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit demand and recent high demand) while controlling holding cost by using a recent-sample estimate rather than the long-run mean.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=33, in-transit=366; recent weeks (Periods 27-35) show a sustained demand surge versus the prior low regime (recent avg \u2248 74.6 over P27-31 and continued high demand through P35). There is one anomalous longer arrival (P32\u2192P35 = 3) but lead-time evidence is mixed, so keep L as promised to avoid overfitting. To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the latest 9 demand samples (covers P27\u2013P35) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet the surge. Use sigma_hat recent_N with the same N=9 to reflect increased variability. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts during confirmed surge) while sigma scaling tempers excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand surge: periods 27-36 show elevated demand (Periods 32-36: 121,216,139,104,90). On-hand=0, in-transit=408 (covers multiple future periods). Recent arrivals show actual lead time has stretched to 3 periods (orders from P32->P35 and P33->P36). To be conservative and match recent higher demand, set lead time L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to focus on latest high-demand regime (Periods 32-36). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These params prioritize service during the sustained surge while backend caps orders to limit excess inventory given large in-transit stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=0, in-transit=624. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 27 (surge through Periods 27-37). Recent observed lead times include several 3-period arrivals (orders placed P32->arrived P35, P33->P36) indicating occasional longer-than-promised transit. To balance service vs holding cost: (1) set L using recent observed lead times to capture the recent upward drift; (2) set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand samples to reflect the sustained high-demand regime (use last 11 periods to cover the post-surge behavior). The in-transit volume (624) is large and will be considered by the OR engine when computing pipeline_inventory; parameters aim to reflect current demand and slightly longer realized lead times so orders won't undershoot while shipments are outstanding.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=123, in-transit=408 (pipeline=531) which is large versus recent weekly demand spikes. Historical observed lead times vary (1\u20133 periods); to let backend reconcile variability I select L='calculate' (use avg observed lead times). Because demand history contains distinct regimes (low mid-year then surge starting Period 27) but we currently have large pipeline, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this avoids overreacting to short recent spikes while the pipeline clears.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows large demand surge from Periods 27-31 sustained into early fall and highly variable actual lead times (observed concluded lead_times = {2,1,2,1,2,2,3,3,1,1,3}, mean \u22481.91). Current inventory: on-hand=151, in-transit=317 (sizable pipeline covering multiple periods). Given profit/holding implies a high target service level (q\u22480.95) the OR backend should compute base stock accordingly. I set L to the observed-average (calculate) to reflect actual supplier performance rather than the promised 2. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses the full-sample (1+L) scaled mean and sqrt(1+L) scaled std \u2014 this balances responsiveness to the large-sample seasonal pattern while letting the backend apply the high service-level z. No specific overdue/lost shipment pattern requires forcing an explicit L or forecast override now because the average observed lead time is near 2 and pipeline is healthy.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent history shows a sustained demand surge beginning at Periods 27-31 (carry-over) and continuing through Periods 32-40 with consistently high weekly demand (Period32-40 demands: 121,216,139,104,90,89,93,63,56). On-hand=95, in-transit=317 (pipeline sizeable). Promised lead time remains 2 and prior conclude messages support ~2 periods on average; no new sustained lead-time change. I choose L=default to use promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (covering Periods 27\u201340, regime length=14) to capture the new higher-demand regime; this makes mu_hat reflect the elevated average over the recent surge. I also set sigma_hat=recent_N N=14 to capture current volatility. These choices align the backend base-stock forecast to the sustained higher demand while the large pipeline + on-hand helps avoid stockouts; using recent samples prevents under-forecasting from older low-demand periods while keeping holding costs in check given on-hand and in-transit stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25. On-hand=50, in-transit=337. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,1,2,2,3,3,1,1,3 \u2192 avg\u22481.83) so I set L by calculating the average observed lead time to capture this variability. Demand has been elevated recently (sustained surge from Periods 27\u201331 and high demand through Periods 35\u201341); to reflect the recent regime I use a recent_N forecast for mean and volatility using the last 10 demand samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat weight recent high demand while limiting noise from older low-demand periods. These choices raise base_stock to improve service during the sustained high-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N tightens safety-stock sizing around current variability.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=396. Recent weeks (Periods 37-42) show elevated demand (89,93,63,56,45,168) after the surge starting Period 27-31. Lead-time observations now include multiple 3-period arrivals (P32->P35, P33->P36, P36->P39), so I treat current effective L as 3 to avoid under-ordering. Set L explicit=3 to force the OR engine to plan for the longer arrivals. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses the most recent demand regime (Periods 37-42) when computing base_stock and cap; this balances higher service level for the recent surge while keeping holding cost in check given large in-transit pipeline and longer lead time.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 32 with large weekly demands (many weeks >60), and carry-over confirmed actual lead time previously as 3 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=469 (large pipeline). I select L="calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (captures mixed 1\u20133 period observations). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand weeks (reduces dilution from earlier low-demand regime) and keep variability aligned with current volatility. These parameters balance service (capture recent surge) against holding cost given the already-large pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=469 \u2014 large pipeline from recent replenishments. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time empirically shifted to 3 periods (multiple observations P32->P35, P33->P36, P36->P39). Demand recently surged and remained elevated in the last 5 concluded weeks (Periods 40-44 demands = 56,45,168,65,46; recent mean \u224876). To avoid over-ordering given a long confirmed lead time and a large in-transit position, I explicitly set lead time to 3 and use recent demand (N=5) to capture the current high-regime mean and volatility so the OR backend sizes orders to cover (L+1) periods of current demand while capping order size via its cap rule.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent history shows confirmed longer lead time (multiple observations in Periods 32-39 and 43) so I set lead time to 3. On-hand=67, in-transit=324 (large pipeline). Demand has been elevated and more volatile since the surge beginning Period 27, with especially high turns from Period 32 onward; to keep the OR backend responsive to the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 10 demand samples for both mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects current higher demand while the existing large pipeline limits new ordering risk.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=372. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u22483 periods (observed P32->P35, P33->P36, P36->P39, P42->P45). Recent demand has been elevated in the last 6 periods (Periods 41-46: demands = 45,168,65,46,85,93) indicating a sustained high-demand regime through December. I set L explicitly to 3 to align with observed lead-time evidence. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime (short horizon holiday surge) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 6 samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=6) so volatility matches recent variability. These choices aim to raise target base-stock to avoid stockouts during the confirmed longer lead time and elevated holiday demand while keeping safety stock tied to observed recent variability.
