Calendar date 2019-02-11 \u2014 still winter, no major immediate retail holiday that should sharply reduce demand. Historical demand (provided): 2019-01-07:15, 01-14:50, 01-21:198, 01-28:60, 02-04:68. The series is noisy with one large spike (198 on 01-21) but the most recent two weeks average ~64 units/week, and the 5-week mean is ~78 units/week. Demand regime appears stable recently (no sustained run of >3 periods at the 198 level), so base forecast on the recent two-week average (~64).\n\nLead time & pipeline: Promised lead time = 2 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time. Must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after ordering). Therefore target coverage = 3 \xd7 forecast per period.\n\nInventory/ordering logic: Using forecast 64 units/week \xd7 3 = 192 units to provide reasonable service while keeping holding cost low relative to high per-unit profit (Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1 per period). This balances risk of stockout against holding cost given limited history and a single transient spike.\n\nFinal decision: order 192 units (arrive in Period 3 under promised lead time).",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 45 is 2019-12-16 (pre-Christmas), likely elevated demand for apparel. Lead-time evidence: recent concludes confirm actual supplier lead_time = 3 periods. Demand regime: since Period 28 demand has shifted to a high regime (Periods 28\u201336 avg \u2248112/wk) with continued large weekly spikes (P42=168, P43=65, P44=46). Service-level logic: with LT=3 we must cover L+1 = 4 future weeks of demand. Forecast ~100 units/week conservatively given holiday volatility and recent averages -> 4*100 = 400 units target coverage. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 316 \u2192 need 400 - 316 = 84 units to reach target. Holding vs profit: holding cost $1/period vs profit $19 favors filling demand rather than risking stockouts during holiday. Order placed now will arrive in Period 48 (three-period lead time).",

{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar & product: SKU is a knitted long-sleeve fitted top (seasonally relevant for fall/winter). Current date 2019-12-23 is late-December (holiday season) when demand can be elevated for knitwear; recent weeks show high demand. b) Demand regime: Historical carry-over shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 28 with avg \u2248112/week (Periods 28\u201336 and onward). Recent observed weekly demands include several 80\u2013216 samples; use conservative forecast \u2248112 units/week. c) Lead time & missing orders: Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (P32\u2192P35, P36\u2192P39). Several earlier orders were lost/unreliable, but recent pattern supports LT=3. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=400 units (these in-transit shipments are outstanding and expected under LT=3). With LT=3, decision must cover L+1=4 weeks of demand. Target coverage = 112*4 = 448 units. Current supply (on-hand + in-transit) = 400 \u2192 shortfall \u224848 units. e) Final order logic: Place a modest order to cover the 4-week protection interval accounting for confirmed LT=3 while avoiding excessive holding cost. Order quantity rounded to 50 units.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-30: late December/holiday season can keep demand elevated. Historical demand shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 28 (periods 28\u201346 mostly large weekly demand, recent weeks ~50\u2013100 with spikes to 168). Lead time inference: actual supplier lead time = 3 periods (confirmed: P32\u2192arrived P35; P36\u2192arrived P39; P40\u2192arrived P43), so orders placed now would arrive in Period 50. Inventory assessment: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 450 units which is sufficient to cover multiple weeks of current high demand (forecast ~80\u2013100/wk; L+1=4 periods \u2192 ~320\u2013400 units). To avoid excess holding cost and because pipeline already covers expected demand given confirmed LT=3, place no new order this period.",
