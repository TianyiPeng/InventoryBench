Recent demand regime: a large regime shift was already recorded (Periods 32\u201335 avg \u2248209) and subsequent weeks show high but variable weekly demand (periods 36\u201345 demands: 126,194,179,124,95,71,149,71,60,59). Given the confirmed L=2, any order placed now would not arrive until Period 48 (visible later), and we already have substantial pipeline inventory sufficient to cover several high-demand weeks (761 units >> typical weekly spikes ~150\u2013200). Cost trade-off: profit per unit = $19, holding = $1/period; unnecessary ordering increases holding cost with little benefit.
