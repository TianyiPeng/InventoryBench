OR recommendation=36 (based on promised L=2 and full-sample stats).\nLead-time & arrivals: no concluded arrivals in history to contradict promised L=2; treat supplier lead time as 2 for planning but remain alert for lost shipments.\nDemand analysis: full-sample mean = 13.2 units/period -> OR's base_stock \u2248 (1+L)*13.2 = 39.6. Recent 3-period mean (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) = (13+27+26)/3 = 22.0 units/period, indicating an upward regime vs earlier zeros.

Given zero on-hand/in-transit and a clear 3-period uptick (sustained over three periods), I increase coverage above OR to better match the recent regime while avoiding an excessive one-time order. I choose a compromise order of 40 units: this raises expected coverage toward the recent-demand-based base_stock (66) but mitigates risk of overstock if the spike is transient.\nFinal action: order 40 units for SKU 660726001 (placed in Period 1).",
