Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward shift (samples: 0,0,13,27,26) \u2014 last 3 weeks average = 22 units/week. No concluded arrival history (on-hand=0, in-transit=0), promised lead time=2. Use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimate on the most recent regime (last 3 weeks) to capture the recent increase while keeping variance estimate recent as well. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost by not over-weighting older zero-demand weeks.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=35 (ordered P1 arrived=0). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so do not change L. Demand in Period1 spiked to 60 versus historical samples (0,0,13,27,26) \u2014 single large observation suggests recent uplift but is not yet a sustained regime. Use EWMA to weight the recent spike while retaining historical baseline (gamma=0.5). Keep sigma_hat default until variance shift is confirmed. This balances service (respond to possible demand rise) against holding cost given profit=holding so target service quantile moderate.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent realized demand shows sharp uptick (Period1 demand=60, Period2 demand=146) versus earlier samples (2019-02-04=26). On-hand=0, in-transit=114; two recent orders (P1:35, P2:79) have not yet concluded \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time yet (promised L=2 still used). To respond to the apparent recent demand rise while remaining conservative, I use default lead time (promised=2), and base demand estimates on the most recent short window (captures the uptick) using recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend increases the base-stock and accounts for higher variability. This balances service-level (avoid stockouts given the spike) against holding cost given limited on-hand and sizable in-transit stock.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=232 but concluded history shows no arrivals for the Period 1 order (ordered on P1, arrived=0) indicating at least one missing/delayed shipment; however evidence is not yet a sustained multi-period pattern. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3) is much higher than the older sample mean: recent mean = (60+146+102)/3 = 102.67 units/week. To capture this regime shift I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods (conservative above promised 2 to allow for delays), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods so the OR backend targets supply for the elevated demand over the review+lead horizon. This increases service (reducing stockouts) while accepting higher holding given profit and holding costs are equal.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical small-sample baseline (Jan) shows low demand, but recent periods 1-4 exhibit a sustained higher regime (demands: 60,146,102,104). One concluded arrival shows an actual lead time of 2 (Period2 order arrived Period4); two other orders remain unarrived and may be lost but evidence is not yet >=3 periods. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand (last 4 concluded periods). For lead time I use calculated average of observed lead times (observed = 2). Using recent demand/volatility will raise the base stock to meet current demand while calculate L=2 aligns the pipeline horizon with observed delivery.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (ordered on Period 2, arrived on Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has risen sharply since Jan (series: 60,146,102,104,95) indicating a new higher-demand regime vs earlier Jan samples. Confirmed lead-time evidence (Period 4 conclude: order on P2 arrived P4) supports using observed lead time. On-hand=0 and in-transit=327 covers multiple periods of demand; using recent 5 periods for demand estimates captures the current regime while avoiding stale Jan zeros. Choices: L set from observed lead times (calculate) = 2; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the elevated, recent demand pattern and to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the recent regime. This balances service (avoid stockouts given current high demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Recent concluded demands (Periods 4-6) = [104,95,79], indicating a sustained higher-demand regime vs earlier samples. Lead time evidence: confirmed 2-period lead time from Period 5 carry-over. I set L via 'calculate' to use observed lead times (matches confirmed 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 4-6) to capture the new higher-demand regime: mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean(last3) to cover review+lead demand. For volatility I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals) while letting the OR backend cap orders via its policy.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical early samples (Jan) show low demand but last 4 concluded periods show sustained high demand: Periods 4-7 demands = [104,95,79,105], avg \u224895.8. Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 2. I set L to default (promised lead time=2). To capture the recent demand regime shift I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 samples) and for sigma_hat recent_N N=4 (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 4 samples). This places base stock around the recent high demand while keeping volatility estimated from the same recent window, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given confirmed lead time and large in-transit position.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=327; recent demand (Periods 5-8) = [95,79,105,114], avg=98.25. Prior samples (early Jan/Feb) are older and a different regime. Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods; using promised/default L=2. To size replenishment to current demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 4 demand observations (N=4) so (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect recent weeks and avoid overweighting early low-volume samples. This balances service level (meeting ~98epw demand) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has jumped and stabilized since early Mar: Periods 4\u20139 demands = [104,95,79,105,114,79], avg \u224896. On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (covers several future periods). Observed lead-time evidence (Period 4 conclude) confirms a 2-period arrival; therefore I trust a 2-period lead time. To reflect the clear recent regime shift, I set L via calculation of observed lead times and base demand estimates on the most recent regime: mu_hat and sigma_hat use the last 6 periods (recent_N, N=6) to capture current mean and volatility across the review+lead horizon. This increases service level to avoid stockouts given zero on-hand and substantial recent demand, while avoiding excessive long-term holding since holding cost equals profit. Parameters chosen: L from observed behavior; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N to react to the sustained demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: historical mean (2019-01 samples) \u224813.2 -> recent mean (Periods 4\u20139) =96 (+~627%); sustained for 6 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent sustained demand regime: Periods 4\u20139 show elevated demand (avg \u224896) vs historical Jan mean \u224813.2; confirmed in carry-over. On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (pipeline healthy). Promised lead time is 2 and historical conclude supports LT=2 (Period 5 insight). To reflect the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N=6 for demand mean and volatility (captures the 6-period elevated regime). L left as default (promised 2) because concluded evidence matches promised and only a single confirmed LT observed. These parameters raise base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand while sigma from recent samples captures variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical concluded lead-time evidence confirms 2-period actual lead time (Period 4 message). Demand regime shift (higher mean) has been sustained since Period 4 through Period 12. I keep L as promised (default=2). To capture the new higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand forecast and volatility, using the recent regime from Period 4\u201312 (9 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated demand. This balances service (avoid stockouts given strong in-transit but zero on-hand) against holding cost by forecasting using recent elevated mean and volatility; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand regime confirmed since Period 4: sustained elevated weekly demand (Periods 4\u201313, 10 samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=327 units (pipeline large). Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods; use promised/default. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from most recent regime to capture new demand level while letting OR backend offset pipeline. Using recent_N=10 uses the 10-period elevated regime (Periods 4\u201313) to size base-stock and variability, balancing service vs. holding given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=327 which covers multiple weeks of recent demand (recent weekly demands mostly 32\u2013114). Carry-over confirms lead time=2 and a prior demand regime shift to higher demand; recent 3-week decline (60,40,32) is not yet treated as sustained. Given large in-transit stock and equal profit/holding (q=0.5 \u2192 conservative service level), use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This avoids overreacting to short recent decline while the pipeline absorbs variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical conclude evidence (Period 5) confirmed actual lead time=2; promised LT=2 so use default LT. Demand showed a sustained shift starting Period 4 but has trended down over the last 12 periods (mean \u224875.8). To balance recent downward drift while retaining responsiveness to recent spikes, I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to weight recent weeks more, and estimate sigma from the most recent 12 periods to capture current volatility. This keeps target base-stock responsive to recent demand decline while the large in-transit pipeline reduces urgent ordering.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand (Periods 5\u201316) shows sustained elevated weekly demand vs early 2019: last 12 periods demand sum=824, mean\u224868.7. On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (large pipeline). Prior concluded evidence confirmed lead time=2 (Period 5). To reflect the recent regime while letting OR backend use promised lead time, set L=default (promised 2). Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) periods with recent mean and volatility; this leverages the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit position will reduce actual order quantities computed by the capped policy.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical concluded lead-time evidence: order on P2 arrived P4 \u2192 actual lead time=2. Demand regime shift previously identified (Periods 4\u20139 avg \u224896 sustained). To prioritize service with confirmed higher demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times (use observed avg=2). Set mu_hat using recent_N=6 to target the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 4\u20139). Use sigma_hat recent_N=6 to reflect volatility in that same regime. This ensures base_stock reflects the higher recent demand over the review+lead horizon while aligning uncertainty with recent variability; large in-transit stock reduces immediate ordering pressure but parameters prepare for continuing elevated demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (pipeline large vs recent demand). Historical concluded lead-time evidence confirms L=2. Recent demand has fallen markedly since the April spike; most recent 6 concluded periods (P13\u2013P18) show low, consistent demand (40,32,19,18,15,11) \u2014 regime length=6. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting near-term demand, use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility; keep L=default (promised=2). No overdue/lost shipments beyond known concluded history.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Promised lead time=2 and prior carry-over confirmed LT=2; in-transit stock (327) comfortably covers (1+L)=3 periods of recent demand, so keep promised LT. Recent demand has fallen from the April peak; last sustained low-demand regime spans Periods 12\u201319 (8 samples). Use recent_N=8 to capture the current lower mean and volatility so the OR backend lowers replenishment targets and avoids excess holding cost given Profit=Holding.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. Recent demand shows a sustained regime shift earlier (Periods 4\u20139) but the last 6 periods (P15\u2013P20) are variable with a large spike at P20=156. On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (covers multiple periods). Promised lead time=2 and previously confirmed as 2 (Period 5 evidence). To react to recent variability while keeping pipeline coverage, keep L at default (promised=2). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand level including the P20 spike, and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This balances service (respond to spike) against holding cost given a large in-transit buffer.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile with very large spikes in Periods 20\u201321 (156, 238). On-hand=0, in-transit=327 units (covers some upcoming demand but arrivals not yet visible). Lead-time evidence: multiple concluded messages previously confirm a 2-period actual lead time (Period 5 insight). Demand regime change was detected starting Period 4 and persists; therefore I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new regime. Choices: L set by 'calculate' to use observed lead-time average (captures confirmed L=2). mu_hat set to 'recent_N' with N=18 to use the last 18 demand samples (captures the sustained post-changepoint regime and accounts for recent spikes across many periods). sigma_hat set to 'recent_N' with N=18 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the capped-order logic limit excessive orders given current pipeline.

Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=20) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 20 periods of observed demand; keep L as default (promised lead time=2) since concluded evidence supports it. This biases orders toward meeting the new higher demand while the OR backend will cap orders using its cap formula.

Historical conclude messages confirm lead time=2 (Period 5 insight) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 4 (higher recent demand). To respect confirmed promised lead time and capture the new high-demand regime, I keep L as default (promised=2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime since Period 4; regime length \u224821 periods so N=20 (per rules) to emphasize the recent high demand while smoothing noise. This increases base-stock to service the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. On-hand=0, In-transit=327. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 4 conclude: P2\u2192P4). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 4 and has been sustained; I use the recent regime (Periods 4\u201325) to set demand estimates. Choose L by calculating average observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (regime length 22\u2192cap at 20) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent sustained high-demand regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical data shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 4 (previously recorded). Promised lead time is 2 and was previously confirmed as 2 (no new late/lost arrivals in recent conclude messages). Given the sustained demand regime and long recent history of elevated weekly demand, I set L to default (promised=2) and use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the established high-demand regime (N=20 captures the most recent 20 samples since the changepoint). Profit and holding cost are equal, so service-level target is 50%; recent_N estimates will let the OR backend compute base_stock and the cap while reflecting current volatility and mean, balancing stockouts vs holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 4 (noted previously). On-hand=0, in-transit=327 \u2014 substantial pipeline stock exists. Promised lead time (2) was previously confirmed; no new evidence of lead-time change. To reflect the sustained demand regime while respecting existing pipeline, I use default lead time, and base demand estimates on the most recent data: use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer/high-demand regime without overreacting to short spikes. This balances service (capture elevated mean) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Prior history confirmed actual lead time = 2 (Period 5 insight) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 4 (higher demand). To let the OR engine combine full historical sample information with the promised lead time and current pipeline, I use default lead time and default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps decisions consistent with confirmed L=2 and lets the optimizer cap orders against in-transit inventory to avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 and remains sustained through Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 periods; confirmed historically (Period 5 note) so use default L. For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent regime to capture the elevated mean and volatility; regime length since Period 4 \u2192 use N=20 (capped). This raises base_stock to meet the sustained higher demand while the sizable in-transit inventory limits new ordering risk.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 20 (weekly demands: 156,238,129,111,198,118,138,99,96,83,80). Promised lead time is 2 and previously confirmed as 2 (Period 5 evidence). I set L to default (use promised 2). Demand forecast and volatility should be estimated from the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 20\u201330) to capture current mean/variance. This keeps base_stock aligned to the elevated demand while the large in-transit quantity will be reconciled by the OR engine's pipeline accounting to avoid excessive ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 20: avg demand Periods 20\u201330 = 131.45 (11 samples), sustained for 11 periods.

Observed lead time evidence (Period 4 conclude) supports L\u22482 but only one observed \u2014 use calculated average of observed lead times to remain evidence-based. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (N=11, Periods 20\u201330) so forecast reflects the sustained higher demand; this balances service (avoid stockouts given large demand) while OR backend will cap orders using its cap formula and holding cost tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). On-hand=9, in-transit=327. Historical concluded lead times observed: order on P2 arrived P4 (LT=2) and order on P31 arrived P32 (LT=1) \u2014 mixed evidence but no sustained single new LT; use calculated average LT. Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 20 (Periods 20\u201330 avg \u2248131.45 per carry-over). Use recent demand from that regime to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Chosen methods: L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat=recent_N with N=13 (regime from Periods 20\u201332, N capped to regime length) to reflect higher recent mean across (1+L) periods; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=13 to capture recent volatility.

Demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 20 (avg \u2248131.45 across P20\u2013P30) with recent weeks (P31\u2013P33) still elevated; therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime to capture current higher mean and volatility (N=14 spans P20\u2013P33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand regime is high (Periods 20\u201330 avg \u2248131.45 sustained 11 periods) though Weeks 31\u201334 show mixed signals; on-hand=0, in-transit=367 units \u2014 ample pipeline stock. Historical concluded lead times include both 2-period (Period4) and recent 1-period arrival (Period32), but promised lead time=2 remains reasonable given mixed evidence. I choose L=default to keep the OR engine using the promised lead time (avoids overreacting to a single short arrival). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=11 to anchor to the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 20\u201330) so base-stock reflects the elevated demand; sigma_hat=default to let the engine compute volatility from full history. This combination preserves service level for the high-demand regime while relying on large in-transit inventory to limit new orders and avoid excess holding cost.

Given a large pipeline (on-hand 15 + in-transit 332 = 347) and substantial historical demand history, I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses the full-sample (1+L)-scaled mean and std; this avoids overfitting to short noisy demand swings while the pipeline already provides cover.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=332. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4 from P2), 1 (P32 from P31), 3 (P36 from P33) \u2192 average = 2. Use calculate for L to capture observed variability. Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 20 (carry-over notes): use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focused on the post-change regime. Regime length from Period 20\u201337 = 18 \u2192 N=18 (capped rule). This lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std to reflect the higher sustained demand while L=calculated average ensures pipeline sizing matches observed lead-time variability. Large in-transit (332) means immediate shortages unlikely; parameters focus future orders on sustaining service with moderate safety stock given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=332. Recent concluded lead times show variability (observed 2,1,3 \u2192 average \u22482), so use calculated lead time to reflect observed history. Demand collapsed after Period 33: recent weeks (Periods 31\u201338) show much lower demand than the earlier high regime (P20\u201330). To capture the current low-demand regime I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the most recent 8 samples. This keeps orders aligned with the recent drop while the large in-transit pipeline (332 units) provides coverage during the review+lead window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: avg dropped from 131.45 (P20\u201330) to 25.2 (P34\u201338) (-81%).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent concluded lead-times show variability but average of the last 3 observed (2,1,3) = 2.0 \u2192 use recent_N N=3 for L. Demand regime dropped starting Period 34 and has been low for 6 periods (demands P34\u2013P39 = 22,27,20,29,28,10; mean \u224822.67). Use recent demand window covering this regime (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=332 \u2014 large pipeline will satisfy upcoming demand but variable lead-times warrant using recent observed LT average. These parameter choices bias orders toward the current low-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability to avoid excess holding cost given holding=profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=332. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed 2,1,3); demand regime fell starting Period 34 (recent periods show low weekly demand). To be responsive to the recent low-demand regime I use recent demand samples. L: use recent_N over last 3 observed lead times to reflect recent variability. mu_hat: use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 34\u201340, 7 samples) so (1+L)\xd7recent mean captures reduced demand. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=7 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock from earlier high-demand regime while accounting for recent lead-time variability and the sizable pipeline of 332 units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=332 (large pipeline). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed LT=2 at P4, LT=1 at P32, LT=3 at P36). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability). Demand has sharply declined recently: last 3 concluded demands (P39\u2013P41) = 10, 8, 9; I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 so the OR backend targets safety stock for the current low-demand regime. This also avoids overstock given holding cost equals profit. The large in-transit quantity already covers multiple weeks, so conservative low-demand forecasts reduce additional ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: avg dropped from 25.2 (Periods 34\u201338) to 9.0 (Periods 39\u201341), a -64% decline (P39\u201341: 10,8,9).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has dropped from prior highs: Periods 39\u201341 averaged 9 units (10,8,9) with Period 42 = 33 likely an outlier. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed 2, 1, 3); use recent lead-time average to reflect this variability. On-hand 0 + in-transit 332 provides substantial coverage; using recent demand estimates (N=3) keeps forecasts responsive to the low-current regime and avoids overstock given equal profit and holding costs. Selected L recent_N (N=3) based on last 3 observed lead times [2,1,3]; mu_hat recent_N (N=3) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to base (1+L)-period demand and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 39\u201341) so the OR backend sets a modest base stock and caps order size appropriately.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=332 (large pipeline); recent concluded lead times observed = {2 (P4),1 (P32),3 (P36)} -> average ~2, so set L by calculate to align with observed supplier behavior. Demand regime: sustained drop from earlier highs (carry-over notes) with recent periods P39\u2013P43 showing low demand (10,8,9,33,9). To avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit and recent low demand, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variance on the latest regime. These choices reduce target base-stock to match current low demand while relying on observed lead-time average to time arrivals and prevent adding more inventory unnecessarily.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 332 units (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (examples: 2 at P4, 1 at P32, 3 at P36) so I use the calculated average lead time to reflect this variability. Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 39 (periods 39\u201344 demands = 10,8,9,33,9,13; mean \u224813.67 over last 6). This low-demand regime is sustained though includes an isolated spike at P42. To avoid overstock while covering L+1 periods of near-term demand, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 (captures the current low-demand regime). The large in-transit (332) already provides multi-period coverage; these parameters direct the OR backend to target replenishment appropriate to the current low regime while the pipeline depletes.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=332. Historical lead times have varied (observed 1,2,3) and many shipments appear delayed/lost; to be conservative I set L=explicit=3. Recent demand shows a single large spike at Period 45 (115) amid low recent weeks (9\u201333), so I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 41\u201345: 9,33,9,13,115) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime including the holiday spike while keeping responsiveness. This balances service (capturing spike) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and high holding cost = profit; conservative L prevents under-ordering if shipments are delayed.

Demand shows multiple regime shifts earlier; recent two high demands (P45=115,P46=71) look like short holiday spikes but are not yet a sustained new regime. There is already large pipeline (332) so avoid increasing forecasted demand aggressively to limit holding cost. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and volatility, relying on L=calculated average to scale the review+lead demand. This balances service (acknowledging observed lead-time variability) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.
