Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) mean ~111 units/week; no concluded arrivals observed, on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no evidence of lead-time deviation or demand regime change. Use promised lead time and defaults so OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level vs holding cost given no new signals.

On-hand=0, in-transit=125 (ordered P1) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer lead-time deviations or lost shipments. Promised lead time retained (default). Use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to target high service level given profit/holding (q\u22480.95) while avoiding premature changes based on a single pending shipment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand mean = 111 units (samples: 110,102,105,123,115). On-hand 0, in-transit 257 (matches orders 125+132). No concluded arrivals yet \u2014 insufficient evidence to change promised lead time (possible lead-time \u22652 but not confirmed). Use promised lead time to let OR engine apply its default pipeline treatment and base-stock calculation from full-sample stats. Chosen methods: L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=default (uses (1+L)*mean of all samples = 3*111), sigma_hat=default (uses sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). This balances service level (cover ~3 periods) vs holding cost given moderate holding penalty and current pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=378 (orders from P1\u2013P3) but no arrivals have concluded yet. Promised lead time=2. Historical weekly demand mean=111 (samples provided). No sustained (3+ period) evidence to confirm a lead-time change or demand regime shift. Use default lead time (promised L=2) so backend applies its lead-time model; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts are based on full historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps parameters conservative given uncertain arrivals while letting OR engine cap orders appropriately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1508.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand 50, in-transit 246. History shows one concluded arrival: Period 4 arrival of 132 (order from P2) => observed lead time = 2 (matches promised). Some earlier orders (e.g. P1, P3) have not concluded yet but evidence is not sufficient to declare a lost-shipment regime. Demand samples available are historical weekly values (110,102,105,123,115) and recent weekly demands (P1..P4:130,73,79,82) with no clear sustained shift. I therefore keep promised lead time and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (using observed LT=2) while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise or possibly lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods1-5) = [130,73,79,82,91], recent mean=91.0. On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Period4 conclude shows an order from Period2 arrived with lead_time=2, so actual lead time matches promised. To cover review+lead demand I use L=default (promised=2). I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the up-to-date average demand (1+L multiplied by recent mean) so the base-stock reflects current observed demand rather than older 2019-Jan samples. I set sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (profit >> holding cost) while using recent demand to avoid overreacting to older data and to account for the confirmed lead time and current empty on-hand but large in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order placed Period 2 arrived Period 4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=270. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb 2019) show weekly demands ~102\u2013123 (mean ~111). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6); I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let backend average these. With uncertain but short lead-time evidence, use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat based on (1+L) scaling of historical samples. This keeps forecasts anchored to historical mean while letting the OR engine derive the base-stock and cap given the inferred average lead time, balancing service level (profit high relative to holding cost) against holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=353. Historical weekly demand samples mean=111 (samples: 110,102,105,123,115) but Period 7 saw a large realized demand spike (211) suggesting recent elevated demand; observed concluded lead times = {2,1} (mixed). To balance service vs holding cost I request the backend infer an average observed lead time (method=calculate) so ordering reflects realized shipping behavior, and use default demand and volatility calculations (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples. This leverages the confirmed lead-time evidence while letting the OR engine cap orders per its policy; the large in-transit quantity (353) plus conservative defaults avoids over-ordering despite last-period spike.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=19, in-transit=325. Recent demand volatile with one large spike (211 in Period 7) but typical recent mean ~109. Observed lead times vary {2,1,2,1} -> use averaged lead time. Set L via calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast/volatility on the most recent regime (Periods 4-8) and limit influence of older historical January samples. This balances service (captures recent demand level) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=472 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (observed W = 2,1,2,1 for recent concluded arrivals), average ~1.5 \u2014 so use recent_N to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period behavior. Recent demand shows a short-lived spike (211) but otherwise ~75\u201391; to balance service level vs holding cost I use recent_N=5 for demand and volatility so the OR engine weights the recent spike but smooths it with surrounding periods. These choices keep orders responsive to recent regime while accounting for pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $594.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=185, in-transit=262 \u2014 pipeline ample versus recent weekly demands (historical samples mean ~111/week). Past concludes show actual lead times of 1\u20132 but promised lead time is 2 and earlier carry-over confirmed L=2; no sustained lead-time miss pattern. To keep the OR engine aligned with contractual lead time and the long-run historical demand samples, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (high profit/higher criticality) with modest holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=80, in-transit=262. Recent concluded arrivals show a mix of 1- and 2-period lead times (orders observed arriving with W=2 and W=1), so I use a recent average to capture this variability. I select L via recent_N to reflect the most recent lead-time pattern. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses the full-sample demand mean/variance scaled by (1+L), balancing service level against holding cost given steady historical weekly demand (~110).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent on-hand=24, in-transit=327; historical weekly demand samples (2019-01) average=111 units. Prior concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time ~2 in past evidence. Using promised lead time (default) keeps consistency with observed confirmations. Choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock targeting service given high in-transit inventory and low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history shows variable actual lead times (observed 1 and 2 periods) but enough observations to use the empirical average for lead time; on-hand=0 with in-transit=376 (large pipeline) so avoid overstating demand\u2014use backend defaults for demand stats so OR uses all sample history scaled by (1+L). Choosing calculate for L lets the OR engine infer average observed lead time; default mu_hat/sigma_hat keep demand forecast and volatility tied to all available samples, balancing service level given high pipeline against holding cost (holding low $1/unit). No explicit adjustment for missing shipments since pipeline is large.

Demand history sample mean=111 units/week (provided samples). Given sizable pipeline (328) and uncertainty in lead time, use calculated average lead time so backend aligns ordering horizon; use default demand and volatility scaling to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This balances service (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding explicit overstatement of demand given limited recent evidence of a sustained demand shift.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=388. Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times (1 and 2 periods); no sustained shift beyond the previously recorded confirmation. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed 1/2 variability). Demand shows no sustained regime change (spike at P7 was transient), so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to avoid overreacting to short bursts. This balances service (using calculated L) and holding cost (default mu/sigma prevents overordering despite large pipeline).

Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2) so I let the backend compute the average actual lead time via 'calculate'. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR engine applies full-sample statistics; this balances service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost while accounting for inferred longer-than-promised variability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded lead times center on 2 periods and recent arrivals (P15->P17, P12->P14) used that expectation. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised/default lead time=2, and set demand estimates based on the most recent 5 periods to capture the recent downshift in demand and reduced volatility.

Given mixed signals, use calculated L (average of observed lead times) so backend infers actual lead time from concluded history. Demand history (weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb) is limited but stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the OR engine produce a cap-constrained base-stock that balances $19 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for inferred lead time and current pipeline.

Prior conclude evidence confirms lead time ~2 (carry-over). To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR base-stock targets lower replenishment; keep L as promised (default=2). This balances service (use in-transit buffer) versus holding cost by shrinking forecast to recent demand levels.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent weeks show a sustained collapse in demand versus earlier historical weeks. On-hand=0, in-transit=367 (large pipeline). Use promised lead time (confirmed previously as 2) so OR backend keeps L=2. For demand, detect a sustained low-demand regime from Period 15\u201323 (9 weeks); set mu_hat using recent_N with N=9 to reflect (1+L)\xd7mean of these recent 9 weeks (reduces overstock risk). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=9 to capture recent volatility. These settings steer orders down despite large pipeline, balancing service and holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 15 (2019-05-20): average demand dropped from ~111 (early-sample mean) to 23.0 (Periods 15\u201323), a \u221279% change, sustained for 9 weeks.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 15 (avg \u224823 over P15\u2013P23) per prior carry-over; on-hand=0, in-transit=367 (large pipeline arriving per past orders). I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded history confirms lead time\u22482 and no new evidence of sustained drift. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 15\u201323) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent volatility; this prevents the OR engine from inflating orders based on early high-demand samples and avoids excessive holding cost given the already-large in-transit. Recent_N N=9 matches the detected regime length (9 periods).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Demand has been in the low-regime since Period 15 (avg ~23/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=367 which is ample to cover multiple weeks even with promised L=2. Lead-time evidence in history supports the promised 2-period lead time; no new sustained lead-time change observed. I set L=default to use promised lead time. I forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (use last 11 periods since Period 15 through 25) so mu_hat=recent_N with N=11 and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=11 to capture current mean/volatility; this keeps orders small relative to the large in-transit position and reduces holding cost while maintaining service for the lower demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 15 (avg ~23/week through Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=367 units (ample pipeline). Promised lead time=2 and earlier evidence confirmed lead_time=2; use promised (default) to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to base mu_hat on the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 15\u201326) so the forecast reflects the new lower mean and avoids overstock. Use recent_N (N=12) for sigma_hat to capture volatility in the same recent regime. This keeps orders conservative given low demand and high in-transit, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 15 (2019-05-20) with weekly demand dropping to ~23 (Periods 15\u201327). On-hand=0, in-transit=367 (large pipeline that will cover many weeks). To avoid over-ordering given the low-demand regime and heavy pipeline, use promised lead time (default L=2) and compute demand forecast from the recent low-demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 15\u201327, length=13) so the OR engine\u2019s base_stock and cap reflect the lower mean and observed variability, reducing risk of excess ending inventory while still accounting for pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand shows the low-demand regime identified earlier (post-Period 15): last 5 weeks demand = [10,20,35,32,27], mean \u224824.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=367 (large pipeline). Confirmed lead time historically = 2 periods; use promised/default lead time to align with supplier contract. To capture the sustained low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand from the latest 5 weeks and measures recent volatility; this avoids over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline and low current demand, while default L preserves supplier lead-time assumption.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Promised lead time is 2 and prior conclues confirm lead_time=2; use default L to align with promised lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=15 (Periods 15\u201329) to capture the sustained low-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=15 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders small given large in-transit inventory and reduced demand, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Use lead-time estimate from observed history (calculate) to let backend average realized lead times. For demand forecast multiply review+lead by recent low-demand regime: use recent_N (N=16) covering Periods 15\u201330 to capture the sustained lower mean/variance. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to reflect current volatility. These choices prevent over-ordering by tying mu_hat/sigma_hat to the low-demand regime while L=calculate lets backend reconcile mixed observed lead times.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has stayed in the lower regime since Period 15 (weekly demand ~10\u201350, recent weeks 21\u201350). On-hand=0, in-transit=367 (sizable pipeline). No new confirmed lead-time change (prior confirmed LT=2). I use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine assumption consistent. For demand I use recent_N over the full low-demand regime (Periods 15\u201331) to capture the sustained lower mean/variance; N=17 covers that regime and stabilizes the forecast while letting the OR engine compute base_stock. Sigma uses recent_N over the same window to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the lower, sustained demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 15 (avg ~23 through Period 23) with a more recent upward trend (Periods 24\u201332: 20,35,32,27,21,32,50,60) signaling recovery. On-hand=0, in-transit=367 (large pipeline). Promised lead time = 2 and earlier concludes confirm lead time has behaved as 2. To capture the recent regime while leveraging sufficient sample size, set L to default (promised 2). Use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent 18 weeks (Periods 15\u201332), which reflects the post-changepoint regime and recent rebound; this balances service level against holding cost given the large in-transit stock.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=367. Historical lead-time observations consistently center on 2 periods; recent arrivals align with that. Demand had a sustained drop starting Period 15 (carry-over), but demand has increased in the last 5 weeks (Periods 29\u201333: 21,32,50,60,169) suggesting elevated and more volatile short-term demand. To balance service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but recent spike) and holding cost, I use a calculated lead time based on observed data and recent_N forecasts (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the recent regime while smoothing noise.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Recent demand shows a strong rebound vs. the mid-year low: last 5 realized weekly demands = [32,50,60,169,152] (Periods 30\u201334), mean \u224892.6 and high variance. Prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2 earlier; no new concluded arrivals to contradict promised lead time. I therefore keep L as default (promised=2). To respond to the recent demand spike while controlling holding cost, I set demand estimates using a recent_N window (N=5) to capture the new regime: mu_hat uses the recent mean (scaled by 1+L in backend) and sigma_hat uses recent volatility (sqrt(1+L) scaling in backend). This biases orders toward meeting the recent high demand while limiting sensitivity to older low-demand periods. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime insights to record.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=458 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times confirm promised L=2 previously; recent arrivals consistent enough to use promised lead time. Demand shows a clear recent surge since Period 31 (weeks 31\u201335: 50,60,169,152,137). To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean (~113.6 mean over last 5 \u2192 backend will scale by 1+L). I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect elevated volatility in those weeks. With large in-transit inventory, this avoids immediate extra ordering while the base-stock target is raised to meet the new demand regime and balances profit vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 31 (2019-09-09): avg demand increased from ~23.0 (Periods 15\u201323) to 113.6 (Periods 31\u201335), +393%, sustained for 5 weeks

Recent demand has rebounded (regime starting Period 31; recent weekly demands: Periods 32\u201336 = 60,169,152,137,98) so I base forecast on the most recent 5 weeks. Observed concluded lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2) so I use the calculated average of observed lead times. These settings let the OR backend size base stock to cover the current high-demand regime while the calculated L captures the variable supplier lead time seen in conclusions; recent_N for mu and sigma captures the current elevated mean and volatility to avoid understocking despite holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand regime (starting Period 31) shows elevated weekly demand: periods 31\u201337 = [50,60,169,152,137,98,143] (7 samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=495. No new sustained lead-time change since previous confirmation of L=2; shipments have arrived variably but not enough to override promised lead time. Choose L=default to use promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)-period forecast and volatility), which raises target base-stock to meet service while the capped order limits control per-period inflow and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=408. Recent demand has rebounded (regime starting P31) with high weekly demand (Periods 31\u201338: 50,60,169,152,137,98,143,151). Observed concluded lead times = {five 2s, five 1s} \u2192 average 1.5. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N on demand estimates with N=8 (regime length P31\u2013P38 = 8). This sets L to the empiric average lead time (calculate) so the backend accounts for faster-than-promised arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=8) to size base-stock for the current high-demand regime while controlling inventory holding given holding cost $1 and profit $19.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand regime is the high-demand regime established from Period 31 onward (recent weekly demands ~137,98,143,151,109). On-hand=0, in-transit=450 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary; recent arrivals show lead times [2,2,1,1,3] (avg 1.8). To balance service vs holding cost: set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 5 weeks of demand (captures current high regime). This keeps ordered quantities responsive to the recent high demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits new order size via the OR cap.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=450. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed concluded lead times \u22481.64 so I use calculated average to capture this variability. Demand has clearly shifted up since Period 31 (sustained high weeks); I base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (Periods 31\u201340) to reflect the higher mean and recent variance. These choices (calculate L; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10) bias the base-stock target toward meeting the renewed higher demand while letting the capped ordering limit temper exposure to holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=384. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead-times but overall average close to ~1.7 periods with several recent 1\u20132 period observations and a single 3; I use calculated average lead time to let backend smooth variability. Demand has clearly returned to the higher regime (Periods 31\u201341); I base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current high-demand regime while avoiding older low-demand periods. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the recent upswing while the large in-transit balance (384) limits aggressive additional ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=432. Recent demand has returned to the high regime (Periods 36\u201342: 98,143,151,109,94,94,215) so I use a recent-window forecast to capture current high mean/volatility. Promised lead time remains 2 and recent concluded arrivals are mixed (1\u20133), so I keep L as default (promised=2) to let the backend assume promised lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the most recent high-demand regime (balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$19, holding=$1).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows demand returned to the high regime since Period 31 (weekly demands often >100) and large recent spikes (Period 42=215, P43=82). On-hand=0, in-transit=500 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133 periods); to be robust I let the backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while the backend's base-stock/cap formulas will cap the order against the pipeline. This approach balances service (capture the recovered high-demand regime) against holding cost given the large in-transit position and uncertain individual arrival timing.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=500 \u2014 large pipeline expected to arrive; recent weeks show elevated demand (Periods 40\u201344: 94,94,215,82,53) after the autumn upswing. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime changes beyond prior carry-over insights. Use a short recent window to capture current high demand while relying on promised lead time to let pipeline clear. This balances service (capture holiday/late-year spike) versus holding cost by relying on recent demand for forecast and leaving lead time as default.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=72, in-transit=370. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed values: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,3,2,2,3,2 \u2192 avg 1.8). Pipeline (370) plus on-hand (72) appears ample vs recent high-demand bursts, but lead time variability and occasional 3-period arrivals argue using an empirically estimated lead time. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect realized supplier performance. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat at default so the OR backend uses all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this balances service level (captures demand history and longer effective review+lead horizon) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=35, in-transit=370. Historical concluded lead-times vary (observed 1\u20133 periods) so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times (~1.8). Demand has returned to a higher regime since Period 31; recent weeks (Periods 42\u201346 demands = 215, 82, 53, 59, 37) show a shorter-run mean ~89.2. To capture current demand momentum while reacting to recent volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 observed demands). This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but variable arrivals) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base stock from updated lead-time and recent demand mean/volatility.
