Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) average = 119.4 units/week; no arrivals or prior conclude messages to suggest lead-time drift or lost shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time (2) is plausible; profit/holding ratio is high (q\u22480.95) so target service levels should be aggressive. Use defaults to let OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean/variance: L=promised, mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples), sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (ordered P1) and Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 so P1 order has not yet concluded \u2014 not enough confirmed periods to infer a lead-time change. Historical weekly demand mean = 119.4 (samples: 96,108,122,131,140). Given single missing arrival and no sustained signal, use default (promised) lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7overall-sample-mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7overall-sample-std. This balances service level (covering review+lead demand) while avoiding overreacting to one delayed shipment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand has increased vs. earlier historical samples (recent concluded demands: P1=155, P2=193; earlier weekly series: 96,108,122,131,140). On-hand=0, in-transit=310 (orders from P1/P2 not yet concluded). Orders from Periods 1\u20132 have not arrived by their conclude messages, suggesting actual lead time may exceed the promised 2 or shipments are delayed/lost; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly higher. Choices: L set explicit=3 to protect against ongoing delays; mu_hat set recent_N N=3 to base (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent regime (uses the last 3 demand samples which capture the upward shift); sigma_hat set recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher safety stock to avoid stockouts given missing arrivals, while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excessive holding given the $1/unit/period holding cost and $19 profit margin.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=518 (sum of orders 149+161+208) and no arrivals observed in Periods 1\u20133 conclude. This suggests promised lead time=2 is not being met (multiple overdue shipments). I set L explicit=3 to conservatively allow one extra period for delayed arrivals. Demand history (weekly samples mean=119.4) will be scaled by (1+L) inside the backend, so I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default to let the engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples. This increases order quantities to cover the longer effective pipeline while letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed P1\u2013P3 (149,161,208; total 518) had no arrivals by Period 3 conclude \u2014 3 consecutive periods of overdue shipments, indicating lead-time delays or potential lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3059.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent demand has risen sharply (Period1-4 demands: 155,193,207,257) vs older historical samples (Jan mean ~119). On-hand=0, in-transit=544; P2 order arrival in Period4 shows an observed lead time of 2 for that shipment, while earlier orders remain overdue\u2014risk of lost/delayed shipments. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (captures the confirmed 2-period arrival). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the new, higher-demand regime (N=4 = last 4 periods of demand). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and variance so the OR engine increases base-stock to cover the higher demand while the backend's z* (driven by profit/holding) keeps service-level aggressive but bounded by the cap, mitigating excess holding if some in-transit orders are lost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concludes show one confirmed arrival: Period 4 conclude reports arrival=161 units ordered on Period 2 \u2192 observed lead time = 2 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=730 (large pipeline, several earlier orders were delayed). Demand history (samples from Jan\u2013Feb 2019) has mean ~119.4/week; with confirmed lead time=2 I set lead time method to calculate (backend will compute avg observed lead times). I use default demand and volatility methods so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps the base-stock grounded in full historical average while the OR backend's cap limits ordering given the large existing pipeline, balancing service level (profit/higher fill) against holding cost and the risk of overdue/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: P2 order arrived P4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent demand has risen sharply (Period demands: P1=155, P2=193, P3=207, P4=257, P5=312, P6=236). On-hand=0, in-transit=544 (many units expected but some past orders were delayed). Observed concluded lead times: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P5\u2192P6 = 1; to be robust to mixed evidence use averaged observed lead time (calculate). Demand appears to have a new higher regime in the last 3 periods (P4\u2013P6); set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent high-demand periods. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the elevated demand while using recent samples limits overreaction to isolated spikes; averaging lead times helps hedge between 1 and 2 period observations given prior delays.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Several earlier orders (P1\u2013P3) were overdue but not a new sustained pattern beyond what is recorded. To balance service vs holding cost I use an empirically inferred lead time (average of observed concluded Ls) so the backend computes demand across the correct review+lead window; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so the OR engine uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand has risen and become volatile (recent demands P4\u2013P8 = 257,312,236,211,305) vs earlier low-Jan samples; on-hand=28, in-transit=544 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: P2\u2192P4=2, P5\u2192P6=1, P7\u2192P8=1 \u2014 recent variation suggests shorter recent lead times on average. I set L using recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent lead-time mix (2,1,1). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime (periods 4\u20138) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while using a short recent lead-time estimate to avoid over-ordering given the large pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=881. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (P4: P2\u21922, P6: P5\u21921, P8: P7\u21921) so use calculated average lead time to reflect this observed variability. Demand has clearly increased since the historical Jan samples (recent weekly demands P4\u2013P9 = 257,312,236,211,305,251); I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher mean and volatility rather than older low-Jan samples. These parameters help the OR backend size base stock for (1+L) periods using up-to-date demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces urgent ordering need.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent demand volatile but moderate: last 10 period demands = [155,193,207,257,312,236,211,305,251,184]; on-hand=153, in-transit=562. Several early orders (P1\u2013P3) failed to arrive but more recent arrivals show faster fulfillment. Lead-time evidence (concluded arrivals): P4 showed P2\u2192P4 (LT=2), then P6,P8,P10 show P5\u2192P6, P7\u2192P8, P9\u2192P10 (LT=1 each). I set L via recent_N over the last 4 observed lead times to capture the recent shift toward 1 while retaining the older 2. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 6\u201310) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime after the stockouts/arrivals; same recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices make mu_hat reflect current realized demand levels and shorten effective lead time to avoid overstock from older delayed arrivals, while sigma_hat captures recent variability so the backend's capped ordering balances service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears to have shifted to 1 periods (observed: P5\u2192P6, P7\u2192P8, P9\u2192P10 arrivals \u2014 three consecutive LT=1 observations).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=690. Historical concluded lead-times show a sustained shift to LT=1 (P5\u2192P6, P7\u2192P8, P9\u2192P10). Demand has moved to a higher regime in recent weeks (recent demands: P7\u2013P11 = 211,305,251,184,177; mean \u2248225.6). I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the confirmed LT=1 observations. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime over the last five concluded weeks; this biases the base-stock upward to meet current demand while sigma from recent volatility controls safety stock and holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=828. Recent concluded arrivals show lead time has settled at 1 period (observed: P5\u2192P6, P7\u2192P8, P9\u2192P10). Demand since Period 4 has been in a higher regime (~200\u2013312). I set L using recent_N to reflect the confirmed LT=1 with the last 3 observed lead times. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (regime from P4\u2013P12, 9 samples) so the forecast and volatility reflect the elevated recent demand; this helps the OR backend size base stock to meet the high target service level (profit/total cost implies q\u22480.95) while accounting for observed variability and the shortened lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=725 (large pipeline). Concluded lead-time observations: P2\u2192P4=2, P5\u2192P6=1, P7\u2192P8=1, P9\u2192P10=1, P11\u2192P13=2 (lead times = [2,1,1,1,2]). I use recent_N for L with N=5 to capture the recent mixed LT behavior (avg LT\u22481.4). Demand samples show a rising weekly series (96,108,122,131,140); I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the chosen L, letting the OR engine set safety stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff. This balances service (given some shorter observed L=1 periods) against holding given the large in-transit volume and occasional LT=2 observations.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent realized demand has trended much higher (~200s per week) than the small Jan sample series; on-hand=0, in-transit=629 (pipeline sizable but arrivals are observed with lag). Observed concluded lead times across history: {2,1,1,1,2,2} \u2014 mix of 1 and 2, so use calculate to let backend average observed LT. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent regime rather than the low Jan samples; same recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the backend toward a higher base-stock to meet current ~200+ weekly demand while letting sigma from recent data set appropriate safety stock given lead-time uncertainty and high holding cost sensitivity (profit $19, holding $1).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded arrivals show lead times of [P10:1, P13:2, P14:2] (mix of 1 and 2 with recent tilt toward 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=654 (large pipeline). Demand last 5 concluded periods = [177,211,225,145,82], recent mean lower than earlier peaks but still variable. I choose L as recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent confirmed lead-time observations (avg of last 3 observed LT = 1.667) so the OR engine hedges between 1 and 2. For demand I select recent_N N=5 to capture the latest regime (last 5 weeks) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For sigma I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline uncertainty) against holding cost given high in-transit volume.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent concluded history shows mixed lead times: observed Ls = {2,1,1,1,2,2} (avg=1.5) and multiple overdue/no-arrival orders earlier, with on-hand=0 and in-transit=668. I choose to let backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method 'calculate') to capture the 1.5-period signal. For demand scale and volatility I use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full sample history while the calculated L accounts for recent LT variability and helps the optimizer balance service level vs holding cost given profit $19 and holding $1.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10): on-hand=1, in-transit=705. Recent conclude history shows mixed lead-time observations (both 1 and 2), with no new sustained regime shift; shipments have resumed and pipeline is large. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent mix), and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR engine uses historical sample mean/volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service level given a large pipeline while avoiding overreaction to short-term LT variability.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. Recent history shows mixed but overall shorter-than-promised lead times with some lost/delayed shipments earlier; on-hand=0, in-transit=737. I choose to let the backend infer a robust average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate) and use default demand aggregation and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies the capped base-stock policy using all samples. This balances service (by reflecting observed LT) against holding cost given large in-transit position.

To reflect the recent regime (LT=1) and recent demand pattern, I set lead time by averaging the last 6 observed lead times and use the last 6 demand samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base-stock targeted to recent demand while respecting the large pipeline and cap constraints.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent concluded arrivals show lead time has trended to 1 period in the most recent observations; demand has fallen from spring peaks to ~50\u201375 units/week over the last 5 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=705 (large pipeline). I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent confirmed lead-time regime (favoring LT=1). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the latest low-demand regime (last 5 demand samples: P16\u2013P20). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering risk given large in-transit inventory while maintaining service under the shorter observed lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=705. Recent concludes show mixed but mostly short lead times (observed Ls = 2,1,1,1,2,2,2,1,1 \u2192 avg \u22481.44). Given the confirmed recent variability and the backend's use of average observed lead time, I set L to 'calculate' so the OR engine will infer avg observed LT \u22481.44. I use default demand estimators (mu_hat and sigma_hat = "default") so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances using full historical demand (stable pre-sample seasonality) while letting the backend's cap control order size given the large in-transit volume. This approach addresses possible delayed/lost shipments by letting observed lead times drive L while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to short recent spikes.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=705 (large pipeline but many past delayed/lost arrivals earlier). Recent concluded arrivals show a sustained shorter lead-time (LT\u22481) in recent periods, so I bias L estimate to recent observations. I use recent_N for L with N=3 to capture the most recent lead-time regime. Demand has risen in the last 5 weeks (demands: 72,74,69,88,114); I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to reflect the current demand level over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Volatility likely changed with the recent regime shift, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 as well. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat with recent demand) while using recent LT to avoid over-ordering against stale long-L assumptions.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent concludes show actual lead time has shifted to 1 period for the last three observed arrivals (P5\u2192P6, P7\u2192P8, P9\u2192P10), so I use a recent average for L. Demand has fallen from spring peaks to lower summer weekly demand; last 5 demand observations (Periods 19\u201323: 74, 69, 88, 114, 81) have mean ~85, so I use a recent_N forecast over 5 periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new lower regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=705 \u2014 with L\u22481 the OR should target (1+L) periods of demand; using recent_N keeps the base stock responsive and avoids excess holding given low holding cost but large pipeline. Methods chosen: L recent_N (N=3) to reflect confirmed LT=1 evidence; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture current lower-demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=705 (many prior orders show delayed/irregular arrivals). Historical concluded lead-times show recent sustained LT=1 observations, but there are mixed 1/2 values\u2014so I use recent data to estimate current LT and demand. I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead-times to capture the apparent shift to shorter lead-time behavior. For demand I use recent_N (last 6 weeks) to capture the current lower summer demand (weeks with demands: 69,88,114,81,52,99). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices make mu_hat responsive to the recent downward demand while L reflects the empirically observed shorter lead-times, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given delayed arrivals and low on-hand stock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=705. Recent concluded history (Periods 5\u201315 and 17\u201319) shows multiple confirmed lead-time=1 observations and a sustained shift to LT=1 since Period 11; many large orders earlier remain overdue but LT=1 is the dominant, recent observed lead time. Recent demand (Periods 20\u201326: 69,88,114,81,52,99,137) averages ~89 units/week \u2014 demand regime appears lower than the Jan samples but with variability. To be responsive to the recent regime and the confirmed LT=1, set L explicit=1. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (last 7 demand samples) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility; this focuses ordering on current demand and avoids overstock given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19. These parameters balance service level (use confirmed shorter lead time) against holding cost and address overdue/in-transit uncertainty by relying on recent realized demand rather than older samples.

Historical concluded arrivals show a mix of LT=1 and LT=2 observations; I'll let the backend estimate an empirical average lead time from all observed concludes (method: calculate). Demand sample set is the provided weekly samples (96,108,122,131,140); I'll use default demand and volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat adapt to the chosen L ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (using measured average LT) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and profit/holding ratio.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=705; recent demand has risen (last 5 concluded demands = 99,137,183,187,163; mean=153.8). Historical concluded lead-time observations average ~1.44 (mix of 1s and 2s). To reflect reduced effective lead time versus promised 2, I let backend calculate L from observed lead times. I set mu_hat explicitly to cover (1+L) periods of the recent demand regime (explicit forecast = 153.8 mean \xd7 (1+observed avg LT \u22481.444) \u2248 375.9) so the optimizer orders toward service with current higher demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility from the last 5 realized demands. This balances higher service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) while using recent volatility and inferred shorter LT to avoid excess holding.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent concluded history shows lead time has been observed as 1 period for several consecutive arrivals around Periods 6\u201311; however later periods have many zero arrivals so I conservatively average the most recent confirmed lead times. Demand has risen and become more volatile through summer (several weeks with 150\u2013300+ units). I therefore: (1) set L using recent_N to capture the latest realized lead-time regime (shortened LT), (2) set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 demand observations) to adapt to the recent higher-demand regime, and (3) set sigma_hat using recent_N (last 5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while keeping variability estimates current for the OR backend cap and service-level calculation.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show a sustained shift to 1-period actual lead time (multiple P5\u2192P6, P7\u2192P8, P9\u2192P10 observations). To avoid overstating pipeline delay risk, set L explicit=1. Recent demand has risen sharply in late Aug\u2013early Sep (most recent demands: 183,187,163,300,349); use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from this high-demand regime while relying on pipeline to cover immediate needs.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23. Recent demand has risen sharply (last 5 weekly demands: 187,163,300,349,354 \u2192 mean \u2248270.6), so forecast should use recent data. Lead-time has shown consistent LT=1 in concluded arrivals (multiple recent observations including P31\u2192P32), so I use a recent average lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=705 \u2014 ample coverage vs. (1+L)\xd7recent mean.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Recent demand has jumped sharply starting Period 30 (300, 349, 354, 709 over P30\u2013P33). On-hand=0, in-transit=1069 \u2014 substantial pipeline but recent arrivals show actual lead time has been 1 period in multiple recent observations. I set L to use calculated/recent evidence of observed lead times (use backend's average via 'calculate') to reflect the persistent LT=1 regime. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to focus the forecast on the new high-demand regime (P30\u2013P33). Sigma uses recent_N (N=4) to capture volatility in this new regime. These choices bias orders toward meeting the much higher current demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to avoid excess holding given the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand over P30\u2013P33 = 428 units (300,349,354,709) \u2014 sustained 4-period spike vs prior typical weeks; treat as new high-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 30 (P30\u2013P33 avg \u2248428) and multiple concluded arrivals since P11 indicating actual lead time = 1 for recent orders. On-hand=0, in-transit=1877 \u2014 pipeline large but arrivals delayed/observed with LT=1. I set L via recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time =1. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (P30\u2013P33) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand around the elevated mean and its volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the confirmed higher demand while using observed shorter lead-time to avoid over-ordering against promised LT=2.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=140, in-transit=1447. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 30 (P30\u2013P36 demands: 300,349,354,709,448,375,293) \u2014 higher average vs earlier data. Lead time has been variable recently (mostly LT=1 since P11, but a LT=3 observed for P33\u2192P36), so use a short recent average to capture variability. I set L using recent observed lead times to be responsive to the recent variability (short window). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand samples covering the identified high-demand regime so the backend raises base stock to meet elevated demand while the capped policy limits excessive orders; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) against holding costs.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 30 (P30\u2013P33 avg \u2248428) and mixed observed lead times in the last 3 concluded arrivals (P31\u2192P32=1, P33\u2192P36=3, P35\u2192P36=1). On-hand=0, in-transit=1483 (large pipeline). To capture the recent lead-time variability I set L using recent_N over the last 3 observed lead times (captures the 1/3/1 pattern). For demand I use recent_N over the last 5 demand samples (P33\u2013P37: 709,448,375,293,310) to reflect the new higher-demand regime while smoothing the single 709 spike. Sigma is recent_N over same 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock up to serve the elevated recent demand but rely on large existing in-transit inventory to avoid over-ordering despite occasional longer arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent weeks show elevated demand (Period 30\u201335 spike) and a large pipeline (on-hand=0, in-transit=1727). Historical concludes show variable lead times (mostly 1, some 2 and one 3), so I let the backend compute an average observed lead time. For demand I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale to (1+L) using all available samples, which balances service vs holding cost given the large in-transit position and observed demand variability.

Use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 30; keep demand forecasting to backend default ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility to let OR engine compute base_stock and cap using full sample stats. This balances service level (capture elevated demand) while capping orders via the backend policy given large in-transit stock to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand elevated vs early history (carry-over notes regime shift at P30). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=1724 (large pipeline). Lead times have varied historically (observed 1\u20133); I choose to let backend compute average observed LT to reflect mixed evidence. Demand forecast uses the most recent 5 weeks (P36\u2013P40) to capture current elevated regime while avoiding older low-demand periods. Volatility also uses the same 5-week window. This balances high pipeline (limits immediate ordering) with recent higher demand to avoid understock if some in-transit shipments are lost or delayed.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 30 (weeks with many 300+ demands) and variable observed lead times (mix of 1\u20133 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=1724 \u2014 pipeline is large and should cover near-term demand even if some shipments are delayed. I set L=calculate so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures variability between 1\u20133). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to focus the forecast on the new high-demand regime (most recent 12 weeks cover the spike starting Period 30). For volatility I also use recent_N N=12 so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize service for the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the large in-transit pipeline limit new over-ordering given lead-time uncertainty.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=1724 \u2014 large pipeline that likely covers multiple weeks of elevated demand (recent concluded demands peaked, e.g. P42 demand=999). Historical concluded lead-times are mixed (episodes of LT=1, LT=2, and an isolated LT=3) so no clear, sustained lead-time change to override the promised LT=2. No new sustained demand regime change since the previously recorded spike at P30\u2013P33. I therefore leave L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses the full sample history; with profit/holding implying a high service quantile (q\u22480.95) this will push base-stock high to protect against recent high demand while the large in-transit quantity reduces net replenishment needs. This approach is conservative given overdue shipments in earlier periods but mixed LT evidence now.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent weeks show very high demand (Periods 40\u201343: 288,281,999,922) and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=1724 \u2014 pipeline is large but many past shipments showed irregular/late arrivals (multiple overdue stretches and mixed LT observations including LT=3). I set L to "calculate" so backend averages all observed concluded lead times (captures observed variability including occasional 3-period delays). For demand and volatility I use "default" (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set) so the OR engine derives base_stock and cap from the full historical demand while accounting for the inferred average lead time. This balances high recent demand against holding cost given high profit margin (q\u22480.95) and leverages the large in-transit quantity rather than further aggressive manual up-weighting.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=1724. History shows variable actual lead times (observed LT samples include 1,2,3) with recent mix; several earlier periods had prolonged overdue shipments but later periods produced multiple LT=1 observations. To capture the true average lead time I set L using 'calculate' (average of observed lead times). Demand mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, letting the OR engine calibrate base-stock and cap given the inferred average lead time and all historical demand data. This balances service (by adjusting L from promised) against holding cost using full-sample demand estimates.

Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 30 (P30\u2013P33 avg ~428) and volatile arrivals with some delayed shipments earlier; however no new confirmed, sustained lead-time change beyond prior notes. I select L=default (promised 2) to keep model aligned with supplier promise while the OR engine lacks lost-shipment awareness. For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (covering Periods 30\u201345) to capture the post-changepoint higher mean (backend will compute (1+L)*mean over these recent samples). Sigma is recent_N N=16 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained elevated demand while capping risk via the OR engine's cap and using the promised lead time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=1966. History shows varied actual lead times (1\u20133) with many overdue/no-arrival periods but several concluded LT observations; use calculated average LT to capture that empirical mix. Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime beginning Period 30 and persisting through recent weeks (many large weekly demands Nov\u2013Dec). To reflect the sustained regime, use recent_N for demand forecast and volatility with N=17 (covers the regime from Period 30 through Period 46). These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances high seasonal demand against holding cost while the calculated L accounts for the observed lead-time variability and overdue arrivals.
