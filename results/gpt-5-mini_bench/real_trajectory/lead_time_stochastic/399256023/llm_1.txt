No major calendar events in mid-February that would explain a one-week spike (Valentine's is nearby but not a clear driver for basic denim). Promised lead time = 2 periods; with no on-hand or in-transit inventory, order must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after ordering). Given the strong recent single-week spike and high unit profit ($19) relative to holding cost ($1/period), I bias toward meeting higher demand to avoid lost sales. Forecasting conservatively at ~100 units/week (elevated from prior baseline due to recent spike) -> need ~300 units to cover 3 periods. Place order of 300 units.",

Holding cost is low ($1) but profit per unit is high ($19); however excess inventory already in pipeline risks large holding cost over many periods. e) Order logic: given ample pipeline relative to forecasted demand and uncertain/variable lead time with history of lost shipments, avoid adding more risk by not ordering this period. Recommendation: order 0 units.",

{
  "rationale": "Date: 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, no immediate holiday spike). Product: ladies denim ankle jeans \u2014 modest, steady weekly demand. Recent observed demand (Periods 40\u201346): [31,33,60,40,32,35,30] \u2192 recent weekly average \u2248 36. Required coverage = (promised lead time 2 + 1) = 3 periods \u2192 3 * 36 \u2248 108 units. Inventory assessment: on-hand = 127, in-transit = 1020. Historical lead-time evidence is mixed (observed arrivals with 1\u20133 period lags and some lost shipments), but current pipeline + on-hand (127 + 1020 = 1147) far exceeds the 3-period demand requirement. Given high pipeline and ongoing holding cost ($1/unit/period), placing additional order would only increase holding cost risk. Therefore place no order this period.",
