Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 720504001 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrival history available to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time and historical samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) as baseline. To balance service vs holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this keeps parameters anchored to historical demand until we observe concluded arrivals or sustained demand shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent history: Period1 order of 55 has not arrived (arrived=0) but there is no concluded arrival record indicating an actual lead-time change. Use promised lead time. Historical demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean=34.8/week; with promised L=2 I'll use default demand aggregation to cover review+lead (1+L)=3 periods. Using defaults keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to full-sample stats while avoiding overreacting to a single missed arrival. On-hand=0 + in-transit=55 noted; defaults will let OR cap/order calculation account for pipeline inventory.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=113 (matches orders 55+58). Two consecutive concludes show arrived=0 but promised L=2, and no concluded arrivals yet is expected until Period (order_period+2) conclude; no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipments (only 2 periods of non-arrival). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean=34.8. I therefore keep L at the promised default and use default demand estimates: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all_samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples to let the OR backend compute base stock and cap using full-sample statistics. This is conservative given limited evidence of lead-time or demand regime shifts and keeps service focus while avoiding premature inventory inflation.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed demand (Periods 1-3 concludes) = 49, 54, 35, which is ~32% above the older 5-sample historical mean (34.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=138 but no concluded arrivals yet (orders in P1-P3 show arrived=0). I use default L (promised 2) because no concluded arrival messages have established a different actual lead time. For demand I detect a recent upward regime in the last 3 concluded periods, so I set mu_hat via recent_N (N=3) to capture the higher short-term mean (avg=46) and let the backend scale by (1+L). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect current variability. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the 3-period review+lead window under the recent higher demand while keeping sigma responsive to recent variance; using recent data helps avoid under-ordering given current elevated demand and the apparent shipment issues.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (ordered=55,58,25) have not concluded (arrived=0) over 3 consecutive periods; suspect delayed or lost shipments affecting lead-time reliability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). On-hand=34, in-transit=95 which matches outstanding orders P1=55, P3=25, P4=15 (P2=58 already arrived in P4). Historical demand samples mean=34.8/week (33,41,28,20,52). One observed lead-time: P2 ordered in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 => lead_time=2. Given confirmed lead_time=2 and no sustained demand regime shift, use average lead time (calculate) and default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies its base-stock formula consistently while accounting for the confirmed L=2.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (ordered on Period 2 arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=12, in-transit=97. Historical weekly demands show a recent downshift: Periods 3-5 demands = 35,24,22 (declining from earlier high values). One confirmed lead-time observation: order on P2 arrived P4 => lead_time=2. Earlier missing arrivals (P1-P3 orders) noted but not yet re-confirmed as a persistent new lead-time. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead-time evidence. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to adapt to the recent lower-demand regime (captures most recent 3 demand observations), and set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the demand drop while accounting for observed lead time reliability, reducing excess holding costs given holding/profit tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=95. Recent observed lead times vary (1 and 2), and several early orders appear lost/delayed; demand has dropped starting Period 4. I set L using observed lead times average to let backend account for variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=3: Periods 4-6) because a sustained lower-demand regime (3 periods) is evident; sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering given the lower recent demand while accounting for lead-time uncertainty and remaining in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg demand before P4 (P1-P3)=46.0, avg demand P4-P6=26.7 (-42%); sustained for 3 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has shifted down: P4-P6 average demand = 26.7 vs P1-P3 = 46.0 (sustained for 3 periods). Current inventory: on-hand 0, in-transit 95 (some earlier orders missing but recent concludes show lead times of 2 and 1). To balance service and holding cost, set lead time to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures variability between 2 and 1). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecasts on the confirmed lower-demand regime (P4-P6), keeping N=3 because regime length is 3 periods. This tight recent-based forecast reduces overstock risk given holding cost $1 and profit $4.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand regime is lower: P4-P6 avg=26.7 (confirmed); recent weeks P7-P8 spiked to 30 and 55 but no on-hand stock to satisfy them. On-hand=0, in-transit=95 (likely includes earlier outstanding orders and one confirmed arrival pattern). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2192 average ~1.5. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (P4-P6) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. With in-transit=95 and (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u2248 (1+1.5)*26.7\u224866.8, pipeline likely sufficient so OR cap will bind; these settings reduce overstock risk while preserving service for the new lower-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): on-hand=0, in-transit=139. Historical concluded lead-times show mixed evidence but promised lead time=2 and prior carry-over confirmed a 2-period arrival (P2\u2192P4); some earlier orders were delayed/lost but recent arrivals occurred. Demand has shifted down earlier (P4-P6 lower) but recent 5-demand sample (P5-P9 = 22,34,30,55,22; mean=32.6) is most representative now. I keep L as default (promised=2) to align with confirmed evidence and OR assumptions, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the latest demand regime, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. Large in-transit (139) will be accounted for by the backend pipeline term.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent history shows variable lead-times (observed 2,1,1) and earlier missing arrivals; on-hand=5, in-transit=95 so pipeline is large but arrivals have been inconsistent. I keep L as promised (default) to let OR use contract lead time while acknowledging mixed evidence. Demand appears to have shifted downward around Period 4 and recent weeks are volatile; I use a recent_N mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures latest regime/volatility). I keep sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes dispersion from full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices bias orders toward recent demand while relying on promised lead time in case of mixed arrival evidence and avoid overreacting to single late shipments.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {P4:2 (ordered P2), P6:1 (ordered P5), P10:1 (ordered P9)} \u2192 average observed lead time \u2248 1.33. On-hand=0, in-transit=121; there have been intermittent delays but enough concluded samples to prefer an empirical average. Use L='calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time. Demand shows earlier regime shift at P4 but subsequent periods are mixed; to avoid overfitting to a short recent burst, use default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service level vs. holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1 and the uncertain but mostly ~1\u20132 period lead times.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=127. Historical concluded lead times observed = {P4:2 (order P2->P4), P6:1 (P5->P6), P10:1 (P9->P10)} (avg ~1.33). Demand history shows an earlier sustained drop around P4-P6 but subsequent periods regained higher volumes, so no new persistent demand regime. To balance service vs holding cost, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures mixed evidence of 1\u20132 period actual lead time). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use full-sample statistics scaled by 1+L) because recent demand does not show a new sustained shift warranting a recent_N or EWMA change.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent history shows variable actual lead times observed in concluded messages: 2,1,1,2 (avg 1.5). Demand recent 5 periods (P9-P13) = [22,39,45,31,24], mean ~32.2 which reflects the post-changepoint lower regime with intermittent spikes. On-hand=2, in-transit=101. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so OR uses empirical average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent regime and dampen older higher-demand samples. This balances service (capture recent spikes) vs holding cost by not over-weighting early high-demand periods or transient spikes.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=103. History shows variable actual lead times observed in conclude messages: 2,1,1,2,2 (avg 1.6) and earlier missing arrivals (Periods1-3) indicate shipment reliability issues. Demand has been variable; recent periods (P10\u2013P14 demands = 39,45,31,24,51) show a modestly higher recent mean (~38) versus the older Jan samples. To balance service level vs holding cost: set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to capture realized variability (better than blindly using promised 2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent demand regime while avoiding older regime noise. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent volatility. This approach helps the OR backend produce orders that account for recently observed lead-time behavior, current pipeline, and recent demand patterns while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Demand has shown a downshift since Period 4; to be responsive to the post-change regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 6 demand samples (Periods 10-15) so the OR engine targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=130. History shows earlier missing arrivals (P1-P3) but several concluded lead times recently: observed lead times = {2,1,1,2,2} (avg 1.6) so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand has rebounded since the low regime at P4-P6; last 8 demand samples (P9-P16 = 22,39,45,31,24,51,36,48) show mean ~34.5, so I use recent_N N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime. These settings let the OR engine size the (1+L)-period forecast from recent demand while using observed lead-time evidence to adjust L; with profit $4 and holding $1 this balances service level vs holding cost given pipeline=130 may already cover some lead-time demand.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=103. Observed lead times (from concluded arrivals) = [2,1,1,2,2,2] (avg ~1.67) with majority =2; promised=2. Recent demand (last 6 concluded periods P12-P17) = [31,24,51,36,48,53], mean=40.5. Given mixed but majority lead-time=2 and recent demand increase vs earlier low regime, I set L by calculating the average observed lead time to let the OR backend blend historical variations. For demand I use a recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand level and volatility; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent variability. These choices keep stock targets responsive to the recent uptick while accounting for lead-time uncertainty and avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Current on-hand=0, in-transit=139 (large pipeline). Use calculate for L to reflect observed average lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging the larger pipeline to avoid over-ordering while keeping service via the inferred slightly >1 lead time.

History shows mixed but mostly 2-period arrivals with occasional 1-period; recent 5 observed lead times average ~1.6 so use recent_N=5 to capture recent behavior. Demand had a drop around Period 4 sustained for 3 periods, but recent demand (last 5 weeks: P15-P19) averages ~40.2 units \u2014 use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current regime and recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:

Recent realized demand (Periods 15-20) averages ~35.7 units/week; use a recent window to capture the current regime. Using promised lead time keeps alignment with supplier contract while recent_N demand/volatility captures the lowered regime and recent variability. In-transit (128) plus order decisions should cover (1+L) periods of demand; parameters chosen to focus the OR backend on current realized demand levels and avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Historical concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2,2,2,1} (avg ~1.57) showing occasional 1\u20132 period reality but overall ~1.6; several past missing arrivals noted but later concluded, so use observed-average lead time. Demand has a sustained lower regime since Period 4 (noted earlier); no new sustained changepoint detected. Choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed-average lead time; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history, balancing service level against holding cost given current in-transit coverage.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,1,2,2,1,2), and earlier periods revealed a sustained demand regime shift downward starting Period 4 (already recorded). To account for variable actual lead time I set L to the average of observed lead times. For demand I focus on the recent post-changepoint regime (use most recent data) to avoid overstating demand; therefore mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with a large recent window to capture the new regime while remaining robust to noise. These choices bias orders toward meeting current lower demand while reflecting lead-time variability so the OR backend balances service level versus holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=116. Historical concluded lead times vary (mix of 1s and 2s); demand experienced a sustained downward shift starting Period 4 (P4-P6 avg ~26.7 vs P1-P3 avg 46.0). To reflect actual lead-time variability use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. For demand parameters, use recent data from the post-change regime to avoid upward bias from early high-demand periods: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent 20 demand samples (covers the sustained lower-demand regime). Use matching recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices give the OR backend a lead-time estimate grounded in observations and demand moments focused on the newer, lower-demand regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 4 (confirmed earlier) and mixed observed lead times (observed = [2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2], avg \u22481.625). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=118 \u2014 significant pipeline but visibility lag means some earlier orders were delayed/lost; maintain conservative demand estimate based on the post-change regime. Set L using calculated average of observed lead times so the OR engine accounts for empirical lead-time behavior. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent stable lower-demand regime (caps N at 20) so orders reflect the current lower mean and variance and avoid overstocking. This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost by shrinking demand forecast to the new regime while the backend computes safety stock.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W: 2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,3; avg\u22481.78) so I use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead times. Recent demands (most recent 9 periods) better reflect current regime after the earlier drop around P4 and subsequent recovery; therefore I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=9 so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This balances service (using recent higher demand observations) against holding cost while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit position.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent history: on-hand=0, in-transit=105. Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) = [2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,3,2] \u2192 mean ~1.8. Demand has historically shifted down around Period 4 and has been variable since. There are past missing arrivals earlier but most recent concludes show deliveries with lead times 1\u20133. I set L by 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average lead time (captures observed variability ~1.8). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, providing a conservative pooled forecast that balances service (covers (L+1) periods) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio. This avoids over-reacting to short-lived spikes (e.g., isolated lead-time=3) while using full-sample demand stability after the Period-4 regime shift.

Historical concluded lead-times show variability (observed LT samples mean \u22481.8 periods) so use calculate to let backend set L based on observed LT history. Recent demand (last 5 concluded demands: Periods 24-28 = 39,28,38,40,49; mean \u224838.8) better reflects current regime than older samples, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture current mean and volatility over the review+lead horizon. This balances service (capture recent elevated demand) vs holding cost by basing forecast on the most recent regime while letting OR backend compute safety stock from profit/holding ratio.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=128; there have been multiple varied observed lead times (1\u20133) and some delayed/lost arrivals earlier. I select L=recent_N (N=5) to bias lead-time estimate toward the most recent arrivals (recent average \u22482 periods) to protect against ongoing delays. Demand has varied but recent weeks show mid-to-high 30s\u201340s demand; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime and recent volatility so the OR backend computes a base-stock tuned to recent demand and measured variability. These choices balance service (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) vs holding cost by relying on recent evidence rather than long-ago samples.

Recent demand shows higher volatility with a large spike in Period 30; to capture current demand regime while smoothing noise, use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures Periods 26-30). These settings balance service (capture recent uptick) against holding cost given limited on-hand and substantial in-transit inventory.

Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133), average close to the promised 2. Demand history shows earlier sustained drop (P4\u2013P6) but no new 3+ period sustained regime change recently; recent spikes at P30\u2013P31 are short (2 periods) and not yet a confirmed regime. To be conservative and let the OR engine balance service vs. holding cost, use calculated average lead time from observed concludes, and default demand/volatility computed from full sample set (no explicit override).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=4, in-transit=112 (pipeline=116) vs recent demand spike weeks (P30-P32). Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20133; recent average skewed slightly above promised 2. To balance service vs holding cost I set lead time estimate using recent observed LT (captures recent 1\u20133 variability). Demand forecast uses recent demand (last 6 weeks) to capture the recent surge; volatility also from last 6 weeks to reflect higher variance.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand spike at Periods 30-32: avg demand P30-P32=87.0 vs prior 6-period avg (~38.5), +126% (sustained 3 periods).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent history shows a pronounced demand spike starting Period 30 (P30-P33: 90,101,70,151) while lead-times have varied 1\u20133 but recent arrivals (P32,P30,P27,P26,P22,P19) average ~1.83. On-hand=0, in-transit=221 (large pipeline). To capture the recent high-demand regime I use a short recent window for demand (N=4) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the spike; for lead time I average the last 6 observed lead times to smooth transient 1/3 outliers while acknowledging variability. These settings help the OR backend raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while the L estimate guards against lost/delayed shipments by increasing the covered review+lead horizon.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand shows a sustained spike around Periods 30-33 (Period33 demand=151, P31=101, P32=70, P30=90) \u2014 recent 3-period average is much higher than the long-run mean. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=360. Lead-time history is noisy (1\u20133) but promised L=2 and recent confirms often 1\u20132; use default promised lead time to avoid overcorrecting for intermittent delays. Set demand forecast to focus on the recent high-demand regime using recent_N N=3 so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current spike; this prevents underordering despite a large pipeline. These choices balance service level (capture spike) vs holding cost (pipeline already large).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=375 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times (12 observations) average ~1.75 periods; recent demand shows a clear, sustained spike starting Period 30. I set L using calculate to let backend use the observed-average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 30-35) to capture the new high-demand regime (reduces stockouts). Sigma also recent_N N=6 to reflect volatility in the spike. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the confirmed high-demand regime while the backend\u2019s cap prevents excessive single-period ordering given pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent sustained demand spike from Periods 30-35 (6 periods) \u2014 higher mean vs prior regime \u2014 so forecast should use recent regime. On-hand=46, in-transit=251 (pipeline ample), but historical arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133 periods) and some missing shipments earlier, so infer lead time from concluded history rather than promised. Set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime and its volatility. This raises base stock to improve service during the confirmed spike while pipeline inventory limits excess ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=289. Recent sustained demand spike from Periods 30-35 (avg ~99.8) persists through Period 37 (high sales: P37 demand=111). Pipeline (289) is large but arrival timings remain noisy; historical lead times vary (1-3). To prioritize service during this confirmed high-demand regime while letting OR cap limit over-ordering, keep promised lead time (default) and use recent demand (last 6 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets a base-stock appropriate to the new high mean and its volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand remains elevated (multiple weeks of 70-151 demand; P30-P38 shows sustained spike). On-hand=0, in-transit=303 \u2014 substantial pipeline but past shipments showed variable lead times including 1\u20133 periods and some delayed/lost earlier; use observed lead-time average rather than promised. Set L=calculate to let backend use average observed lead times. For demand, focus on the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (captures the sustained spike from ~P31\u2013P38) so OR base-stock targets the elevated demand while sigma reflects recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during spike) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=339. Recent history shows a sustained demand spike from Periods 30-36 (high weekly demand ~90-110) so I bias forecasts to recent periods. Lead times have been variable (1-3) recently; I use a short recent average to reflect current supplier behavior while keeping responsiveness. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent demand (last 6 weeks covering the spike) so OR backend raises base stock to meet elevated demand; sigma_hat uses same window to reflect increased volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent history shows a sustained demand spike starting around Periods 30-35 (confirmed through Period 36) and elevated demand continues through Periods 37-40 (recent demands: 111,109,69,79). Lead times have varied (observed 1\u20133 periods, with occasional delays/losses). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures variable recent behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the confirmed spike regime (6-period sustained increase) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 6 demand samples. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility in the spike regime. These choices bias orders upward to cover the sustained higher demand while using observed lead-time averaging to moderate over-ordering given variable arrivals.

On-hand=0, in-transit=303 (large pipeline). Observed lead times vary (1\u20133), average \u22481.75; use calculated average lead time. Use recent 6-period demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher demand and keep service while avoiding excess long-term holding given holding cost=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): on-hand=0, in-transit=303. Recent history shows volatile actual lead times (1\u20133 periods) and a sustained demand spike since Period 30; last 6 demands (P37\u2013P42) average ~100 units/week. Given large in-transit but unreliable arrivals, I use a recent-window estimate for lead time to capture current variability, and recent-window demand/volatility (N=6) to reflect the elevated demand regime. These choices raise the backend base-stock to protect service level during the demand spike and mitigate lost/delayed shipments while controlling holding cost by using a focused recent sample rather than all-time average.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent demand remains elevated vs earlier baseline: last 6 demands (P38-P43) = [109,69,79,90,142,43], indicating a sustained high/volatile regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=339 (pipeline large). Observed concluded lead times (16 samples) average \u22481.75 periods; use calculated average to reflect empirical lead-time mixture (1\u20133). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the current high mean and volatility over the most recent sustained spike. These params prioritize service during elevated demand while backend cap limits will curb excess ordering given large pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Recent history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods) with an average ~1.75 and prior evidence of delayed/lost shipments; on-hand=0, in-transit=339 (large pipeline). Demand elevated since Period 30 with sustained high levels through Periods 30\u201344. To balance service vs holding cost: infer lead time from observed arrivals (use calculate to average observed lead times), use an EWMA demand forecast to emphasize recent high demand (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat, and keep sigma_hat as default to reflect overall observed variability. This configuration directs the OR backend to target a higher base stock reflecting recent demand while letting the backend account for promised lead time and pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=303 \u2014 large pipeline which likely covers upcoming demand. Historical concluded lead times vary (mix of 1\u20133 periods) so I use calculated average lead time from observed conclusions. Demand has been elevated recently (Periods 40\u201345 mean \u224890 units/week); to capture the current regime I set demand forecast using the most recent 6 periods for both mean and volatility. These choices (L=calculate, mu_hat recent_N=6, sigma_hat recent_N=6) let the OR backend compute a base-stock that reflects measured lead-time behavior while using the recent high-demand regime to avoid stockouts, and the recent volatility to temper the safety stock given the already-large in-transit position.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=320. Observed historical lead times vary (1\u20133 periods) with average ~1.8; earlier missing arrivals occurred but subsequent concludes show variability. Demand experienced a sustained spike around Periods 30\u201335 (already recorded). To capture true lead-time variability I set L to 'calculate' (use average observed lead time). Given no recent clear new demand regime change beyond the recorded spike, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend uses all samples scaled by 1+L) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost using observed overall demand and computed L.
