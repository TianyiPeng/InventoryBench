Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly samples (5): mean=92.4, no concluded arrivals observed yet (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Promised lead time is 2 and there is no evidence to override it. Use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given profit=4 vs holding=1 with no detected regime or lead-time shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent historical weekly demand average = 92.4 units (samples: 97,69,105,87,104). On-hand=0, in-transit=117 (order placed Period 1 not yet concluded; cannot infer actual lead time). Promised lead time = 2. No sustained changepoint or evidence of lost shipment yet (only one missed arrival). Use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on full sample set; this balances service level given moderate demand and modest holding cost (profit/ (profit+holding)=4/(4+1)=0.8 implies relatively high target fill rate).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=232 (orders from P1 and P2 not yet concluded). Promised lead time is 2; we have no concluded arrivals that contradict it, and two consecutive zero-arrival concludes could be normal given lead time timing (arrivals from P1 expected to conclude in Period 3). No sustained signal of lead-time change or demand regime shift in the 5 historical weekly samples (mean ~92.4). To avoid premature adjustments, use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This balances service level (covering review+lead demand) without overreacting to potentially delayed but not-yet-confirmed shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=316 (orders placed P1:117, P2:115, P3:84). No arrivals have concluded for P1\u2013P3 orders; shipments are overdue but not yet confirmed lost. Use promised lead time (default) because concluded messages are required to infer actual lead time. Demand history (five weekly samples from Jan 2019) will be used globally, so select default mu_hat and sigma_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps the OR engine anchored to historical demand while waiting for arrival/lead-time confirmation, balancing service level vs holding cost under current uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Delayed shipments: orders placed P1-P3 totaling 316 units (117+115+84) have not concluded by Period 3; monitor for lost shipment evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $345.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Current on-hand=23, in-transit=204. One concluded arrival shows actual lead_time=2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). Orders from Periods 1 and 3 remain unconcluded (may be delayed/lost) but evidence is not yet a confirmed change to lead time. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures the confirmed 2-period observation). For demand I use mu_hat=default (uses all historical samples; (1+L)\xd7mean provides coverage over review+lead period). For sigma_hat use default to reflect historical variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service level (covering (1+L) periods) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio, while leaving lead-time inference to the backend's calculated average from observed conclusions.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows one confirmed arrival: Period 4 concluded arrival of the order placed in Period 2 with lead_time=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=293 (includes outstanding orders from P1 and P3 that remain unconcluded). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (observed = 2) rather than the promised value; this anchors the review+lead period to confirmed behavior. Demand history samples (2019-01 weekly series) still form the baseline, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) to let the OR engine compute base_stock and the capped order. This balances service (using confirmed lead time) against holding cost while acknowledging overdue shipments in the pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order placed Period 2 arrived Period 4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand samples (historic weekly: 97,69,105,87,104) show moderate, stable weekly demand (~92 mean). Current inventory: on-hand=3, in-transit=222. Some earlier orders experienced delays (P1-P3 partially unresolved), but arrivals in P4 and P6 confirm lead times of 2 and 1; evidence is mixed so use observed-average. I set L=calculate to let backend use average of observed lead times (uses concluded messages only). For demand parameters I choose default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (via base-stock) against holding cost given profit=4, holding=1. The large in-transit (222) plus low on-hand argues against aggressive extra ordering now; defaults with calculated L will let the OR engine cap orders appropriately.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized weekly demand has averaged ~97 units (periods 1-7 total demand 676 /7=96.6). On-hand is 0 and in-transit=304 units (covers multiple future periods). Historical conclude messages show mixed arrival timing but no sustained demand regime shift; one confirmed LT=2 observation exists. To avoid overfitting to noisy arrival variability and because demand appears steady around ~97/wk, I use the default promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level against holding cost given current pipeline coverage and the absence of a sustained change in demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand history (P4\u2013P8 sales: 92,82,86,103,108) centers near historical mean (~92). On-hand=0, in-transit=209 \u2014 pipeline appears sufficient but previous periods showed delayed/lost shipments so infer lead time from concluded arrivals. Observed concluded lead times (most recent 4): 2,1,2,1 \u2192 use recent_N (N=4) for L to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period behavior. Forecast mu_hat using recent demand to adapt to current regime; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the latest weekly demand average across the review+lead horizon. Keep sigma_hat as default (uses all samples) to provide stable volatility estimate. These choices balance service (short lead spikes) against holding cost by sizing base stock to recent demand while acknowledging variable lead times and existing in-transit stock.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=307. Historical concluded lead times show variability of 1 and 2 periods (observed W sequence [2,1,2,1]); recent variability motivates using a recent average. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P5\u2013P9 demands = 82,86,103,108,67) reflects current regime better than the older Jan samples. To balance service (profit $4) vs holding ($1) and to cover review+lead demand, I set L using the recent 4 observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (N=5) so the OR backend will compute a base-stock tuned to the latest demand and lead-time behavior while avoiding overreacting to older data or single delayed shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods across recent arrivals), average ~1.5 \u2014 use calculated average to reflect this variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service (captures average demand over review+lead) against holding cost given modest holding relative to profit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent weekly demand samples average ~94 (historic samples: 97,69,105,87,104; later weeks show similar variability and several weeks of demand ~66-117). On-hand=0, in-transit=266 \u2014 pipeline covers multiple weeks but past deliveries show mixed actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the 1\u20132 variability). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1. This approach is robust to mixed lead-time observations and leverages full sample history while the pipeline (266) already provides substantial cover.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times of 1 and 2 periods (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=308 (large pipeline); some earlier orders were delayed but subsequent concludes indicate shipments do arrive with variable 1\u20132 period lead times. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the 1/2 mix). Demand history (samples mean \u224892.4) is limited and shows no sustained regime shift, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to produce a balanced base-stock that respects observed variability and the mixed lead time while avoiding overreacting to recent noise.

Use L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history. Demand shows no sustained regime change vs. sample history, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level needs (covering review+lead demand) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has been intermittent but centered ~80\u2013110/week (historical samples provided). On-hand=0, in-transit=260 \u2014 several earlier orders were delayed; continue to monitor for lost shipments. Observed actual lead times fluctuate between 1\u20132 periods; I select L='calculate' to have the backend use the empirical average lead time from concluded messages. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all historical samples; this keeps the forecast robust to noise while letting the OR engine adjust base-stock for the inferred average lead time, balancing service level (profit/holding tradeoff) against holding costs given potential lost/delayed shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand has been volatile with a large spike in Period 15 (179). On-hand=0, in-transit=301 (covers multiple expected arrivals but arrivals visible only in future concludes). Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 2-period arrivals (several P\u2192P+2 confirms) so using promised/default lead time (2) is consistent. Given limited sample set and no clear sustained demand regime shift, use default demand/volatility estimates based on all samples to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap. This balances service level (captures typical demand mean) against holding cost, while leaving in-transit inventory to cover short-term spikes.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=326 (sufficient pipeline but recent high demands in P15-16 are not yet a sustained regime). Observed concluded lead times (most recent: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2) average ~1.625 -> use recent_N to capture recent behavior. Demand historical samples (97,69,105,87,104) used for demand forecast; use recent_N to tie mu_hat to those recent samples. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale variability with chosen L. These choices balance service level (capture slightly >1.5 periods lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has spiked: Periods 15-17 demands = 179, 182, 149 (avg 170), well above historical ~80-90. On-hand=0, in-transit=340 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals have exhibited mixed lead times (1\u20132 periods). Observed lead times (from concluded arrivals): [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1] avg=1.6. I treat lead time empirically (use calculate) and update demand forecast using the recent 3-period high-demand regime to capture the spike. sigma_hat uses the same recent_N=3 to reflect increased short-term volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to raise the base stock for the higher demand regime while acknowledging mixed lead-time evidence and substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 15: avg demand increased from ~86 (prior history) to 170 over Periods 15-17 (+98%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand regime (Periods 15-17) roughly doubled vs. historical; last 5 demands (Periods 14-18) average ~142.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=537 (ample pipeline but some past delayed shipments noted). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (mixture of 1\u20132 period realizations). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across the latest 5 periods. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias targets upward to avoid stockouts during the confirmed higher-demand regime while allowing the OR engine to cap orders given pipeline inventory and holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 15 (avg ~170 over P15-P17) and mixed lead-times of 1\u20132 periods in concluded arrivals. On-hand=50, in-transit=340 (pipeline large). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of all observed concluded lead times (captures the 1\u20132 variability). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history\u2014this balances the higher recent demand while leveraging all history and the computed lead time. No explicit changes to inflation of safety stock beyond backend formula given current pipeline volume and mixed lead-time evidence.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has shifted up starting Period 15 (179,182,149,116,147,167); recent 6-period regime appears sustained. In-transit=340; on-hand=0 so pipeline is substantial but arrivals will only be visible later. Use promised lead time (default=2) since concluded history shows mostly 1\u20132 periods and no new confirmed permanent lead-time change. For demand, use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (N chosen = regime length = 6). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters focus inventory on the new higher mean while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 (service emphasis but controlled safety).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand elevated vs early history (sustained higher demand since Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=507 (large pipeline). Observed lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; use a recent average to capture current mix. Set L via recent_N to rely on most recent lead-time evidence. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 16\u201321) so base-stock reflects current demand while avoiding diluting with older low-demand samples. This balances service level (avoid stockouts during elevated demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=507 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals are only visible next period(s). Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (multiple confirmations of 2 and several 1s); use calculated average lead time to let backend estimate current effective L. Demand shifted up starting Period 15 (sustained ~170 over P15\u2013P17 and elevated thereafter); use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift regime (Periods 15\u201322). This biases the base-stock toward higher on-hand to avoid stockouts given the sustained higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability to keep safety stock appropriate. Using calculate for L and recent_N for demand parameters balances service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume that the optimizer will reconcile.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 15 (avg ~170 over P15-17) already recorded. On-hand=98, in-transit=340 (healthy pipeline). Observed lead times vary but recent concluded messages support promised L=2; no sustained change in lead time or missing-shipment pattern requiring adjustment. To reflect the higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (capture last 9 periods since the regime runs P15\u2013P23, regime_length=9 -> N=9). sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These parameters raise the backend base-stock to cover the elevated (1+L)-period demand while keeping L at the promised 2 so the OR engine's pipeline accounting remains consistent with supplier promise and avoids overreacting to transient arrivals.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=37, in-transit=365. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20132), earlier delayed/lost shipments noted but recent arrivals (e.g. P23) align with promised lead time. Demand spiked around P15\u2013P17 but declined afterward; last 5 demand observations (P20\u2013P24 = 167,121,73,69,61) average ~98. To reflect the recent post-spike regime while avoiding overstock from the transient spike, set L to default (promised 2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the latest demand pattern and recent volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=365. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period lead times (many 1s and 2s); several earlier delayed shipments were noted but recent concludes (through Period 25) show normal arrivals. Demand: a prior spike (Periods 15\u201317) was observed but the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 21\u201325 = 121,73,69,61,59) indicate a lower recent mean. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the most recent low-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock modest to avoid excess holding cost given low recent demand while the calculated L lets the model account for the empirically observed lead-time mix.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12): recent demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning Period 15 (avg \u2248170 over P15\u2013P17 and elevated thereafter). On-hand=0, in-transit=365 (large pipeline; some earlier shipments were delayed but many later arrivals concluded with 1\u20132 period lead times). Observed concluded lead times average ~1.58 periods (mix of 1 and 2). To capture the confirmed higher demand regime I use a recent-window forecast for demand mean and volatility (so \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflect post-changepoint behavior). I let L be calculated from observed lead times so the OR backend uses empirical lead-time (vs promised) when forming base-stock. This balances higher service-level needs from the new demand regime while accounting for substantial pipeline inventory to avoid excessive over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-08-19 (P28). On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Recent demand (P23-P27) cooled to ~46-76/week vs earlier spike; no new sustained lead-time change observed. Keep promised lead time to let backend use contractual L=2. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the most recent low-demand regime (weeks 23-27 mean ~62), so base-stock will target current demand level and avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1. In-transit (420) already provides substantial coverage; the backend cap will limit orders.

Many past arrivals show actual lead times of 1\u20132, but no new sustained lead-time change. Use promised lead time to keep ordering aligned with supplier contract. Use a recent-N demand estimate (last 6 concluded periods) to capture the current lower-demand regime and reduce excess holding given holding cost >0.

Historical concluded lead-times show a mix of 1\u20132 periods with confirmed 2-period arrivals; no new sustained lead-time shift or new demand regime since prior insights. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and long-run demand statistics, use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (uses full history including the earlier demand spike) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=365. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W=1..3, most recent arrival: order P27 arrived P30 \u2192 W=3). Pipeline (365) is large relative to recent weekly demand (last 5 demands: 76,46,98,120,82 \u2192 avg ~84.4), so coverage appears adequate but lead time variability and past delayed shipments warrant using observed lead-time average rather than the promised value. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times. Demand parameters use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent 5-week demand regime (captures current lower-than-period-15 spike) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent mean/volatility. This balances a high service target (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies aggressive service) with reduced holding by using recent demand rather than the full historical mean. The large in-transit reduces immediate need for extra orders but averaging actual lead times accounts for variability and past delays.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand (Periods 27-31)= [46,98,120,82,44] (mean=78) after an earlier short-lived spike in Periods15-17. On-hand=0, in-transit=365 units (sizable pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed lead times is best estimate this period. Choices: L -> calculate to let backend use average observed lead time (captures variable 1\u20133 behavior). mu_hat -> recent_N with N=5 to target the most recent demand regime (Periods27-31 mean=78) so base-stock reflects current lower demand rather than the earlier spike. sigma_hat -> recent_N with N=5 to align demand volatility with the same recent window. These params balance service (use recent demand to avoid overstock) while pipeline (365 units) already provides coverage for upcoming demand; using recent_N reduces holding cost risk.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has returned to lower baseline (last 5 demands: 98,120,82,44,33; mean ~75). Pipeline shows In-transit=365 and On-hand=0 (large pipeline present; no new conclues this period). Lead times observed historically vary (samples: 2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,3 \u2192 avg 1.8). I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the most recent regime (captures post-spike reversion). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with the current low-demand regime while acknowledging variable lead time and the sizable in-transit inventory to avoid overstocking.

Demand has had a past spike (Periods 15-17) but recent weekly demand (Periods 31-33) is low, so do not change demand regime estimate; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend uses all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)).

Recent demand has settled to a low regime (latest 5 demands: P30-P34 = 82,44,33,46,47).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=365. Historical concluded lead times show variability (samples: 1,2,3) with average ~1.67 periods; shipments have occasionally been delayed but recent concludes up through Period 30 include a 3-period case. Demand has fallen in recent weeks (Periods 31-35 average ~41 units) versus earlier higher regime. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time (~1.67) rather than the promised 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime (Periods 31-35) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5). Sigma also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect reduced recent variability. These choices reduce ordering toward current lower demand while the calculated L accounts for variable/occasionally longer transit times and avoids over-ordering against possible delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: avg demand P31-35 = 41.2 vs prior ~86 (approx -52%), sustained 5 periods

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=365. Profit=$4, Holding=$1 => high service target (q=0.8). Recent concluded history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133) but no new sustained lead-time shift or demand regime change since last recorded insights. In-transit stock (365) likely covers multiple periods; use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand estimates so OR backend computes base_stock and caps using full historical sample stats. This is conservative given no new 3+ period sustained signal and avoids overfitting to recent low demands.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Recent demand has settled into the lower regime identified at Period 31 (carry-over): recent demands P31-37 = [44,33,46,47,36,30,44], mean \u2248 40 over 7 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=365 (ample pipeline). Observed lead times in history vary, and promised lead time is 2; no new sustained lead-time change since prior confirmation. To reflect the confirmed lower demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=7) to forecast (1+L)-period demand variability; I keep L=default (promised) so the OR backend uses the contractual lead time. This keeps target base-stock modest to avoid holding cost while pipeline covers several weeks of demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has remained in the low regime detected earlier (Periods 31-38: demands = 44,33,46,47,36,30,44,34; avg \u224839). On-hand=0, in-transit=365 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple (1+L) periods so avoid inflating target. No new sustained change in lead time; observed lead times historically variable but no recent shift. Set L=default (promised 2). For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the confirmed low-demand regime (N=8 covers P31-38). Use same recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce service-level targets relative to historical high regime and limit holding costs given large in-transit volume.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been in a lower regime over Periods 35-39 (36,30,44,34,29) vs earlier higher spikes. On-hand=0, in-transit=365 (large pipeline) so risk of overstock if we forecast high demand; promised lead time=2 but historical arrivals show 1\u20133 variability and some lost/delayed shipments earlier. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time while acknowledging variability via conservative safety stock. For mu_hat I use recent_N N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (reduces target base stock vs using older high-demand samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect current lower volatility. These parameters reduce ordering to match the recent low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost given the large in-transit inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 31 (avg ~38 over P31-40 vs prior ~86); on-hand=0, in-transit=365 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times include multiple 2-period observations and some 1\u20133 variability; using calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I choose recent_N (N=10) to capture the low-demand regime (Periods 31\u201340) so mu_hat reflects current lower demand and avoids overstocking the large in-transit. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=10) to reflect current reduced volatility. These choices reduce holding cost risk while maintaining service for the current regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=365. Historical concluded lead times (observed): [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,3], average ~1.69. No new sustained demand/lead-time shifts since prior insights. Use calculated average lead time to let backend adapt to observed variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand over (1+L) periods from full sample history; this balances service level (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.8) against holding cost given current sizable pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=365 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) but promised lead time remains plausible; no sustained lead-time shift confirmed beyond prior insights. Recent demand (Periods 38\u201342 = 34,29,37,48,91) shows a modest uptick in the last week (mean \u224847.8) but no new sustained regime change. To avoid overreacting to the single large demand spike (91) while accounting for current higher near-term demand, I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime; keep L at default (promised=2) since concluded lead-time evidence is mixed. This balances service (use recent demand signal) against holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=365. Historical concluded lead-times cluster around 2 (confirmed at P6) with some variability; no sustained multi-period deviation from promised L=2 since prior confirmation. Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 31 (P31-43 demands: 44,33,46,47,36,30,44,34,29,37,48,91,59) \u2014 majority are low with one recent spike (P42=91). I therefore keep L as default (promised=2) but forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime to avoid overstocking: mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 31\u201343) to capture the current lower mean and volatility. This balances service level (covers the current low regime) while limiting holding cost given large in-transit volume. No new sustained lost-shipment pattern detected to record.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=365. Recent history shows demand collapsed to ~30-50 in Periods 31-39 then rose late Nov/Dec (periods 42-44: 91,59,103) \u2014 no clear sustained new regime of 3+ periods. Lead time historically mixes 1-3 but prior carry-over noted confirmed L=2 earlier; no new conclusive lead-time shift. I select default lead time (use promised L=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain arrivals: using defaults avoids overreacting to recent noisy spikes while pipeline (365) already provides coverage.

Recent demand (Periods 41-45 = 48,91,59,103,94) averages ~79 \u2014 higher than the low regime earlier but variable. I choose L=default to trust promised 2-period lead time, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-regime demand level and recent volatility so the OR backend targets service while limiting holding given $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=365. Profit=$4, holding=$1 -> target service quantile q=0.8. Recent concluded history shows noisy/variable lead times (1\u20133) but no new sustained shift since prior insights; demand has returned to mid-range with many zero-order periods followed by spikes earlier in year. Large in-transit (365) likely covers multiple weeks of demand; no confirmed lost-shipment pattern in the concluded history since prior carry-overs. Given lack of a new, sustained changepoint and the sizable in-transit pipeline, use default (promised) lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full historical mean/variance and respects pipeline. This balances service level (q=0.8) against holding cost while avoiding unnecessary fresh ordering that could double-count the large in-transit quantity.
