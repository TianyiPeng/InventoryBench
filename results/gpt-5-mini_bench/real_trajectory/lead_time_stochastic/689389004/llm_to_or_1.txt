Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No concluded arrivals or in-transit inventory; on-hand=0. Historical weekly samples (5 weeks) show rising demand (60,56,82,71,107) suggesting a recent upward level; no confirmed lead-time deviations. Use promised lead time to avoid premature assumptions, use recent_N=5 to capture the recent upward demand for review+lead period, keep sigma default to reflect full-sample volatility. This balances service (capture increased demand) versus holding cost (not using an explicit oversized forecast).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=109 from Period 1 order (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude is expected given promised L=2). Historical demand samples (5 weeks) have mean=75.2/wk; no sustained changepoint or lead-time evidence yet. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and no confirmed shifts. This approach also avoids overreacting to the single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=217 (orders placed earlier not yet observable per lead-time visibility rules). No concluded arrivals exist so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Recent demand shows higher values in the last two weeks (86,151) but this is <3 periods so not a sustained regime change. Use promised lead time and historical-sample defaults to let OR backend compute base-stock and caps from full-sample statistics.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=263. Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 show arrived=0 in Period 3 conclude despite promised L=2 \u2192 evidence of delayed/lost shipments. To be conservative I assume longer lead time to cover additional pipeline risk: set L explicit=3. Demand shows recent elevated variability (recent sold/demand: 86,151,78); I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime. Using (1+L)\xd7recent mean helps the OR backend size base stock to cover the longer effective lead time and recent demand level while recent sigma captures volatility for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed missing arrivals: orders placed P1\u2013P3 have not arrived by P3 conclude (arrived=0) \u2014 suggests delayed or lost shipments; treat effective lead time as longer than promised until arrivals confirm otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weekly demand samples: [60,56,82,71,107], mean=75.2. On-hand=46, in-transit=312 (total pipeline=358) \u2014 inventory well above (1+L)*mean. Observed arrival in Period 4: order placed P2 arrived with lead_time=2 (matches promised). Earlier missing arrivals were noted but evidence is not yet a sustained (>3 periods) lead-time shift. Therefore use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates: L = default (promised=2); mu_hat = default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples); sigma_hat = default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR backend using full historical mean/variance while avoiding overreacting to transient missing shipments; current on-hand+pipeline already covers the forecasted (L+1) demand, so orders will be restrained by the capped policy.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand (Periods 1-5) shows elevated and variable weekly demand (86,151,78,62,57). On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (some prior orders delayed but one arrival confirmed: P2\u2192P4). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead-time evidence rather than promised. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime including the spike in P2; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 5 demands) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(recent 5 demands) (backend will compute). This balances service (cover near-term elevated demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5), and accounts for the confirmed lead time and recent demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order on Period 2 arrived in Period 4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand (Periods 4-6) = [62,57,81]; on-hand=0, in-transit=312 units which greatly exceeds expected short-term demand. Concluded history shows an observed lead time of 2 periods (use observed-average). To avoid additional ordering given large pipeline, set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demand samples (captures the current lower post-arrival regime). This keeps target base-stock tied to recent realized demand and prevents aggressive replenishment while in-transit inventory is high.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has risen vs. the older sample set (recent demands: 62,57,81,117 \u2192 mean\u224879). On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (multiple prior orders outstanding; arrivals in prior periods confirm at least some shipments experienced delays but Period 6 confirmed a 2-period lead time for one order). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (leveraging the confirmed 2-period evidence). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the newer, higher-demand regime (covers the last four observed demands after arrivals: 62,57,81,117). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base stock to better cover the elevated recent demand while keeping variability consistent with recent observations; using calculate for L lets the backend adapt if further concluded arrivals revise lead-time estimates.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent concluded history shows large demand weeks (57,81,117,141) and current on-hand=0, in-transit=312. Period-level evidence (P4 conclude) and prior carry-over confirm actual lead time = promised 2 periods. Use default lead time to reflect confirmed L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (uses provided 5 weekly samples) \u2014 this balances service level (covers multi-period demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost. Default methods also avoid overreacting to recent volatile weeks while sizable in-transit stock (312) reduces urgency to inflate forecasts.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent observed demand (Periods 4\u20139) shows higher weekly demand versus the historical sample set. Pipeline shows 312 in-transit, on-hand 0; overdue/missing arrivals were previously observed but Period 6 confirmed a 2-period lead time for at least one order. I therefore keep L as default (promised 2) and downweight long-run samples by using recent data: set mu_hat based on the most recent 6 periods to capture the higher recent demand, and set sigma_hat based on the same recent 6 periods to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (respond to higher recent demand) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Periods 4\u20139 (2019-03-04 to 2019-04-08) avg demand = 88.3 vs historical sample avg = 75.2 (+17.4%) \u2014 sustained for 6 periods.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (order P2 arrived P4) and recent sustained demand uptick (Periods 4\u20139 avg=88.3 vs historical 75.2). Many earlier orders were delayed but later confirmed; treat promised lead time as reliable now. To capture the recent higher demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to weight the most recent 6 demand periods (covers the detected regime). L left as default (promised lead time = 2) because concluded arrivals support it. This balances higher safety stock for elevated demand while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed arrivals to avoid over-ordering against potentially lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (order P2 arrived P4). Demand regime shift previously detected (Periods 4\u20139 avg 88.3 vs historical 75.2). I use L=default (promised lead time=2) because concluded history supports promised LT. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the 6-period regime evidence). Sigma also uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the base-stock toward the higher recent mean while keeping LT consistent with observed concluded arrivals, helping balance service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit) vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Observed lead time samples show confirmed 2-period arrivals (order P2 \u2192 arrived P4); no new contradictory conclues. Recent demand since the detected regime shift (Periods 4\u201312) is elevated vs historical. To reflect confirmed lead time evidence I set L='calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 4\u201312) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to improve service during the higher-demand regime while using observed lead-time data to avoid under/over-stating pipeline needs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical samples show a sustained demand uplift in Periods 4\u20139 (avg 88.3 vs historical 75.2, +17.4%) recorded in carry-over. Lead time evidence (Period 4 conclude: order on P2 arrived in P4) confirms at least some deliveries with LT=2. Given confirmed higher recent demand regime, I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=2, and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the detected 6-period elevated regime (N chosen = regime_length per rules). This raises the base-stock to better cover the (1+L) demand during the elevated regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variance; this balances higher service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetric.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4); earlier missing arrivals noted but later evidence supports promised L=2. Recent demand exhibited a regime uplift around Periods 4\u20139 (recorded previously), but latest periods (11\u201314) show lower/variable demand; no new sustained shift. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand statistics so the OR backend applies the full-sample mean/variance (1+L horizon) and balances service level vs holding cost given current pipeline of 312 units.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical concluded lead-time evidence: one observed lead_time=2 (order on P2 arrived P4); no sustained alternative lead-time pattern \u2014 use calculated average to reflect observed data. Demand: recent weeks (P13\u2013P15) show much lower demand (35,31,25) vs earlier elevated period (P4\u2013P9). To adapt gradually to this drop while retaining some memory of recent variability, use an EWMA demand forecast (gamma=0.3). Keep sigma at default (uses all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the backend retains conservative dispersion for safety given lost/delayed shipments. These choices balance service-level (protect against in-transit uncertainty) and holding cost (downweight older high-demand periods).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical samples show a previous higher regime (Periods 4\u20139) but demand has dropped sharply and sustained in the most recent 4 periods (P13\u2013P16: 35,31,25,17). Lead time has been observed as 2 periods (confirmed earlier) and promised is 2. To respond to the new low-demand regime, set L to default (promised=2) and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained low-demand samples. This reduces ordering to match the sustained lower demand while the in-transit pipeline (312 units) provides coverage for upcoming periods; using recent_N helps avoid overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: Periods 13\u201316 avg demand = 27 vs prior recent avg 88.3 (\u221269.5%); sustained low-demand for 4 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, In-transit=312. Recent demand has remained in the low regime since Period 13 (periods 13\u201317: 35,31,25,17,27), so I base forecasts on the most recent low-demand regime. Promised lead time is 2 and recent concluded lead-time evidence (order on P2 arrived P4) supports using the promised L. Set L to default (promised=2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (5-period regime length). This keeps the OR base-stock focused on the lower recent demand while the large in-transit pipeline (312) will provide coverage for upcoming periods and reduce new ordering pressure.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Recent demand has shifted to a lower regime since Period 13: recent 6-period avg demand = 24.33 units/week. Lead time observation history includes a confirmed 2-period arrival (P2\u2192P4). Given confirmed LT=2 and a sustained low-demand regime (Periods 13\u201318), I set L by calculating observed lead times and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand from the recent low regime. This keeps service where needed while avoiding excess holding cost because in-transit inventory already far exceeds forecasted (1+L)\xd7mean demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical concludes confirm at least one realized lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 13 (avg \u224823.6 over last 7 periods). Reconcile: pipeline (312) is ample vs very low recent demand; to avoid excess holding cost, we use an inferred lead time based on observed concludes and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Choices: L: calculate (uses observed lead times -> avg=2). mu_hat: recent_N with N=7 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 7 low-demand samples, capturing the sustained downshift. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=7 to reflect lower recent volatility. These settings steer the OR backend toward modest replenishment (service with low overstock) given confirmed lower demand and existing large in-transit position.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead-time evidence: a 2-period lead-time was observed (Period 2 order arrived Period 4); no other arrivals concluded, but that confirmed 2 as observed. I set L by calculate to use observed lead-time data. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 13\u201320). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=8 to capture current volatility. These choices reduce replenishment targets to match lower demand and avoid excess holding costs given holding=profit=$1/unit.

Lead time previously confirmed as 2 and no new lead-time evidence, so keep promised lead time. To avoid over-ordering given large in-transit and sustained low demand, set L=default (use promised 2). For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N over the recent low-demand regime to reflect the new lower mean/variance: mu_hat recent_N N=9 (Periods 13\u201321) and sigma_hat recent_N N=9. These parameters reduce target base-stock to match the lower regime and limit additional ordering while the in-transit stock arrives.

Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-time evidence shows confirmed 2-period lead time (order P2\u2192arrived P4). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 13; recent 10 concluded demands (P13\u2013P22) avg \u224828.8, so I use a recent_N=10 forecast to reflect the current low-demand regime. I set L to calculate (backend will average observed lead times, which are 2). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the current low-demand regime, avoiding overweighting earlier high-demand weeks while the large in-transit quantity reduces the need for aggressive ordering; this balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 13 (avg ~27 over P13\u2013P16) but the last 11 weeks (P13\u2013P23) show a new mixed low-to-moderate regime (samples: 35,31,25,17,27,11,19,17,46,60,33). On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (sufficient pipeline for several weeks). No new confirmed lead-time change since Period 6 (lead time=2). I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (2) and use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent regime (captures the sustained low period plus the recent uptick) while avoiding overreacting to single-week spikes; this balances service level (use pipeline) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been low and stable since the low-demand regime detected in Periods 13\u201316; historical samples available from Feb\u2013Feb provide baseline. On-hand=0, in-transit=312 \u2014 substantial pipeline present, so avoid inflating forecast. Lead-time evidence: confirmed observed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4); earlier missing arrivals noted but later confirmation supports using observed average. Choose L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, which keeps orders conservative given sizable in-transit and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 13 (recent 13-period mean \u224829 units vs historical mean 75.2). Earlier missing arrivals were observed but lead time was confirmed as 2 in Period 6 and no new concluded arrivals contradict that. To match the current low-demand regime and limit holding cost while preserving service, I use promised lead time (default) and compute demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 13 periods (N=13) to reflect the sustained drop in demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (large pipeline arriving later) and historical concluded lead time=2. Demand has been in a low regime since Period 13 (sustained ~14 periods). To avoid overstock given large in-transit inventory and equal profit/holding cost (q=0.5 \u2192 moderate service target), I use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime (last 14 concluded periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean and volatility. This reduces new ordering while the in-transit stock clears, balancing service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical sample mean=75.2 (samples from 2019-01). Concluded arrivals show at least one observed lead time = 2 (order on P2 arrived P4), so use calculated lead time. Use default demand scaling ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base stock and cap; this balances the recent confirmation of L=2 with the long-run sample mean while the large in-transit quantity (312) will be considered by the backend pipeline offset.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand (Periods 21-28) = [46,60,33,27,31,41,59,79], mean=47.0 \u2014 demand has recovered from the low regime earlier in the year. On-hand=0, in-transit=312 units (covers upcoming demand). Historical concluded lead time evidence shows a 2-period lead time (Period 4 conclude). I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times (avg observed = 2). I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current summer demand regime (most relevant for the next (1+L)=3-period pipeline) and avoid contamination from earlier higher or lower regimes. This keeps target base-stock aligned with current demand while the in-transit stock reduces immediate ordering; it balances service level (using recent demand to avoid understock) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical base samples mean=75.2 (weekly). Recent weeks (Periods 21\u201329) show variable demand with no new sustained regime shift. Earlier missing arrivals resolved and lead time was later confirmed as 2; no persistent lost-shipment signal now. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (confirmed historically). Use EWMA_gamma for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to bias the (1+L) demand forecast toward recent weeks while retaining historical weight given variability. Use sigma_hat=default to keep volatility anchored to full-sample variability. This balances service (capture recent upticks) against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical confirmed lead time=2 (Period 6 evidence) and a demand regime shift to lower demand beginning Period 13 (sustained). Recent demand (Periods 13\u201330) shows a lower, stable regime; I use that regime for forecasting. Set L to default (promised 2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 (Periods 13\u201330) to capture the sustained low-demand regime; the in-transit pipeline (312) comfortably covers (1+L)=3 periods of expected demand under this recent estimate, avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock while preserving service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Recent 11 demand samples (Periods 21\u201331) average ~49.45/wk; given promised L=2 and recent moderate demand, use recent_N (N=11) to capture the current lower post-shift regime. Keep L as default (promised lead time) because lead time was previously confirmed as 2 and no new concluded arrivals indicate a persistent change. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=11) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u2248 3\xd749.45; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=11) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (use recent demand to avoid overstock given large in-transit) vs holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical baseline sample mean=75.2 (early 2019). Recent history (Periods 13\u201332) shows a sustained lower-demand regime; last 20 concluded weekly demands (P13\u2013P32) average = 39.5, std captured from same window. Earlier missing arrivals were resolved and lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods from concluded messages. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime while respecting observed lead-time evidence and the large in-transit stock, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (lets backend confirm average of concluded lead times). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent N=20 samples (captures the sustained lower-demand regime P13\u2013P32: mean=39.5) so the OR engine targets a base-stock consistent with current demand, avoids overstocking given holding cost equals profit, and leverages existing in-transit inventory to cover upcoming demand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent observed demand (Periods 13\u201333) shows no new sustained regime shift since previously recorded low-demand regime; historical sample mean = 75.2 used as stable baseline. On-hand=0, in-transit=312 which likely covers several weeks of demand given promised L=2. Past missing arrivals were resolved and lead time was previously confirmed as 2 (Period 6); no new lead-time evidence. To avoid overfitting to short-term noise and to let the OR engine apply its base-stock calculation (which uses promised L and historical stats), I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend uses promised lead time and historical sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps service-level provisioning while avoiding undue inventory build from transient signals.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Promised lead time=2; most recent concluded lead-time evidence (Period 6) confirmed LT=2 and no new sustained lead-time shifts or consistent missing-arrival pattern since. Demand has shown earlier regime shifts but no new sustained change in recent concludes. I therefore use default lead time (promised=2) so the OR backend applies its standard pipeline logic; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5). This avoids overfitting to short recent variability while the large in-transit quantity (312) will provide coverage for upcoming periods unless arrivals are lost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent concluded history shows on-hand=0 and in-transit=312 units (large pipeline). Past evidence: earlier missing arrivals were resolved and lead time was confirmed as 2 in history; no new sustained lead-time shift observed. Recent demand (most recent 20 weekly samples) is lower than the early-sample mean, so I use a recent-N demand estimate to reflect current regime. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (2) because concluded arrivals confirm the promised lead time historically and there is no new sustained delay. Use mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to capture the recent demand regime over the last 20 periods and avoid reverting to the older higher mean. Use sigma_hat=default to let backend compute volatility from full samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (using recent demand to avoid excessive inventory) while backend cap plus large in-transit stock will prevent over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = promised 2 periods (e.g., P2\u2192P4). Recent demand (Periods 17\u201336) has been relatively stable without a new sustained regime shift; to capture recent behavior I use a recent-window demand forecast. Set L to promised lead time to match supplier promise and confirmed evidence. Set mu_hat using recent_N to focus the (1+L) forecast on the latest 20 observations (balances responsiveness vs noise). Keep sigma_hat at default to let backend compute volatility from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L). This combination keeps orders aligned with the confirmed lead time, emphasizes recent demand for mean, and relies on default volatility to avoid overfitting sparse recent variance estimates. In-transit (312) will be subtracted by the OR engine when computing order quantity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical concluded lead-time observations show confirmed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived Period 4). No new sustained demand or lead-time signal since prior carry-over insights. Use calculate for L to reflect observed lead times (avg of concluded samples = 2). Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, leveraging all data while honoring the lead-time estimate; this balances service-level (profit=holding) and holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand 0, in-transit 312 (orders placed earlier not yet concluded). Historical demand shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 13 (recent weekly demands mostly in the 20\u201360 range, recent 20-period window captures this new regime). Promised lead time remains 2 periods and recent concluded arrivals support L=2, so use default for L. To align the OR backend with the sustained lower-demand regime, use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=20 (captures the most recent stable low-demand behavior). This reduces target base-stock and holding risk while maintaining service for current demand levels; it also accounts for (1+L) review+lead aggregation implicitly in backend.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (arrived P4 for order on P2) and earlier missing arrivals were resolved; no new sustained lead-time signal. Recent demand shows variability but no new multi-period (>3) sustained regime change since prior carry-over insights. Therefore use default promised lead time and default demand/mix estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps parameters conservative given the sizeable in-transit pipeline and avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 34 (weeks 2019-09-30 onward); last 7 observed demands (P34\u2013P40) average \u224825 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (large pipeline). Earlier carry-over confirmed lead time=2 at Period 6 and missing arrivals were earlier but no new lead-time evidence since. I choose L=default (use promised lead time=2) because recent concluded arrivals do not contradict promised LT. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (N=7 equals recent regime length) so the backend sizes base stock to the current lower demand while the large in-transit pipeline prevents over-ordering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (no recent conclude confirming arrivals) \u2014 overdue/unconfirmed shipment risk persists but not yet proven lost. Historical demand shows a sustained low-demand regime beginning Period 13 and continuing through current period (recent weeks demand mostly low: e.g. Periods 39\u201341 = 14,9,12). I keep L at default (promised=2), use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the prolonged low regime: select N=20 (regime length >20, capped at 20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent 20 samples, reducing target stocking given low recent demand and avoiding excess holding cost while acknowledging in-transit uncertainty.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Historical concludes confirm intermittent missing arrivals early but lead time was later observed as 2 periods; recent demand regime has been low and stable since Period 13 (sustained). I keep L at promised (default) because concluded history includes periods confirming 2-period arrivals and no new evidence forcing an explicit longer lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the long low-demand regime to avoid inflating mu_hat with earlier higher-demand samples: select N=20 (captures most recent stable regime). I also set sigma_hat using recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap replenishment risk (lower holding cost) while matching current low demand and the visible in-transit stock (312) to avoid over-ordering.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Recent weekly demand (Periods 34\u201343) is low and stable (roughly 9\u201344, recent weeks 9\u201317), and prior confirmed regime shifts include a sustained low-demand period starting Period 13. No new sustained lead-time evidence; use promised lead time. To align the OR engine with the recent low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent N=10 samples (captures last 10 weeks) so forecasts and safety stock reflect current lower mean and volatility while avoiding overstock given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent observed demand (Periods 40\u201344 = 9,12,13,17,10) is low (avg \u2248 12.2) vs historical sample mean 75.2; maintain promised lead time (no new confirmed change) and forecast using a short recent window to capture current low-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (large pipeline) so avoid inflating target stock: set L=default (promised), mu_hat recent_N using last 5 periods to reflect current low demand, sigma_hat recent_N using last 5 to capture recent volatility. This reduces overstock risk while the backend caps orders by its cap parameter.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): current on-hand=0, in-transit=312. Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 13; latest weeks (Periods 26\u201345) show low weekly demand (typically 9\u201344). In-transit 312 already covers multiple weeks (L+1) at expected low demand, so use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using recent data to reflect the sustained low regime. Chosen L=default to keep promised lead time=2; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture the long, low-demand regime while smoothing noise. This balances service (avoid stockouts if shipments conclude) against holding cost (avoid overstocking the large in-transit position).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 13 (many weeks of single- and low-double-digit weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (large pipeline will cover upcoming demand). Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods (Period 6 evidence) and no new sustained lead-time disruptions observed. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=2). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the prolonged low-demand regime (use last 20 samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N N=20 so the OR engine captures recent lower variability. These settings bias ordering toward the current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding given holding cost equals profit.
