Date 2019-02-11 is just after the 2019-02-04 sample; no major apparel holiday forcing a one-off spike. Demand analysis: historical weekly samples provided (2019-01-07:60; 01-14:56; 01-21:82; 01-28:71; 02-04:107) give a 5-week average \u224875 units/week with a recent uptick to 107 on 2019-02-04. This is one recent high point but not yet a sustained regime change. Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised 2 periods; no concluded arrivals yet and in-transit=0. With promised L=2, per rules we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand because orders arrive after decision and during future periods. Inventory assessment: on-hand 0, in-transit 0, so we need to place an order to cover upcoming demand until arrivals. Cost tradeoff: profit = $1/unit but holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is expensive, so avoid large excess safety stock. Final order logic: use the 5-week average demand (~75/week) to cover 3 periods \u2192 target \u2248 3*75 = 225 units. This balances service coverage for the lead-time window while limiting expensive holding costs given limited evidence of a sustained demand shift.",
