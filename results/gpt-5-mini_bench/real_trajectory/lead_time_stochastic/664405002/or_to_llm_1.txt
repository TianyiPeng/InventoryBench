OR's capped base-stock recommends 0 units (profit=holding \u2192 critical fractile 0.5 \u2192 no safety stock). Given holding cost = profit, ordering unnecessarily risks negative contribution from carrying inventory. With in-transit=523 covering (L+1)=3 periods of typical weekly demand (historical mean \u2248 118 over samples provided earlier, and even the spike is covered by 523), and no sustained demand regime change meeting the 3+ period significance threshold, I will follow OR and place 0 units to avoid holding cost and because the pipeline likely suffices for the immediate lead time horizon.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference & pipeline: Concluded history confirms lead time = 2 for recent on-time arrivals and identifies Period 1 order (230) as likely lost \u2014 therefore treat reported in-transit=523 as containing a ~230 lost shipment and do NOT rely on it. Effective reliable pipeline \u2248 523 \u2212 230 = 293 units expected. Inventory & demand: On-hand=0, reliable pipeline (~293) >> one-period demand (recent weekly demands: 70\u201385, with a Nov spike of 308 as an isolated event). OR recommended 0 (base-stock logic with profit=holding \u2192 critical fractile 0.5 \u2192 no safety stock); given high in-transit and recent demand at ~70\u2013100/wk, we should avoid ordering to prevent holding cost. Decision: place 0 units. This avoids incurring holding cost on units already expected in transit and aligns with OR baseline; monitor next concluded periods for any additional lost arrivals and adjust if reliable pipeline falls below (L+1)-period demand cover.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order \u2014 reliable pipeline (523 shown minus confirmed lost 230 \u2248293) already covers expected demand for the lead+review horizon, so ordering risks extra holding cost.",
