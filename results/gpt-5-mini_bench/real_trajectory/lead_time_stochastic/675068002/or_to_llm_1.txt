OR recommended 140 based on historic mean and promised L; that understates current observed demand. Risk assessment: if the Period 1 high demand reflects a regime shift, we need inventory for up to 3 periods (L+1) of demand; if it's a one-off spike, heavy over-ordering increases holding cost. No sustained multi-period signal yet (only one high-demand period), so do not record a carry-over insight. Calculation and decision: conservatively assume elevated near-term demand ~158/week (use most recent realized demand) -> target pipeline+on-hand to cover 3\xd7158=474 units. Current pipeline/on-hand = 52 (in-transit) + 0 on-hand = 52, so order_raw \u2248 422. To balance stockout risk vs holding cost and given uncertainty and single-period spike, scale back from full replenishment but significantly increase above OR: place an order of 350 units (final).
