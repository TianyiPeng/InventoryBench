Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) shows mean = (9+6+16+8+14)/5 = 10.6. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Profit and holding cost equal => critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0) so target base stock equals mu_hat. No evidence of sustained demand or lead-time shift; use defaults to let OR engine apply historical stats and promised lead time. This balances service level and holding cost given symmetric unit economics.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3: 30, 55, 59) is a sustained, large upward shift vs. historical sample mean (~10.6). Orders placed in P1-P3 (18,24,18) have produced zero arrivals by Period 3 conclude, indicating shipments are delayed or lost; therefore I increase the operational lead time estimate to 3 to be conservative. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime (last 3 periods) to capture the new higher mean and volatility. This raises the base-stock target to service the higher demand while acknowledging delayed arrivals by extending L so pipeline calculations cover the longer effective lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean ~10.6 -> recent avg 48.0 (Periods 1-3). Missing arrivals for orders placed P1-P3 (18,24,18) with arrived=0 through P3 conclude; treat effective lead time as >=3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand jumped vs historical (historical mean ~10.6; recent demands P1-P4 = 30,55,59,43). Pipeline shows 110 in-transit but several early orders did not arrive (P1,P3 arrived=0) while P2 arrival confirmed with lead_time=2. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed = 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher-demand regime (4-period recent regime: 30,55,59,43). I use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias stocking toward the new higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute base-stock and cap using observed lead times and recent demand stats; this balances service level given missing earlier arrivals versus holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent observed demand has jumped vs. historical 2019-Jan samples: Periods 1-5 demands = [30,55,59,43,42] indicating a new higher-demand regime (avg ~45). There are missing arrivals early (P1,P3) but P2 order arrived with lead_time=2, so promised lead time=2 remains plausible; in-transit=141 provides substantial pipeline but recent conclude shows an arrival gap in P5. To capture the higher recent demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (recent_N, N=5) so the OR engine targets inventory for the new regime. I keep L=default (promised 2) because we have confirmed at least one arrival with lead_time=2 and evidence for systematic longer lead time is not yet sustained. These choices raise target stock to meet current ~45/week demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent demand has clearly risen vs. historical Jan samples (periods 1-6 demands: 30,55,59,43,42,70). On-hand=0, in-transit=110 (covers some upcoming demand but arrivals have been inconsistent historically). Observed concluded lead times: order on P2 arrived in P4 (LT=2) and order on P5 arrived in P6 (LT=1) \u2014 average observed LT=1.5. Use L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times. Demand appears to have shifted to a higher regime starting Period1 of this episode; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (last 6 demand samples) so the (1+L)-scaled mean/volatility reflect the new higher demand. This raises target base-stock to avoid stockouts while sigma from recent data sets safety stock.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=150. Recent demand volatile with a huge spike (P7 demand=272) but only two concluded lead-times observed (P2->P4 = 2, P5->P6 = 1). Several earlier orders (P1,P2,P3) showed delayed/missing arrivals historically; however recent concluced arrivals indicate lead time around 1\u20132. I choose to let the backend compute an empirical lead time from observed concluced shipments (method=calculate) so the OR engine adapts to the mixed evidence. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so the backend applies (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) given limited sustained regime-change evidence. This balances service (by using observed lead times) against holding cost and avoids overfitting to the single large spike.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=116. Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = {P2->4:2, P5->6:1, P7->8:1} and multiple earlier orders (P1,P3) had arrived=0 for many periods -> evidence of at least occasional multi-period delays; treat effective lead time as 3 to be conservative. Demand has clearly shifted up vs. historical 2019 samples (recent weeks show large spikes: 70,272,253). To balance service vs holding cost I set L explicitly=3 to protect against missing/delayed shipments, use EWMA (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat to bias forecast toward recent high demand without overreacting to extreme noise, and use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current elevated volatility from the last 5 demand observations.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has jumped sharply: last 5 concluded demands = [42,70,272,253,163] (avg 160). Many prior orders were delayed/lost (orders from P1-P3 never concluded) and in-transit shows 547 units; promised L=2 is unreliable. To protect service given the elevated recent demand, I set lead time explicitly to 3 (conservative upward adjustment). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current high-demand regime (mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples; sigma_hat scaled from std of last 5). This emphasizes service over holding given profit=holding and strong recent demand spike while acknowledging some in-transit stock exists.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent history shows a sustained, large demand jump starting Period 7 (272,253,163,169). On-hand=268 + in-transit=203 gives strong coverage but demand regime has clearly shifted up. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2,1} (avg ~1.4) so use calculated average lead time. For forecasting, use the most recent stable high-demand regime (Periods 7-10, N=4) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the new demand level while limiting excess holding cost given current high on-hand. Parameters chosen: L by calculate to reflect observed average lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: New sustained high-demand regime since Period 7: avg demand P1-6 ~49.83 -> avg demand P7-10 = 214.25 (+330%), consistent over 4 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 7 (avg P7-10 \u2248214.25) with observed lead times varying 1\u20132 periods (observed lead times: 2,1,1,2,1). Current on-hand 100 + in-transit 375 = 475 units; pipeline appears sufficient short-term but demand remains elevated. I set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the observed average lead time (captures recent 1\u20132 period behavior). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecasts to the new high-demand regime (uses the most recent 5 demand observations), so the OR backend will size base-stock and caps based on the elevated mean and observed variability, balancing service vs holding cost given current inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=515 (large pipeline arriving over past orders). Recent demand regime shifted up since Period 7 (avg ~214/week); recent demands P7-12 = [272,253,163,169,168,227]. Several earlier orders were delayed/lost but concluded lead-times observed = [2,1,1,2,1] -> use calculated average lead time. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the sustained high-demand regime (last 6 demand samples), so (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std reflect the new higher demand and recent volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N with N=4 to capture the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 7-10) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; use recent_N N=4 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet high demand while the large in-transit reduces additional ordering.

Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2] (avg \u22481.57) so use calculated average lead time. To capture the confirmed high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the 9 most recent periods (P7\u2013P15) so the base-stock reflects current elevated demand while sigma uses the same window for accurate variability. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2 periods); recent observed lead times (most recent 5) average ~1.6 so I use recent_N for L with N=5. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 7 (avg ~214); use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 demand samples (regime length=10) so the OR engine sizes base stock to this higher demand and retained volatility.

Observed concluded lead times vary (mostly 1\u20132); I let backend infer average lead time via calculate. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the most recent regime length (~11 periods, Periods 7\u201317) so the forecast and volatility reflect current elevated demand and variability. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand regime is the sustained high-demand regime that began in Period 7 (many weeks of 160-272 weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=485 (sufficient near-term cover but arrivals have variable lead times historically). Observed concluded lead times in history vary 1\u20132 periods with some earlier lost shipments; most recent concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2. I set L using recent observed lead times to reflect current variability. For demand I use a recent_N forecast covering the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201318) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and volatility; this balances service (profit and lost-sales cost equal) against holding cost by sizing base-stock to recent elevated demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=454. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 7 (many demands >150) so forecast should use recent data. Observed concluded lead times are 1\u20132 periods (no sustained >2), so use calculated lead time to let backend average observed values. I choose recent_N=13 for demand stats to capture the high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201319 inclusive \u2248 13 samples). Using recent demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the new higher demand while calculated L uses observed lead-time mix (1\u20132) to temper pipeline assumptions. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and high demand) against holding cost by relying on recent high-demand estimates rather than long-ago low-demand history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=570. Historical conclude messages show lead times fluctuate 1\u20132 periods with no new sustained shift; keep promised lead time. Demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 7 (P7\u2013P20 = 14 periods). To capture the elevated mean/variance, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime. Using recent_N with N=14 leverages the 14-period high-demand regime to size base stock appropriately (q=0.5 \u21d2 z*=0) while avoiding overweighting older low-demand samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but continued high demand) against holding cost.

These choices prioritize meeting the sustained high demand while avoiding under-forecasting given recent evidence of higher mean and variance.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 7 (much higher weekly demand ~200+ vs ~50 earlier). On-hand=12 and in-transit=454 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand. Early periods had missing arrivals, but concluded arrivals since Period4 provide observed lead times; their average ~1.6. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the recent high-demand regime to capture the new mean ((1+L) scaling applied by backend) and for sigma similarly to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep service high during the sustained elevated demand while avoiding overstating variability from the old low-demand regime.

Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times varying 1\u20132 periods with occasional earlier multi-period delays and some lost orders early; recent concluded arrivals (Periods 4\u201322) average ~1.55 periods. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 7 (recorded previously). To let the OR engine use observed lead-time behavior while keeping demand aggregation straightforward, I request the backend compute L from concluded lead-time observations (calculate). I use default demand and volatility aggregation so the engine computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), preserving the full historical sample base and letting the backend cap orders per its policy. This approach acknowledges past missing shipments by inferring actual lead time from concluded data while avoiding overfitting short recent spikes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 Period 25. On-hand=0, in-transit=520. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods) with some early lost shipments; no new sustained lead-time shift since prior insights, so infer L from observed history. Recent demand has moderated from earlier spikes; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 20\u201324 = 138,127,104,111,73) show a more stable recent mean (~110.6). To anchor the (1+L)-period forecast to the most relevant behavior, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets current demand while L is computed from observed lead times. This balances service (capture recent demand) versus holding cost (avoid overstock from earlier spikes).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded demand (Periods 21-25) = [127,104,111,73,78], recent mean ~98.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=520 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to short-term demand (520 > 3\xd7mean). Lead-time observations in history vary but recent concludes show arrivals consistent with promised L=2; no new sustained lead-time shift detected. I use L=default (promised 2) to align with supplier promise and OR engine assumptions. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current, lower post-peak regime (uses last 5 demands). Sigma set recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to current demand while relying on large in-transit inventory to cover risk of short delays.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=454. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,3) including a recent 3-period arrival (P23->P26). Demand has declined from the early large spike; the most recent 5 demands (P22-P26) are 104,111,73,78,67 \u2014 a cooler recent regime. I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 3-period event). For demand and volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the latest lower-demand regime so orders avoid excessive holding costs given high holding=profit. This balances service level against holding cost while acknowledging variable lead times and significant in-transit stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=454. Historical concluded lead times vary (1-3), most recently observed: 3 (order P23->arrived P26), 2 (P20->P22), 1 (P18->P19). Demand has been moderate in the last 5 periods (P23-P27: 111,73,78,67,85) after earlier high spikes; recent data better reflects near-term demand. To balance service vs holding cost with uncertain but recently elevated lead times, I use a recent average lead time (short window) and recent demand stats (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend can size orders to cover (1+L) periods of expected near-term demand while capping order size.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=454. Historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133) with some delayed/lost arrivals earlier; recent history (since Period 7) shows a sustained higher-demand regime. To capture the true lead-time variability I let the backend compute the observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). For demand I focus on the recent high-demand regime (use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the last ~20 weeks of demand) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean and volatility. This approach balances service (by sizing to recent high demand) while relying on the backend's lead-time calc to accommodate observed lead-time variability and delayed shipments.

Historical concluded lead times (observed) = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,3], avg \u2248 1.67 periods, so I use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Large pipeline (454) covers multiple periods of demand, so keep demand forecast method as default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and volatility as default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These choices let the OR engine adjust base-stock using observed lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats; this balances service (high in-transit cover) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20133 periods, including a 3-period arrival at P26), so I use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher, volatile regime since Periods 7\u201310 and remains elevated; to capture recent behavior I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast emphasizes recent high demand while smoothing noise. This increases target base-stock to protect service given long and variable lead times, but the capped order rule and holding cost tradeoff will limit excess inventory.

No recent short-term demand changepoint beyond the previously recorded high-demand regime; therefore use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (full-sample aggregation over review+lead period) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding.

Demand has shown a sustained high regime earlier (recorded), so rely on backend's full-sample demand estimate for stability given many samples and large in-transit position. Decisions: L set to calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat left as default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history, balancing service level with holding costs while respecting observed lead-time variability and large pipeline.

Recent demand (last ~10 weeks) is lower than the earlier high spike; to make the forecast responsive to current demand regime I use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the most recent demand behavior while the backend-calculated L captures observed lead-time drift. This balances service (using recent demand) against high holding cost by avoiding inflation from old high-demand spikes.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times (observed) average ~1.67 periods (samples: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,3) and arrivals have been intermittent; backlog/in-transit is large so rely on observed average rather than promised. Recent realized demand has dropped to the 30\u201350 range over the last five periods (Periods 30\u201334 average \u224842). I set L to 'calculate' to use the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (most relevant for next (1+L) periods) and to limit overweighting earlier high-demand spikes when stockouts later suppressed sales. These choices balance service (use observed lead time) and holding cost (use recent lower demand mean/volatility) given large in-transit volume.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand (Periods 29-35) is low and stable (~18\u201350/week) after earlier high-demand spikes (Periods 7-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=454 \u2014 substantial pipeline likely covers upcoming demand despite historical variable lead times and some lost/delayed shipments earlier. I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded lead-time evidence is mixed and the OR backend expects promised L; using default avoids overcorrecting for intermittent delays. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts on the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 29\u201335) so the base-stock targets won\u2019t overstock versus current demand. This balances service (use pipeline) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent weekly demand (Periods 32-36) is modest and shows no new sustained regime shift; existing carry-over notes already record prior high-demand regimes and lead-time irregularities. On-hand=0, in-transit=454 (large pipeline). I retain the promised lead time (default) because concluded messages show variable lead times but no recent consistent deviation; use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility to let OR backend compute base-stock while capping orders given the large in-transit quantity. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise and respects the backend's capped ordering policy.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=454. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods) including earlier lost arrivals but later confirmations; to be robust I use a computed average lead time. Demand returned to a low, stable regime over the recent weeks (Periods 28\u201337 mostly 40,43,39,42,50,38,18,32,23). I therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent regime to avoid overstating demand from earlier spikes (Periods 7\u201310). These choices balance service (use measured lead time) against holding cost (use recent low-demand mean/volatility), while acknowledging the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=454 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133 periods, average ~1.6); use calculated average lead time to let backend estimate effective L. Recent demand (Periods 27\u201338) shows a stable lower-demand regime (mean \u224840.7); use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the most recent regime and avoid inflating targets from older high-demand spikes. This balances service (use observed lead-time average) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. Recent concluded demand (Periods 35-39) is low (18,32,23,13,16) and the earlier high-demand regime (Periods 7-10) is not sustained into recent weeks. In-transit = 454 units and on-hand = 0; no new concluded arrivals since P39, so do not change lead-time estimate. I set L to default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 concluded periods) so mu_hat focuses on current low-demand regime. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the current low-demand pattern while accounting for pipeline inventory to avoid overstock given holding cost = profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has returned to a low, stable regime (Periods 35-40 avg \u224819.5/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=454 (large pipeline that will cover upcoming demand once it arrives). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average observed lead time \u22481.73. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low-demand regime (most relevant for next (1+L) periods). I match sigma_hat to the same recent window (recent_N N=6) so safety stock reflects recent volatility and limits excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=454 (large pipeline likely covers several future periods). Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed 1\u20133 periods); average of observed lead times \u22481.64. I set L to "calculate" so backend uses the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals, which reflects that actual lead time differs from the promised 2 but is not persistently 3. Demand history is mixed with past high-demand regimes but recent on-site weekly demand (Periods 31\u201341) is low-to-moderate and we currently have a large in-transit position, so use default demand and uncertainty estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base_stock while respecting the computed lead time. This balances service level (using observed lead time) against holding cost given the sizable pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=454. History shows variable actual lead times including 1\u20133 periods and multiple missing arrivals; earlier evidence (Period 26) confirmed lead_time=3 and several long/no arrivals, so I explicitly set L=3 to be conservative and cover delayed shipments. Recent demand since Period 24 is a low-demand regime (many weeks of ~15\u201350 units); I use a recent_N forecast to capture the current low-demand regime. mu_hat and sigma_hat use the last 19 demand samples to reflect the current regime and recent volatility, helping the OR backend size orders to balance service vs holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=454 \u2014 pipeline currently large but recent conclude messages show no arrivals for many weeks, so some in-transit may be delayed/lost; nonetheless we must plan with promised lead time. Promised L=2 chosen (default) so OR backend uses contractual lead time. Demand has been low and stable in recent weeks (last 5 demands: 16,15,15,35,6) after earlier volatile spikes; to capture the current low regime and reduce holding cost I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on the most recent stable weeks). These choices bias orders down (lower forecast and volatility) to avoid excess holding given large in-transit volume and equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5 implies moderate service target).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=454. Historical demand samples (early 2019) show low baseline (mean ~10.6) and later history contained earlier high-demand regimes already captured in carry-over insights; recent concluded periods (P40-P44) show low demand (15,15,35,6,1) with no new sustained shift. Several past orders experienced variable lead times and some delays, but no new consistent lead-time change observed in conclude messages. Use promised lead time (default) and default mu/sigma (back-end will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set). This keeps policy conservative given large in-transit volume and equal profit/holding cost (q=0.5), avoiding unnecessary fresh orders while pipeline arrives.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times show variability including a 3-period event; average of observed concluded lead times \u22481.67. Recent demand since Period 33 has been low compared with the earlier high-demand regime, so do not up-weight demand now. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to capture realized variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes demand across (1+L) periods from full sample history; with large in-transit position this avoids over-ordering while the averaged L accounts for occasional longer shipments.

Promised lead time is 2; no recent sustained evidence forcing a change, so use default promised L. To reflect the current low-demand regime I set mu_hat using a recent_N=6 (captures the last 6 weeks). Sigma_hat left as default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These choices keep base_stock conservative given low recent demand while the large in-transit volume reduces need for additional ordering and limits holding cost exposure.
