Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (weekly cadence). Historical weekly demand samples (5): [28,20,21,11,11] -> no clear recent regime shift or seasonal spike; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover review+lead. No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time (default) so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples for demand and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for volatility. This balances service level against holding cost given limited data and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 18.2 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=31 (order placed P1 not yet concluded\u2014consistent with promised lead time=2). No concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer a lead-time change or lost shipment. Use promised lead time to keep backend aligned with contract and use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base-stock from full historical sample mean/variance, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to a single pending shipment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent weekly demand samples: [28,20,21,11,11], mean=18.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=60. No concluded arrivals for recent orders (Period1/2 orders show arrived=0), so insufficient evidence to change promised lead time. Pipeline (60) already roughly covers the default forecast for (1+L) periods. Use default lead time and default demand statistics to let the OR engine compute base stock while avoiding overfitting to short noise.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand (concluded periods) is falling: 12, 10, 6 over the last 3 periods versus historical samples (28,20,21,11,11) indicating a downshift. On-hand=0, in-transit=60 (orders from P1/P2) but those orders have not concluded by their promised lead time (promised L=2) \u2014 evidence of shipment delays. To be conservative about supply delays, set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. For demand forecast use recent_N over the last 3 concluded periods (regime length=3) to capture the lower current demand; apply the same recent_N=3 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to reduce over-ordering given lower observed demand while accounting for delayed arrivals by lengthening L so the OR backend sizes orders to cover the longer effective pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent on-hand=24, in-transit=31 (pipeline=55). Historical weekly mean=18.2 (samples Jan 2019). Recent observed demand (Periods 1-4): 12,10,6,5 \u2014 a sustained drop versus historical. Period 4 conclude shows arrival of order placed in Period 2 with lead_time=2 (matches promised). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead-time evidence. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the recent lower-demand regime (gives (1+L)*mean of the last 4 samples to avoid overstock). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock compared to historical estimate, lowering holding cost while keeping service for the new lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived Period 4); Recent demand regime drop: Periods 1-4 avg=8.25 vs historical avg=18.2 (-54.6%), sustained over 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-03-18: recent demand has fallen sharply (Period1-5 demands: 12,10,6,5,2) vs historical weekly mean ~18.2. On-hand=22, in-transit=31 (no overdue arrivals beyond confirmed lead time). I set L=calculate to use observed lead-time evidence (observed = 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (5 most recent samples) so mu_hat reflects the current depressed demand across review+lead periods. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect reduced volatility in recent observations. These choices lower target base-stock to avoid excess holding while keeping service for near-term low demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=19, in-transit=31. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time=2 (Period 2 order arrived Period 4). Recent demand has dropped and stabilized: last 4 period demands = [6,5,2,3], mean=4. I set L by calculation to reflect observed lead time=2. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) so mu_hat reflects the lower recent regime: (1+L)*mean_recent = 3*4 = 12 forecast across review+lead. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering under the sustained lower-demand regime while honoring confirmed lead time and existing in-transit inventory.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. Recent demand has dropped and remained low over the last 4 periods (demands P4-P7 = 5,2,3,7 \u2192 mean 4.25). On-hand=12 + in-transit=31 => pipeline=43, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand given low recent demand. Lead time confirmed previously as 2; use calculated L to reflect observed history. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the sustained lower-demand regime and reduce overstocking risk while maintaining service. This keeps OR base_stock aligned to the new lower demand and limits holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=10, in-transit=31 (pipeline=41) covering many periods. Historical weekly samples show much higher historical mean (18.2) but recent weeks much lower. Observed concluded lead time(s): Period 2->4 => lead time=2. I therefore set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time. Demand appears to have shifted down; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the last 5 demand observations (Periods 4-8: 5,2,3,7,2) so the OR engine will target a lower base-stock and avoid excess holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: average demand over Periods 4-8 = 3.8 vs historical avg 18.2 (\u221279%), sustained 5 periods.

I set L=calculate to use observed lead-time evidence (observed lead_time=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed low-demand regime (5-period regime), and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent low volatility. These choices bias orders down to avoid excess holding while preserving service in the new low-demand regime.

Lead time previously observed as 2 periods (Period 2\u21924). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead-time history. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (last 5 demand observations) so the OR backend builds a much smaller (1+L)-period demand forecast and reduced safety stock, lowering holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand environment.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=31. Historical concluded lead-time evidence: Period2 order arrived in Period4 \u2192 observed LT=2 (use calculate). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period4 (recent samples show much lower mean than historical). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (avg=2). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=8 (most recent regime Period4\u201311, 8 samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 demands, capturing the lower current demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering against the sustained low-demand regime while honoring confirmed lead-time evidence; they lower target base-stock and cap risk of excess holding costs given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has settled low: last 5 periods demand = [2,2,4,5,8], mean=4.2 vs historical mean=18.2 (sustained drop). On-hand=0, in-transit=31 (one observed arrival gave lead_time=2). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time (evidence: Period 2 order arrived Period 4 => lead_time=2). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the confirmed low-demand regime (covers (1+L) review+lead window), reducing excess holding while maintaining service. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=31. Historical demand collapsed vs original historical mean; recent demand (Periods 9-13 = 2,4,5,8,4) averaged 4.6 units/week. I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded history established 2-period arrivals and no new sustained lead-time change is observed. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor the OR forecast to the current low-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples and sqrt(1+L)*std of last 5 samples). This reduces over-ordering vs using long-run historical mean while preserving service given existing in-transit stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has stayed at a much lower regime vs historical (last 5 demands: 4,5,8,4,0; avg=4.2), and on-hand=0 with in-transit=31. Previously confirmed lead time=2. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I use a recent_N demand estimate (captures current mean/volatility). L set to calculate to rely on observed concluded lead times (confirmed =2). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std, keeping orders aligned with lower current demand while avoiding overstock given holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been in a low regime (~4 units/week) since Periods 4-8 and confirmed through Periods 9-15 (recent 7-period avg \u22484.3). On-hand=0, in-transit=31 (likely the long-outstanding Period1 order; no recent concludes for it \u2192 treat as delayed/lost for planning). Lead-time evidence from concluded history shows actual L=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). I choose L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (use the last 7 demand observations) to capture the sustained low-demand regime and reduced volatility. This keeps base-stock low to avoid holding costs while preserving service for the current low-demand environment.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=31. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 4 showed arrival of Period 2 order). Recent demand has been low but variable; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 12-16) = [8,4,0,7,13], so I use a recent-N forecast to reflect the current low regime while remaining responsive to recent upticks. Set L via 'calculate' to use observed lead-time evidence (avg observed = 2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the most recent regime. This keeps target base-stock conservative given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4, while accounting for confirmed lead time and recent demand pattern; it also avoids inflating orders due to older higher historical averages and helps mitigate risk from potential lost shipments.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=0, In-transit=31 (some earlier shipments overdue/missing in concluded history). Demand: long run low regime since Periods 1\u20139, but a large one-off spike in Period 17 (demand=98). Spike is single-period (not yet sustained for 3+ periods), so I will not record a permanent regime change. Set L=calculate to use observed concluded lead times (observed=2) rather than promised blindly. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods: Periods 13\u201317 = 4,0,7,13,98) so the forecast and volatility reflect the recent spike while still being data-driven; this raises the base-stock enough to cover potential near-term demand but sigma captures increased uncertainty to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=124. Historical weekly mean~18.2 (Jan samples) but recent history showed prolonged low demand then two large spikes (P17=98, P18=73). Only one confirmed lead-time observation (order P2\u2192arrived P4 => LT=2). Shipments recently placed remain in-transit (no conclude yet). I set L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead-time average (captures confirmed LT=2). For demand I use an EWMA (gamma=0.5) to emphasize recent large demands while damping single-period noise, producing a (1+L)-period forecast that reacts to the recent surge without overfitting a two-period blip. Sigma_hat kept 'default' to use long-run volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (captures recent uptick) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and uncertain persistence of the spike.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand spike: Periods 17-19 demands = 98,73,41 indicating a new high-demand regime. On-hand=52, in-transit=131 (pipeline ample vs current on-hand). Lead-time observations: observed lead_times = {Period4:2, Period19:1} \u2014 mixed but recent shorter shipment seen. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures recent 1 and 2). Demand parameters use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 17-19) because a sustained demand uptick over 3 periods is detected; this focuses mu_hat and sigma_hat on the new regime and avoids understocking during the spike. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat raises the base-stock to better meet elevated demand while the OR cap limits extreme replenishment to control holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: Periods 17-19 avg = 70.67 vs historical avg 18.2 (+288%), sustained 3 periods

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand: P18=73, P19=41, P20=34 \u2014 clear spike vs historical (recent 3-avg=49.33 vs hist avg=18.2). On-hand=18, in-transit=202 (large pipeline available). Lead-time evidence: observed arrivals imply LT samples {2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P18\u2192P19)}; no sustained change to shorter LT yet. I choose L=calculate to use the average of all observed lead times (captures both 2 and 1). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the new high-demand regime (use periods 18\u201320) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 to capture current volatility. These settings steer the OR engine to raise target base-stock to service the elevated demand while the large in-transit stock and calculated LT balance holding cost risk.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand regime: large spike starting Period 17 (Periods 17-22 demand = [98,73,41,34,27,23], recent regime length=6, recent mean\u224849.33 over P17-22 but last-6 moderate mean of sales-capable periods = (73+41+34+27+23)/6\u224833; on-hand=48, in-transit=137 so pipeline is ample. Observed concluded lead times = {2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P18\u2192P19), 2 (P20\u2192P22)}; average \u22481.67. To capture the recent sustained high-demand regime (6 periods) I set L by calculation of observed lead times and use recent_N (N=6) for demand and volatility so the OR engine focuses on the latest high-demand regime while respecting observed lead-time variability. This balances service (avoid stockout during the post-Period17 spike) against holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent history shows volatile demand with a large spike in Periods 17-19 and subsequent high weeks (e.g. P23 demand=72). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P19:1, P22:2, P23:1} \u2192 avg = 1.5; current on-hand=0, in-transit=138 which already provides substantial cover. To let the OR engine account for the mixed observed lead times, set L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). Keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses the full-sample mean/variance (scaled by 1+L) and lets the large existing pipeline determine orders; this avoids over-ordering given 138 units already in transit while still reflecting historical demand variability.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile since Period 17 (several high-demand weeks: 98,73,41,34,27,23,72,42); on-hand=0, in-transit=138 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2 (P2\u2192P4),1 (P18\u2192P19),2 (P20\u2192P22),1 (P22\u2192P23)} \u2192 average \u22481.5; use calculated average lead time to let backend adapt to mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (last 8 periods: P17\u2013P24) so base_stock reflects current elevated demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate order size risk. This balances high service level (profit/holding -> q=0.8) against holding cost given substantial pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile: Periods 20-25 demands = [34,27,23,72,42,55], recent average = 42.17. On-hand=0, in-transit=193 (covers multiple outstanding orders). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods seen), so I ask backend to compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method: calculate). To reflect the recent higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (recent_N N=6) so the base-stock and cap reflect the recent surge while letting the backend compute the scaled (1+L) mean and volatility. This balances service (capture current high demand) against holding cost by tying forecasts to the most recent regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning at Period 17 (Periods 17-26 demands: 98,73,41,34,27,23,72,42,55,97) and multiple concluded lead-time observations: observed lead_times = [2 (P4 from P2), 1 (P19 from P18), 2 (P22 from P20), 1 (P23 from P22), 3 (P26 from P23)] (avg=1.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=186 (large pipeline). To reflect confirmed faster/variable lead times use L="calculate" (average of observed lead times). To capture the recent high-demand regime and its volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (using Periods 17\u201326 data) so the OR engine sizes base-stock and caps to the new regime while accounting for observed variability and the substantial in-transit stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent history shows volatile demand with a sustained high-demand regime since Period 17 (spike around Periods 17-27) and very large weekly demands in Periods 24-27 (42,55,97,123). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 154 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals uncertain due to variable lead times). Observed concluded lead times (most recent arrivals): 1,3,2 -> recent average \u22482. To reflect the recent elevated demand regime I use a short recent window for demand forecasting so mu_hat and sigma_hat follow the latest high-demand weeks; for lead time I use a recent_N average (N=3) to capture variability while remaining responsive. These settings aim to keep base-stock high enough to meet the recent spike while preventing excessive long-term overstock given holding cost $1 and unit profit $4.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime that began at Period 17 (large weekly demands continuing through Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=281 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are observed with variable lead times (observed arrivals show 1\u20133 periods). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20133 outcomes). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (regime from Period 17 onward, 12 periods long) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent average over the review+lead window. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=12 to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained high demand while letting the OR engine compute the service-level-based safety stock and respect the pipeline to avoid excessive holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 17 (Periods 17-29 mostly large spikes; Periods 17-19 avg=70.67 confirmed). On-hand=0, in-transit=281 \u2014 large pipeline that will cover multiple periods but arrivals may be spread/lumpy per past variable lead times. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,3,2} (avg\u22481.83), so I use a data-driven lead time estimate. To capture the confirmed high-demand regime I set demand forecasts using the recent regime (most recent 13 periods, Periods 17\u201329) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect elevated mean and volatility. These choices push the OR engine to raise base-stock to preserve service during the high-demand regime while acknowledging higher variability and the substantial in-transit inventory to avoid excessive new orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand is in a high regime (Periods 26-30 demands = 97,123,103,110,126) so I use recent demand stats to forecast; observed lead times have varied recently (1\u20133) so I use a recent average. On-hand=24, in-transit=131 gives substantial pipeline but demand remains elevated so I set L based on recent observed lead times to capture variability and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using the last 5 demand samples to reflect the current high-mean, high-variance regime. This balances higher service (to avoid lost sales during the surge) versus holding cost by limiting the horizon to recent data rather than all-time averages.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=264. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime in Periods 27-31 (demands: 123,103,110,126,127) and variable actual lead times in recent arrivals (observed lead_times sequence: 2,1,2,3,2,3,2). To capture the recent faster/higher-variance regime I set L to recent_N using the last 5 observed lead times (captures recent 2\u20133 period variability). I set mu_hat to recent_N using the last 5 demand samples (Periods 27\u201331) to reflect the current high-demand regime. I set sigma_hat to recent_N using the last 5 demand samples to reflect elevated volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward larger base stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained surge while using recent variance to temper overstocking given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: New sustained demand regime: Periods 27-31 avg demand = 117.8 vs historical avg 18.2 (+547%), sustained 5 periods (Period 27\u201331).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23): recent demand remains in the high regime (Periods 27-31 avg \u2248117.8 units). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133 periods) so use the empirical average. On-hand=33 + in-transit=237 provides large pipeline cover vs. high demand, so we avoid over-reacting by using recent demand stats rather than full-history mean. Choices: L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to target the new sustained high-demand regime (regime length=5); sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These parameters prioritize meeting high service needs while the cap limits over-ordering given pipeline stock.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 27 (Periods 27\u201331 avg=117.8) and continuing through Periods 32\u201333 (100,102). Lead times have become variable (observed concluded lead_times recent sequence: 3,2,3,2,1). On-hand=0, in-transit=326 (large pipeline). To capture the recent faster/slower mix I set L to recent_N (N=5) averaging the last 5 observed lead times \u22482.2 \u2192 backend will round/use average. Demand forecast should reflect the new high-demand regime, so mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) based on the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 29\u201333/most recent regime). Volatility is also taken from the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=5) to reflect elevated variability. These choices focus the base-stock on the elevated, recent demand while L based on recent lead times helps avoid underordering given variable arrivals; large in-transit reduces immediate order size but the backend will cap orders appropriately.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 17 with a pronounced peak from Periods 27\u201334 (weekly demands ~100\u2013127). On-hand=0 and large in-transit=358 units (covers multiple future weeks). Observed concluded lead times have varied (1\u20133); I use the historical average (calculate) for L to let the backend infer typical lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (captures Periods 27\u201334 high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock for the current high-demand regime while sigma reflects recent volatility. This favors service (q=0.8 implied by profit/holding) to avoid stockouts during the elevated demand, but using recent data limits overstock from older low-demand periods. No new missing-shipment pattern detected beyond variable lead times already observed.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 27 (Period 27-35 demands: 123,103,110,126,127,100,102,102,80; avg \u2248 109). On-hand=26, in-transit=252 \u2014 pipeline is large but shipments have exhibited variable lead times (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,3,2,3,2,1,3], mean=1.9). To capture the confirmed high-demand regime while accounting for variable/occasionally delayed arrivals, I set L to the observed average (calculate) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent sustained regime (9 periods) so forecasts and safety stock reflect current elevated mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the high regime) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 27 but falling from peak: last 5 demands (Periods 32-36) = [100,102,102,80,56], avg=88. On-hand=59, in-transit=232 \u2014 pipeline is healthy but lead times have been variable and often extended to 3 periods recently. I choose L as recent_N (N=3) to bias the backend toward the empirically recent lead-time behaviour rather than the promised 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated but slightly declining regime (uses last 5 samples). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand dispersion. These choices keep base-stock tuned to the current high-demand regime while accounting for the longer recent lead times to avoid stockouts and lost sales, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears to have shifted higher: observed 3-period lead times for orders placed on Period 27 (arrived P30), Period 32 (arrived P35) and Period 33 (arrived P36); consistent 3-period arrivals observed in at least 3 recent concldues.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 27 (weekly demands frequently >> historical mean) and multiple concluded 3-period lead times (orders placed P27\u2192arrived P30, P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36). On-hand=0, in-transit=235. I set L using recent_N to reflect the confirmed shorter-run shift to 3-period actual lead times. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (use last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given heavy recent demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than long-run historical averages.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand is in a high regime: last 5 demands (Periods 34\u201338) = [102, 80, 56, 69, 50], mean=71.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=272 (covers multiple weeks under elevated demand). Historical concldues show actual lead time has been 3 periods repeatedly; to avoid under-ordering I set L=3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (mu_hat computed over last 5 samples scaled by 1+L; sigma_hat uses recent volatility). This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302 for elevated demand and longer lead time) while avoiding excessive holding by using recent data rather than full-history smoothing.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 27-31 avg ~117.8) and multiple concluded arrivals indicating lead time has increased to ~3 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=25, in-transit=252 (covers upcoming demand if shipments arrive). I choose L='calculate' so the backend infers the observed average lead time from concluded messages (captures the recent shift to ~3). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to anchor mu_hat to the latest sustained high-demand regime (Periods ~27-31) so base-stock reflects current elevated demand; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand regime while the backend's capped order logic limits excess ordering to control holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=252. Historical demand shows recent elevated regime (Periods 27\u201336) with subsequent tapering but still above early historic lows. Multiple concluded arrivals indicate lead time \u22483 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let backend use empirical recent arrivals. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 7 demand observations (captures the elevated but tapering demand pattern) so the OR backend balances service level against holding cost given current in-transit stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been high since Periods 32\u201341 (10-period mean = 69.5/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=203; given multiple concluded arrivals showing 3-period shipments (Periods 27,32,33 arrivals), I treat lead time as 3 to avoid under-ordering. I set L explicit=3. To capture the recent high-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat => (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 periods (4\xd769.5 \u2248 278) and recent_N N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances maintaining service during the sustained high-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding cost by using recent data and the longer observed lead time.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent concldues show multiple consistent 3-period lead times (orders P27\u2192P30, P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39) so set L=3. Demand shifted to a high regime beginning ~Period 27 and persisted through Periods 27\u201341; to capture the new mean/volatility I use a recent_N window covering the most recent sustained regime (N=15, Periods 27\u201341). On-hand=0, in-transit=315 (large pipeline) \u2014 parameters aim to reflect elevated demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding cost.

Historical concldues (Periods 30,35,36 arrivals) and carry-over indicate lead time has shifted to 3 periods; recent demand has been volatile with several high-demand periods (noting spikes in P42-43). To capture the recent regime while avoiding excess holding, set L explicitly to 3 (reflecting observed arrival pattern). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent 5 demand observations so the OR backend computes a base-stock tuned to recent demand spikes while limiting inventory risk given high holding cost relative to profit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=691. Recent concldues show a sustained large demand spike in Dec (Periods 42-44) and multiple confirmed 3-period arrivals earlier (Periods 30,35,36 arrivals imply L=3). To protect service with profit=4/hold=1 (q\u22480.8) I set lead time explicit to 3. Demand forecast uses EWMA (gamma=0.5) to weight recent surge while retaining some history. Volatility is set from the most recent 5 periods to reflect current high variability. These choices bias the OR base-stock upward to cover (1+L) periods and high service target while sigma captures recent uncertainty so cap prevents extreme single-period ordering.

Carry-over insight: New sustained seasonal spike starting Period 42: Periods 42-44 avg demand = 196.67 vs historical avg 18.2 (+981%), sustained 3 periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent history shows a sustained large seasonal spike starting Period 42 (Periods 42-44 avg demand elevated) and multiple concldues confirming lead time = 3 periods (several orders observed arriving after 3 periods). Current inventory: on-hand=193, in-transit=460 (ample pipeline). To protect against stockouts during the confirmed high-demand regime while avoiding excess holding, set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use the most recent short regime (the spike) so mu_hat = recent_N with N=3 (captures Periods 42-44 elevated mean over the review+lead window). Volatility is also driven by the same recent regime, so set sigma_hat = recent_N with N=3. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed spike while letting the OR backend compute a capped order consistent with profit/holding tradeoff.

Multiple conclude messages indicate actual lead times recently ~3 periods (several 3-period arrivals), so use calculated observed lead time. On-hand=71 and in-transit=460 provide substantial coverage vs. elevated demand; use recent 5-period demand stats to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet the Dec spike while capping orders via its cap. Methods chosen: L learned from history (calculate average observed lead times); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to reflect the new high-demand regime and recent volatility.
