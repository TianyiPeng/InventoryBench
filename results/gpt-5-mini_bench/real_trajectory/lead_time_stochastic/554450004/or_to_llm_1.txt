History shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133) and earlier lost-shipment signal (Period1 order likely lost) but that was already recorded in carry-over insights. The in-transit volume (455) is large relative to single-period demand (recent weekly demands typically 60\u2013200) and should cover the (L+1)=3 period demand exposure even if some transit units are delayed; therefore no immediate replenishment is needed. Placing new orders now risks higher holding cost ($1/unit/period) while profit per unit is $19, and we already have substantial pipeline that should arrive (some arrivals have been observed with variable lag). Action: follow OR and order 0 units to avoid unnecessary inventory and holding cost while relying on existing in-transit stock to satisfy upcoming demand. Continue to monitor concluded arrivals to detect any lost shipments or persistent lead-time increase before changing ordering behavior.",
