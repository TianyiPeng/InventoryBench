Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable non-seasonal demand; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes. Promised lead time=2 will be used (no evidence to change). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited history and no confirmed lead-time shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean \u2248352 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=522 (ordered Period 1, not yet concluded). Promised lead time=2 and we have no concluded arrivals to contradict it, so use default lead time to avoid overreacting to a single missing arrival. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, producing a base-stock consistent with historical demand (covers current + L future periods) while the pipeline 522 partially fills that target. This balances service level (protect against ~3 periods of demand) versus holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio (profit $4, holding $1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded periods show orders placed in P1 (522) and P2 (505) have not yet arrived (arrived=0), so there is possible delay but insufficient multi-period evidence to change promised lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=1027 (covers some future demand but arrivals not yet confirmed). I use default lead time (promised L=2) to avoid overreacting to potentially delayed or lost shipments. Demand history (five weekly samples from Jan 2019, mean\u2248352.4) used with default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level given profit/holding tradeoff while remaining conservative about unseen arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan 2019) avg ~352 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=1095; orders from P1-P3 have not concluded (arrived=0), indicating at least one missed arrival beyond promised L=2. To be conservative against possible longer actual lead time or lost shipments, I set L explicitly to 3 (one-period longer than promised). Using default demand/statistics lets the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples with the chosen L, preserving the historical mean while the longer L increases pipeline coverage to reduce stockouts given delayed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows one observed lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). On-hand=364, in-transit=861 (includes outstanding orders from P1,P2,P3,P4). Historical weekly demand samples (provided) have mean=352.4. I choose L=calculate to use observed lead-time average (2). I choose mu_hat=sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this yields a multi-period forecast that balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 moderate service target) while keeping volatility handled by default sigma. I flag no confirmed lost-shipment pattern yet (some earlier orders not yet concluded but one lead-time observation equals promised), so no explicit lead-time extension.

Daily Reward (R_t): $396.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent confirmed arrival: Period 4 conclude shows an order placed in Period 2 arrived with lead_time=2, so actual lead time aligns with promised 2. However some earlier orders (Periods 1 and 3) have not concluded and may be lost\u2014monitor but not yet enough sustained evidence to change lead-time. On-hand=212 + in-transit=861 provide pipeline coverage; using default demand estimates (all samples) scaled by (1+L) keeps forecast grounded in historical weekly demand while the OR backend computes safety stock from profit/holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=111, in-transit=861 (total pipeline=972) which currently provides strong coverage. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) and recent observed demands (Periods1-6) show a downward drift from earlier high January levels toward ~120-200 in March; Period4 conclude confirmed a 2-period arrival (P2\u2192P4). I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to lock in the confirmed 2-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent lower-demand regime (focus on the most recent 5 weeks rather than the older January peaks). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tied to the current lower-demand regime while the pipeline (visible + in-transit) already provides coverage; they avoid overordering given holding cost >0.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: P2 order arrived P4).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent history: steady weekly demand samples (historical mean \u2248352/wk); last observed periods saw depletion (Period 7 ended with 0 on-hand after stockout). On-hand=0, in-transit=861 (pipeline ample vs recent weekly demand). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 in Period 7 conclude; no evidence of further shifts. I choose default lead time (use promised 2), and default demand and volatility calculations so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean_all_samples and sigma = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all_samples. This keeps parameters tied to long-run sample statistics while the large in-transit quantity limits new ordering, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=895. Historical demand samples (weekly Jan\u2013Feb) have mean ~352.4. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 7 insight). Given confirmed LT=2 and a large in-transit pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean/variance. This balances high profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1) by letting the backend compute the service-level z from profit/(profit+holding) while capping orders using its cap rule. No evidence of a new sustained demand regime or lost shipments requiring explicit overrides.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=895. Historical weekly samples show demand dropped from winter (~350/wk) to recent run: Periods 4-9 demands = [141,152,101,124,141,88], recent mean\u2248124. Lead-time evidence (Period 4 conclude) confirmed 2-period actual for an earlier order; promised lead time=2. To avoid overstock given high pipeline (895) and lower recent demand, keep L as default (use promised 2). For demand forecast use recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (regime length=6 \u2192 N=6) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 demands (~124\xd73=372). Match sigma to recent volatility using recent_N N=6. These choices reduce ordering given large in-transit while reflecting the sustained lower-demand regime and confirmed lead time.

Promised L=2 matches observed lead time; no sustained demand regime shift detected (historic weekly samples mean ~352). To be conservative given delayed visible arrivals and substantial pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base stock from the full historical sample set; this avoids overreacting to transient zeros and lets the backend cap orders using its cap formula. Defaults balance service level vs holding cost under confirmed LT=2 and existing pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=861. Historical sample mean (provided) ~364.4/week; promised lead time=2 and actual lead time has been confirmed at 2 in prior concludes. Pipeline (861) is significant but likely below (1+L)*mean_all = 3*364.4 \u22481093, so still short of covering review+lead demand if demand stays near historical average. I therefore use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean_all and matching sigma from all samples; this balances service vs holding given no new sustained regime change evidence.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=861. Historical conclude messages show observed lead times = 2 (orders from P2->P4 and P8->P10), no evidence of lost shipments or longer lead time. Pipeline is substantial (861) so we should trust observed lead time. Choose L='calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) using the engine's z* formula while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy periods.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent concluded history shows observed lead time = 2 (confirmed P2\u2192P4 and P8\u2192P10). On-hand=0, in-transit=861. Historical weekly demand samples (given) have mean \u2248352.4; with promised L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods so default backlog-adjusted demand \u22481057. In-transit (861) is below that forecast \u2192 risk of stockout if no additional arrivals. I use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this leverages full history while allowing the OR capped order rule to size the actual order given pipeline. This balances service (avoid stockouts) vs holding cost given moderate holding cost relative to profit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent observed weekly demand has fallen sharply vs. historical Jan samples: recent concluded demands (P8-P14) = [141,88,62,48,64,62,69] (mean \u2248 80.7) vs. historical sample mean 352.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=861 (large pipeline). Lead time evidence (concluded messages) consistently shows 2 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 2). To reflect the clear, sustained lower-demand regime since April, I use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most recent 7 demand observations. This reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding given the large in-transit volume and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent weekly demand has been low (last 6 weeks: 48,64,62,69,49,62 earlier) compared with the Jan historical samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=861 (large pipeline). Period 7 confirmed actual lead time = 2. To avoid overordering given a large in-transit pipeline and confirmed lead time, use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine applies the long-run sample mean (which smooths the early high-Jan samples) while capping orders via its cap logic. This balances service with holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has been low and stable over the last ~6 periods (P11-P16 demands = 48,64,62,69,49,36; mean \u2248 54.7). On-hand=0 but large pipeline in-transit=861 units which comfortably covers (1+L) review+lead demand. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 periods; no evidence of new lead-time or seasonal regime shifts. I therefore keep L at the default (promised) value and use recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases forecast and volatility on the most recent regime while avoiding overreacting to older data. No new sustained patterns to carry forward.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=861 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent low weekly demand (recent demands trending 22\u201369 units/week). Promised lead time=2 and historical conclude messages confirm 2-period arrivals; I keep L as default to match promise. Given large pipeline, use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so OR backend applies its base-stock cap and prevents over-ordering while respecting service level tradeoff (profit $4 vs holding $1). This keeps ordering conservative given ample in-transit stock and declining recent demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent realized demand since stockouts (Periods 11-18) is low and stable (48,64,62,69,49,36,22,24 \u2192 mean \u224847.5), suggesting a lower demand regime versus the early-season peak. On-hand is 0 and large in-transit = 861 units (covers many periods). Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods (Period 7 evidence), so use promised/default L to keep OR engine aligned. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (captures last 8 realized demands). These settings reduce target base-stock relative to early high-season levels and let the OR engine consider the large pipeline; they balance service level (by using recent demand mean over the review+lead period) against holding cost given the sizable in-transit inventory.

No recent sustained changepoint in demand or lead time beyond previously confirmed LT=2. Use default (promised) lead time and default demand stats so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this lets the OR engine set base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost given established historical stats.

No new sustained lead-time or demand regime change detected. Use default promised L so OR backend assumes promised lead time=2; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, allowing it to cap orders against pipeline and avoid overordering given the large in-transit inventory.

Pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demands (many single-digit/low tens weeks with a recent spike of 121 in P21), so use default statistical estimates to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap using full-sample mean/variance.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Prior evidence (Period 7) confirmed actual lead time=2. To capture the recent demand regime without overfitting to just two points, I use a recent sample window of 5 for demand mean and volatility so the forecast reflects the emerging increase while retaining some smoothing. Use default (promised) lead time to match confirmed observations and avoid overreacting to possible delivery anomalies. These choices bias orders upward enough to cover (1+L) demand under the new higher short-term demand while the large in-transit stock limits aggressive atop-up.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=861. Recent demand shows a sustained uptick in Periods 21-23 (121,122,137) after a prolonged low regime; I therefore use a recent-window forecast to capture the new regime. L set to 'calculate' to use observed lead-time evidence (arrivals show 2 periods). mu_hat set to recent_N (N=3) to base the (1+L)*mean forecast on the three most recent high-demand weeks. sigma_hat set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts for the new higher demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21-23: avg increased from ~26.8 (Periods 17-20) to 126.7 (Periods 21-23), +~374%; sustained for 3 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand spike observed in Periods 21-23 (avg ~127 over 3 periods) but Period 24 fell to 76; on-hand=0, in-transit=861. Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods and promised lead time is 2, so use default promised L to keep OR engine expectations aligned. To capture the recent high-demand regime while remaining responsive to short window changes, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures Periods 21-23 spike). This will raise the base-stock to cover the recent surge while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock for higher variability. The large in-transit (861) will be reconciled by the OR engine cap; using recent_N focuses ordering on recent realized demand rather than long-ago low-demand history.

On-hand=0, in-transit=861 units \u2014 ample pipeline to cover upcoming (1+L) periods at the elevated demand. Use promised lead time to remain consistent with supplier contract and past confirmation. Set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the new regime (captures mean at current level). Use recent 5-week volatility to reflect current variability. This balances service (meeting the sustained higher demand) while avoiding excess hold since large in-transit position already exists.

I keep L as promised (default) since observed lead-time was previously confirmed =2 and no new contrary conclude messages.

These choices focus the base-stock on the sustained higher-demand regime while using pipeline stock to avoid over-ordering given substantial in-transit volume.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand shows a sustained high regime since Period 21 (periods 21-27: 121,122,137,76,140,180,184) vs ~22-36 earlier. On-hand=0, in-transit=861 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = 2 (P2->P4, P8->P10). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (avg=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 21-27). For sigma I also use recent_N N=7 to reflect volatility in the recent regime. These choices bias base stock toward the recent higher demand while using observed lead time to avoid underordering given the large but delayed pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=861 \u2014 large pipeline present, no immediate arrivals visible yet. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 2-period actual lead time; use promised lead time. Demand has shifted up starting Period 21 and sustained; use recent data from that high-demand regime (Periods 21\u201328, 8 samples) to set forecast and volatility so orders match current demand level while capping by OR backend. Methods chosen: L=default to rely on promised lead time (supported by past confirmations), mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-changepoint higher mean over the last 8 periods, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service needs after the sustained uplift while the backend cap will limit excessive ordering given large in-transit inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has clearly shifted up starting Periods 21-23 and remained high through Period 29 (weekly demands 121,122,137,76,140,180,184,272,215). On-hand=0, in-transit=861 (undelivered but not yet concluded). I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded arrivals still support lead time=2 (no new concluded evidence of change). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 21-29) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 9 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 9 samples). These parameters focus the OR engine on the confirmed higher-demand regime while not overreacting to single-week spikes; using recent_N concentrates stock to meet elevated demand while the backend cap limits excessive orders given pipeline inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime since Periods 21-30 (weekly demands: 121,122,137,76,140,180,184,272,215,300) \u2014 sustained high demand for ~10 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=861 (pipeline covers several weeks). Lead-time evidence from concluded history (P4 and P10 arrivals for P2 and P8 orders) consistently shows 2 periods. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=2. I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (uses the last 10 demand samples), so the OR backend builds a base-stock appropriate for the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the sustained surge) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent demand has been much higher since Periods 21-31 (weekly demands: 121,122,137,76,140,180,184,272,215,300,240) \u2014 sustained elevated regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=861 units (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 and previously confirmed as 2. I set L=default to use promised lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime, I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 21-31) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the most relevant recent data. This balances service (by reflecting the elevated recent mean and volatility) against holding cost given the already-large in-transit volume.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Recent demand has stepped up sharply starting Period 21 (sustained high weekly demand through Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=861 which should cover several upcoming periods given the higher demand; no new concluded arrivals indicate no further lead-time change. Lead time: use promised lead time (default=2) because lead time was previously confirmed as 2 and no sustained deviation observed. Demand forecast: use recent regime average to capture the sustained demand increase since Period 21; choose recent_N with N=13 (Periods 21-33 window length = 13 weeks of the new regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 13 samples. Volatility: use recent_N with N=13 to capture current variability. These choices raise target base-stock to meet elevated demand while relying on in-transit volume to avoid immediate over-ordering, balancing service level (profit) vs holding cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019/09/30). Recent demand has been materially higher since the regime shift noted in Periods 21-23 and has remained elevated through Period 33 (including very large weekly volumes up to 704). On-hand=0, in-transit=861 \u2014 sizable pipeline exists but recent conclude history shows no new arrivals since P10, so some in-transit may be delayed; however no concluded lead-time change is confirmed. I retain the promised lead time (default) for L. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (most recent 13 weeks: Periods 21\u201333) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the current elevated regime and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=4, holding=1.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. On-hand=0, in-transit=917 (large pipeline but many past promised arrivals have not concluded -> possible lost/delayed shipments). Historical concludes confirm lead time=2 earlier (Period 7) and no sustained new evidence to change it. Demand has clearly shifted up since Periods 21-23; to capture the new higher regime I use a recent-window forecast. I set L to default (promised 2) to let the OR engine use contractual lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N to focus on the recent high-demand regime (N=13 covers Periods ~22-34). This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost by concentrating the forecast on the sustained higher-demand window while leaving lead time at promised to avoid overcompensating for missing shipment noise.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 21 (weekly demands jumped from ~20s to large 3-digit values) and high weekly demand continuing through Period 35 (several weeks >200, one week 704). On-hand=0, in-transit=985 (sizable pipeline). Earlier concluded evidence confirms actual lead time = 2 (Period 4 and 10 arrivals). I use default lead time (promised=2) since concluded arrivals support it. For demand I target the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 21\u201335, regime_length=15) so mu_hat reflects current high demand. I also set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=15 to capture current volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned to the sustained high-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline will be considered by the OR engine when computing final order (min(base_stock\u2212pipeline, cap)), avoiding excessive new orders given 985 units already inbound.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. Demand has been substantially higher since Periods 21-36 (sustained spike noted earlier). Observed lead times from concluded messages: P4 (order P2) = 2, P10 (order P8) = 2, P36 (order P35) = 1 \u2192 average \u2248 1.67. To account for actual lead-time variability I request the backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). To bias forecasts toward the recent high-demand regime, use recent_N=15 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the post-shift elevated mean and volatility while staying within the 20-cap rule). These choices help the OR backend raise base-stock for the sustained higher demand while letting observed lead-time data adjust L for delayed/shorter arrivals.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been substantially higher and volatile since the mid-year regime shift (Periods 21-33+) with very large weekly peaks (e.g. P33=704, P34-37 397/250/197/310). On-hand=0, in-transit=958 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: P2->P4=2, P8->P10=2, P35->P36=1 (avg=1.667). To reflect actual observations while letting the OR engine use its promised-L assumptions, I set L via calculate (average observed lead time). For demand forecast I focus on the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=10 to capture the elevated mean/volatility over the last ~10 periods without overfitting single spikes. Sigma set recent_N N=10 to reflect recent realized volatility. Given the large in-transit position (958), these parameters avoid further aggressive topping while aligning safety stock to recent higher demand and inferred slightly-shorter-than-promised lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime since Periods 21-23 and remained elevated through Period 38 (many weekly demands >> pre-shift). Pipeline is large (in-transit=1123, on-hand=0) from recent orders; some arrivals have shown lead_time=1 recently while earlier arrivals showed lead_time=2. To balance service vs holding cost: I estimate lead time from recent observed arrivals (captures recent faster deliveries) using recent_N over the last 4 observed lead times. For demand I use a recent_N window covering the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 21 onward) to forecast (1+L)-period demand and reduce stockouts given the higher level. Volatility also uses the same recent_N window to reflect current variability. These choices rely on concluded arrival evidence and the documented demand regime shift and aim to avoid underordering given elevated demand while the large in-transit balance limits aggressive additional buys.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since late Aug/Sept (many weeks with 200+ and spikes to 700). On-hand=0, in-transit=1123 which already covers multiple future periods; promised lead time is 2. I use L=default to trust the promised 2-period setting (historical concludes show mostly 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to focus the forecast on the recent high-demand regime (captures last 12 weeks of elevated demand) so the backend base_stock scales to current demand; sigma left as default so variability is estimated from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts given large recent demand) versus holding cost (pipeline already large).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=1148. Historical demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 21 (Periods 21-40: elevated weekly demand vs earlier low regime). No new sustained lead-time evidence since prior confirmation of LT=2 (Period 7). To capture the sustained higher demand regime, set L to promised (default) and compute demand over the recent high-demand regime using recent_N (N=20, covering Periods 21-40). Use matching recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) review+lead demand under the current high-demand regime while the large in-transit volume is recognized by OR pipeline logic.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1148 which is sizable relative to recent elevated demand. Historical data shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 21 (confirmed in carry-over). Lead time has varied historically but promised lead time is 2; no new sustained lead-time change in concluded messages since prior confirmation. To respect promised lead time and capture the sustained high-demand regime, I set L=default (use promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (most recent 20 periods cover the elevated demand pattern). Use the same recent_N (N=20) for sigma to estimate volatility from the same window. This balances high service target (profit/holding -> q=0.8) with current pipeline: large in-transit reduces need for excessive new orders but higher recent mean justifies maintaining elevated base stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent weeks (Periods ~30-42) show a sustained high-demand regime (many weekly demands 200\u2013700+) compared with earlier low regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=1148 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are delayed by promised lead time. I keep L as default (promised=2) because concluded messages historically show mostly 2 and no new sustained lead-time change. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the current high-demand regime (recent 12 weeks balances responsiveness and noise). For sigma I use recent_N N=12 to match the volatility estimate to the same recent window. These parameters bias orders toward the current high-demand regime while the OR engine's capped policy will limit extreme replenishment given the pipeline, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Demand has shifted up substantially since mid-2019 and recent weeks show much higher, more volatile demand; use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the most recent regime and volatility while the large in-transit pipeline limits immediate ordering pressure.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=1224. Historical concluded lead times (last observed): 2,2,1,1,3 \u2192 recent average ~1.8; lead time has fluctuated around the promised 2. Demand shows a sustained high regime since Period 21 (large weekly demands through Sep\u2013Dec). To respect recent lead-time variability while leaning on most recent signals, I set L=recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 observed lead times). Demand forecast should reflect the high recent weekly demand, so mu_hat uses recent_N N=5 (captures last 5 demands). Volatility also driven by recent spikes (e.g., 598), so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5. These choices make the OR backend size base-stock and cap using the most recent regime and recent lead-time behavior, balancing service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and high recent demand) against holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since mid-2019 (sustained large weekly sales through Sep\u2013Dec) and year-end/holiday season likely elevates demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=1123 (large pipeline covering many weeks). Observed lead times vary (1\u20133 periods); I use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand I focus on the recent high-demand regime to avoid being understocked: use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the recent elevated mean/variance. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory already present.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile since the regime shift first noted at P21-23; last 20 periods (P27-46) show a mean ~281 units/week and high variance. On-hand=0, in-transit=1123 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2,2,1,1,3,2 \u2192 average ~1.83. To capture current high demand while reflecting recent variability and the mixed lead-time evidence, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will use the sample average). For demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to anchor forecasts on the most relevant high-demand regime (gives (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std), while the large existing in-transit pipeline reduces need for aggressive new orders. This balances service (capture elevated demand) against holding cost and potential delayed/lost shipments.
