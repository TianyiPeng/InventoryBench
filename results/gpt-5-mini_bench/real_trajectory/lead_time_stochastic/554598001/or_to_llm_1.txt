No calendar/seasonal spike upcoming (Period date 2019-02-11). With no evidence of lead-time shortening or lost shipments and holding cost high relative to profit ($1 holding vs $4 profit), I prefer to be conservative to avoid excess holding. Therefore I scale OR's capped recommendation down by ~18% to reflect the recent downward demand shift while still providing inventory to serve multiple periods. Final order = 65 units (round number). This keeps more stock-light posture while still provisioning some pipeline for the next L+1 periods given reduced demand outlook.\nDecision summary: follow OR logic but reduce quantity because recent demand has fallen ~19% relative to OR's sample mean and there is no evidence requiring aggressive restocking.",

Do NOT treat absent concludes as lost yet. Step 2 \u2014 Demand estimate (use historical samples provided): single-period mean \u03bc\u0304 = (78+58+47+42+40)/5 = 53. Sample std dev \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 15.62. For review+lead (1+L=3): \u03bc\u0302 = 3\xd753 = 159; \u03c3\u0302 = \u221a3\xd715.62 \u2248 27.05.

Step 4 \u2014 Judgmental adjustments: There was one large observed demand (120) in Period 2, but it was unmet (sold=0) so not yet evidence of sustained regime change. Given large pipeline (159) already close to base_stock (182) and holding cost $1/unit/period, minimizing excess holding is prudent. Therefore I reduce the OR recommendation (69) to the base-stock implied replenishment (~23 units) to top up pipeline toward the target while avoiding excess holding. Step 5 \u2014 Action: order 23 units for SKU 554598001.
