Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent observed demand samples (5 weekly points from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~53. No prior arrivals or concluded messages exist, so actual lead time cannot be inferred; promised lead time (2) is used. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we need to replenish to cover (1+L) periods of demand. Using default methods lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to balance service level (via profit/holding ratio) against holding cost given limited data and no evidence of regime change or lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent historical weekly mean demand \u224853 units (samples: 78,58,47,42,40). On-hand=0, in-transit=79 (order placed Period 1 not yet observed as arrived in any conclude message). Promised lead time=2 and there is no sustained evidence of lead-time change or lost shipments (only one conclude showing arrived=0 for the Period 1 order). I therefore use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std formulas; this balances service level given the observed mean/variance while avoiding overreacting to a single missing arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=155 (orders placed earlier). Promised lead time is 2; no concluded arrivals observed yet so cannot confirm a lead-time change or lost shipments. Recent realized demand in Periods 1-2 (48, 120) shows variability but is not yet a sustained regime shift. Use default lead time (promised) so backend retains L=2 expectation. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all provided historical samples) to avoid overfitting to the two recent noisy demands and to balance profit vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent historical weekly demand samples: [78,58,47,42,40], mean \u224853. On-hand=0, in-transit=228 (sum of past orders 79+76+73). Period 1 order failed to conclude by its promised arrival but only a single confirmed miss exists \u2014 insufficient to declare a sustained lead-time change. To avoid overfitting to a possible lost shipment and to let the OR engine use promised lead time information, use default lead time and default demand estimates (which compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples). This keeps target base-stock sized to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand while the large in-transit balance already provides cushion versus near-term demand. Will monitor future conclude messages for confirmation of persistent delays before changing L.

Daily Reward (R_t): $119.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent history: one concluded arrival shows Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (observed lead time = 2, which matches promised L=2). On-hand=37, in-transit=155 (appears to be outstanding orders from Periods 1,3,4). Period 1 order non-arrival is concerning but not yet a sustained pattern. I therefore use the promised lead time to avoid overreacting. Set L=default to use promised 2-period lead time. Demand forecast uses all historical samples (stable weekly means: mean=53) so mu_hat=default to capture (1+L)\xd7overall mean and avoid overfitting short noisy fluctuations. Volatility also uses all samples (sigma_hat=default) to reflect observed variability. These choices balance service (using full-sample mean with L=2) while avoiding aggressive increases given potential lost/delayed shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent weekly demand (last 5 periods): [48,120,77,39,55], mean=67.8 units/week. Promised lead time is 2 and an observed arrival shows lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4), so use default promised L. On-hand=0, in-transit=185; (1+L)*mean \u2248 3*67.8=203.4 \u2192 pipeline slightly short of target coverage. To respond to recent demand regime and keep service while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current mean/volatility pattern while using default lead time handling.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=221. Recent observed lead times: P4 arrival (ordered P2) => 2; P6 arrival (ordered P5) => 1. Demand recent history (most relevant weeks): 120, 77, 39, 55, 47. To balance service vs holding cost and to adapt to recent demand regime, set L using recent average of the two observed lead times (captures recent faster arrivals but includes a 2-period event). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to focus forecast and volatility on the current demand regime and reduce influence of older Jan samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=251. Recent concluded lead times: 2 (P4 arrival for P2 order) and 1 (P6 arrival for P5 order) \u2014 mixed but limited sample. Demand history (concluded): 48,120,77,39,55,47,83 plus pre-game Jan samples. To adapt to recent demand variability while not overfitting the small lead-time sample, I set L using 'calculate' (avg of observed lead times). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to weight the most recent demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets base-stock responsive to recent demand swings and the capped order limit. This balances service (avoid stockouts given variable lead time) against holding cost by focusing on recent demand while letting the backend compute safety stock from profit/holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent realized demands (Periods 4-8): 39,55,47,83,55 (mean ~55.8). Observed concluded lead times: 2,1,2,1 (avg 1.5) \u2014 no sustained shift but recent variability exists. Current on-hand=41, in-transit=155, so pipeline is healthy; no obvious lost shipments. I set L using recent_N to let the backend average the last 4 observed lead times (captures the 1/2 alternation). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 (Periods 4-8) to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent regime (~56 units/week) so base_stock reflects current demand while avoiding overreaction to older samples. These choices balance service (maintain coverage for ~1.5\u20132 period lead) against holding cost given already-large pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand history (seed samples) mean = 53 units/week. I select L by averaging observed lead times so the OR backend uses empirical lead time (method: calculate). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this leverages all historical demand while letting backend apply the base-stock formula and cap to balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against current large pipeline (155) to avoid over-ordering given possible delayed arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=197. Historical demand samples mean=53 (samples: 78,58,47,42,40). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed lead times = [2,1,2,1], avg 1.5). Pipeline (197) already covers several periods of expected demand. To reflect observed lead-time variability while keeping demand forecast simple, set L by calculating the average observed lead time; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (accounts for longer realized lead times) with holding cost (pipeline is large), avoiding aggressive additional orders now.

Carry-over insight: Observed lead-time variability: lead times observed = [2,1,2,1] (Periods with concluded arrivals: P4, P6, P8), average lead time 1.5 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=207. Historical concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5) so I use recent lead-time averaging. Recent demand appears lower than early spikes; last 5 demand observations (Periods 7-11 = 83,55,28,43,41) show a stable, lower regime (mean ~50). To align the backend's (1+L) review+lead forecast with recent demand I set L via recent_N (N=4) and mu_hat/sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine targets service for the most recent regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit position.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent demand has stabilized around ~41\u201343 units/week (last three concluded demands: 43, 41, 41). Observed lead times in history show variability (recent observed lead times: 2,1,2,1; avg 1.5). On-hand=0 and in-transit=207 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent demand, so we should not inflate demand forecast. Set L to recent_N to reflect observed lead-time variability. For demand, use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current low/stable regime (mean \u224841.67) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean will be computed by backend. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to reflect reduced recent volatility. These choices balance service (using recent small mean) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline and lead-time uncertainty.

LLM Rationale:

Lead times observed recently = [2,1,2,1]; use recent average to capture current mix. Set L by averaging last 4 observed lead times to reflect observed 1.5-period behaviour. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 demand samples to respond to the lower recent regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias orders toward covering (1+L) periods of the lower recent demand while acknowledging lead-time variability and avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent realized weekly demand has been elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 43,41,41,31,67; mean ~44.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=197 so pipeline is large but arrival timing uncertain; observed lead times historically variable (seen 1 and 2). I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent 1/2 variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (higher recent mean). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce risk of over/under-ordering given uncertain arrival timing and current high in-transit quantity while providing a demand-driven base_stock.

Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=197 units (covers upcoming demand but arrivals have been variable). Recent concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2] (avg ~1.6) so I use a recent-average lead time. Recent demand shows no large sustained shift; last 5 realized weekly demands = [41,41,31,67,87], mean ~53.4. To reflect the most recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 so the OR backend sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current demand level while capturing recent volatility. This balances service (protecting against recent high weeks) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) = [2,1,2,1] (average 1.5). To balance service vs holding cost: (1) set L using recent observed lead times to reflect the faster-than-promised variability -> recent_N on last 4 observed lead times; (2) set mu_hat using recent demand (last 9 weekly samples) to capture the current higher-demand regime; (3) set sigma_hat using the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices ensure the backend base-stock reflects the current higher mean and variability while L captures the empirically observed shorter/mixed lead times; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=0, in-transit=199 units (large pipeline). Recent observed concluded lead times average ~1.5 periods (history P4,P6,P8,P11). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average. Demand has been consistently nonzero in the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 14-18: 67,87,51,35,43); I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. The large in-transit quantity plus recent demand-informed mu_hat will keep orders capped while avoiding excess ordering given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 (backend will compute service quantile).

Concluded lead-time observations average ~1.5 (Periods with arrivals show mix of 1 and 2). To balance higher recent demand and avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty, I set L=calculate (use observed average lead time), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to cover the elevated recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind; relying on recent samples mitigates bias from early-year lower demand and compensates for potential lost/delayed shipments by using observed lead-time in L.

Set L as recent_N N=4 to reflect observed average lead time ~1.5. Forecast demand across review+lead: (1+L)*mean \u2248 2.5*53 = 132.5, set explicitly to ensure backend orders enough given current high in-transit uncertainty. Volatility estimated explicitly at 24.7 to reflect sample std (\u224815.6) scaled by sqrt(1+L) (~1.58) => ~24.7.

Demand has risen sharply in recent weeks (last 5 demands = 35,43,92,131,142) indicating a higher-demand regime; use recent_N for demand and volatility to capture the new level and risk. Choices: L -> recent_N N=4 to reflect recent observed lead-time samples; mu_hat -> recent_N N=5 to base forecast on the last 5 periods which capture the spike; sigma_hat -> recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base stock to protect service during the apparent demand surge while the recent lead-time estimate moderates over-ordering given in-transit stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has risen sharply (last 5 weekly demands: 43, 92, 131, 142, 133) so I use a recent-window forecast. On-hand=0, in-transit=315 (sufficient pipeline but some past orders were delayed). Observed concluded lead times recently are mostly 2 (multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals), so I set L by averaging recent observed lead times. I select recent_N (N=5) for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent lead-time behavior; this biases orders toward meeting elevated demand while the OR backend will compute base_stock and cap accordingly. This choice balances service (higher recent mean) vs holding cost by relying on short recent history rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (evidence: orders P2->P4 lead=2, P6->P8 lead=2, P11->P13 lead=2, P20->P22 lead=2).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=270. Recent concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 2 periods in later history despite earlier variability; demand has stepped up markedly since mid-May/June (many weeks of 90-142 units). I set L explicit=2 to reflect confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last ~10 demand observations to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias base stock upward to avoid stockouts during sustained higher demand while keeping variance-based safety stock controlled to limit holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (evidence: P2->P4 lead=2, P6->P8 lead=2, P11->P13 lead=2, P20->P22 lead=2).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 20-24 demands = 131,142,133,141,146). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=339 units (covers multiple weeks). Historical concluded lead times consistently 2 periods recently; I'll use the promised/default lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 demand observations) so the OR engine sizes base-stock and cap to current elevated mean and volatility while respecting the pipeline cushion provided by the 339 in-transit units.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent weekly demand has shifted up markedly since late June: Periods 20-25 demands = [131,142,133,141,146,157] (avg\u2248141 over 6 weeks) versus early-sample mean ~53. On-hand=0, in-transit=426 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 periods consistently. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised 2) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 6-week regime (N=6). This gives the OR backend a forecast that reflects the new higher mean and recent volatility while the large in-transit will be reconciled by the engine when arrivals conclude; these parameters prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand period while limiting extra holding cost by using recent samples rather than the low historical mean.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Recent demand has stepped up in summer (Periods 22-26 demands = 133,141,146,157,136). Lead times historically 1-2 with many 2s, but a single 3-period arrival was observed (P23->P26) \u2014 not yet a sustained shift. To capture the recent higher demand regime while remaining responsive to lead-time variability, I use recent_N=5 for lead time, demand mean, and demand volatility so the OR backend bases base-stock and caps on the most recent 5 observations.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has risen substantially since Period ~20 (weekly demands: 131,142,133,141,146,157,136,118), on-hand=0, in-transit=355 (sizable pipeline but arrivals occur after decision). Historical concluded lead-times predominantly 2 periods; choose explicit L=2 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid understock from optimistic shorter LT. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 8 concluded demand samples) so base-stock and safety stock reflect elevated mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during sustained higher demand) versus holding cost by relying on recent regime rather than long-ago low demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has shifted to a much higher regime (many weeks of 100+ demand since Period 14) so I use recent data to forecast. On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times cluster around 2; using the most recent 5 observed lead times gives average \u22482, so I set L via recent_N=5. For demand I use recent_N=10 to capture the new high-demand regime ( (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples ), and sigma_hat also recent_N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend size base stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window using recent high-demand evidence while the sigma_recent lets safety stock respond to current variability; relying on recent lead-time avg (2) aligns expected arrivals with the large in-transit position and avoids underordering given sustained high demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has stepped up sharply since Period 20 (demands: P20..P29 = [131,142,133,141,146,157,136,118,163,180], avg\u2248144). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover multiple future periods given lead time ~2, but we must forecast on the new high-demand regime. Lead time: use calculate (backend average of observed lead times) since concluded arrivals consistently support a 2-period lead time overall. Demand mean/variance: use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained regime shift starting at Period 20 (regime length=10). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat aligns the base-stock to current higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N reflects elevated volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts under the new demand) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent weeks show high demand (P26-30: 136,118,163,180,114) vs earlier low seed samples \u2014 a clear regime of elevated demand. On-hand=35 and in-transit=312 provides large pipeline cover; some prior shipments had variable lead-times but carry-over already confirmed LT=2. I set L to default (promised 2) to align with contract and OR expectations. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime (uses P26-30), and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward to protect service during sustained high demand while sigma from recent data informs safety stock sizing; using recent_N avoids diluting the forecast with the much lower early-season samples.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Promised lead time=2 and prior concludes consistently confirm 2-period lead time, so use default L. For demand I detect a sustained high-demand regime starting ~Period 20 (12 periods of high demand); use recent_N N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean and volatility across the review+lead horizon. This balances service (higher m\xfb to avoid stockouts in current high-demand regime) against holding cost given sizeable in-transit inventory.

Recent demand is elevated versus earliest samples, but no new sustained changepoint meeting 3+ period threshold that isn't already recorded, so use default forecasting (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps parameters simple, leverages large pipeline, and lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given Profit=$4, Holding=$1.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded lead times cluster at 2 periods. To protect service during the elevated recent-demand regime while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time and base stock computed from a recent-demand mean and volatility estimate over the latest regime. Chosen: L=default (promised 2). mu_hat: recent_N=12 to capture the higher recent mean demand (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 12 samples). sigma_hat: recent_N=12 to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base stock to meet current higher demand while keeping sigma informed by recent variability and leveraging in-transit stock.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has been high and volatile (Periods 30-34 demands = 114,87,103,112,83; recent mean \u2248100). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (large pipeline that will cover multiple periods, some shipments previously showed variable lead times but carry-over confirms promised lead time=2 historically). I set L to default (promised 2) because concluded history supports lead_time=2 overall and backend expects promised LT. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent elevated demand regime (covers last 5 concluded demand periods). I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since ~Period 25 (many weekly demands in 130-180 range) and intermittent lead-time variability (observed leads: mix of 1-3, so use empirical average). Set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to focus forecast/volatility on the recent high-demand regime (captures weeks 28-35 demand behavior) so base-stock rises to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma uses recent variability to size safety stock and avoid excess holding given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting ~Period 25: avg demand before P25 ~54 (samples P1-P24), avg demand P25-P35 ~132 (+145%), sustained for 11 periods.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand regime is the higher level beginning ~Period 25 (sustained ~P25-P36). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Lead time historically confirms promised 2-periods; use promised/default lead time. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should use the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=12 (periods P25\u2013P36) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent high regime. This raises base-stock to meet the sustained demand spike while the large in-transit position helps cover immediate (L+1) periods and reduces need for extra cap-exceeding orders.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline); recent history shows sustained higher demand since ~Period 25 (avg ~132) and multiple confirmed 2-period lead-time observations. I set L=default to use the promised lead time=2 (consistent with confirmed evidence). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the post-change high-demand regime (Periods ~25-37) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent high-demand samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=13 to reflect volatility in the same regime. This biases orders upward to meet the sustained higher demand while accounting for current large in-transit stock to avoid excessive additional ordering.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent lead-time ~2 periods with occasional 3s/1s; average observed lead times supports using calculated average rather than promised to capture variability. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting ~Period 25 (pre-shift avg ~54, post-shift avg ~132); use a recent_N forecast covering the post-shift regime to size orders for the higher demand. Chosen methods: L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history average; mu_hat='recent_N' (N=14) to use (1+L)*mean of the last 14 demand samples (periods in the high-demand regime); sigma_hat='recent_N' (N=14) to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. This increases target base stock to reduce stockouts given high recent demand while keeping sigma aligned with recent variability to avoid excessive holding given $1 holding and $4 profit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Demand has been in the higher regime since ~Period 25 (sustained higher mean); on-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed leads = [2,1,2,1,2,2,1,3,2,3,2,1,3], avg\u22481.92). To capture the sustained post-change demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (N=15, periods 25\u201339). For lead time I use calculate (average of observed concluded lead times) so the OR backend adapts to actual lead-time behavior. Sigma uses recent_N (N=15) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (high profit vs holding cost) given large pipeline but elevated demand: higher mu_hat raises base-stock to avoid stockouts while sigma_hat reflects recent variability.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical carry-over shows a confirmed lead time = 2 periods and a past demand regime shift (Period25-35 avg ~132 vs prior ~54) but recent demand has softened (Periods36-40 demands = [80,88,49,61,28], recent mean ~61). With a large pipeline (423) and visible recent downward demand, use the promised lead time and base forecast on the most recent 5 periods to avoid overforecasting given current decay. Selected L=default to respect promised lead time=2; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 periods; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given sizable in-transit stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand regime since ~Period25 shows much higher demand (avg ~132) vs pre-P25 (~54); use recent data to capture this sustained shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline arriving per historical lead times). Lead time history shows variability but averages near 2 (observed sample avg \u22481.9), so set L to calculate (average observed lead times) to reflect true shipping behavior. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 25\u201341) to reflect the new high-demand regime; apply same recent_N=17 for sigma to capture elevated volatility. These choices push the OR backend to a higher base-stock to meet high recent demand while accounting for observed lead-time distribution and existing in-transit stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning ~Period 25 (avg ~132) vs ~54 earlier. On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (covers several future periods). Lead-time history repeatedly confirms ~2 periods. To target the elevated demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost, I keep promised lead time (default=2) and set demand estimates using the most recent regime data: use the last 18 samples (Period 25\u201342) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=18). This focuses the base-stock on the current high-demand level and captures recent volatility; keeping L=default prevents overreacting to past variability and leverages the in-transit pipeline to cover near-term demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Item 554598001 has On-hand=0, In-transit=423. Historical concluded lead times overwhelmingly center on 2 periods (multiple P->P+2 observations) and prior carry-over already confirmed lead time=2. Demand experienced a sustained higher regime beginning ~Period 25 (avg \u2248132) lasting ~11 periods; this is the most relevant demand regime for stocking to avoid large lost sales. I set L via calculate to let the backend use observed lead-time history (captures the confirmed 2-period reality). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to target the sustained high-demand regime (1+L scaling applied by backend). Volatility also uses recent_N N=11 to reflect variability during that high-demand regime. Given large in-transit (423 units) the OR engine's capped order will limit new orders; these parameters bias the base-stock toward the high-demand regime to restore service while the cap prevents excessive immediate receipts and holding cost burn.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded lead-time evidence is consistently 2 periods (multiple concluded orders P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13, P20->P22, etc.). Demand experienced a sustained high regime from ~P25\u2013P35 (avg ~132) lasting 11 periods; more recent periods (P36\u2013P44) show lower values but not a sustained new regime. To protect service given confirmed 2-period lead time and the prior sustained high-demand regime, set L to promised (default=2) and use recent_N over the documented high-demand regime (length 11) to capture that elevated demand in the (1+L) review+lead window. Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect volatility observed during that regime. This balances higher target inventory to avoid stockouts from the high-demand regime while acknowledging holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline arriving in future). Historical concluded lead times have been stable at 2 periods recently; demand spiked mid-year (Periods ~25-35) but has returned to a lower recent level. To avoid overstocking given the large in-transit quantity and current low recent demand, I set L to default (promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to focus the forecast on the last 10 concluded demand observations (Periods 36-45 mean demand \u224847.2) so the OR backend will size base_stock conservatively over the (1+L) review+lead horizon and reduce excess ordering risk. These choices balance service vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory and recent subdued demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent calendar period shows seasonally low weekly demand (Periods 36\u201346) despite an earlier sustained higher-demand regime from ~P25\u2013P35. On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 periods and recent concluded arrivals historically support L\u22482, so use default promised lead time to keep OR backend aligned with contract. To adapt forecast toward recent low December demand while still smoothing volatility, set mu_hat via EWMA (gamma=0.3) to weight recent observations moderately. Use sigma_hat based on recent_N (N=11) reflecting the recent 11-period low-demand regime to capture current variability. These choices keep orders responsive to the current low-season demand (reducing holding cost) while the large in-transit pipeline prevents stockouts in the immediate horizon.
