Reality check: demand shows a clear upward regime over the last three weeks (48, 72, 90; recent 3-week avg \u224870), ~54% above the long-run mean (45.4). With zero on-hand/pipeline and uncertainty about whether the upward trend persists, I increase the order above OR\u2019s capped 107 but avoid matching the uncapped base stock (190) to limit holding risk. Final decision: order 130 units to better cover a 3-period demand if the recent higher-level (\u224870/week) persists while limiting excess inventory if the spike moderates. This balances higher expected sales (profit $4) against $1 holding cost and lead-time uncertainty.

Strategy: place an order to top up pipeline toward the base-stock target while acknowledging possible further delays; round to a practical integer.

Pipeline is partially unreliable because Period1 order (130) remains unconfirmed/overdue despite in-transit showing 260 (likely includes the overdue 130 and the recent Period4 130). Demand outlook: recent realized weekly demand is high and elevated vs earlier (Period2=128, P3=123, P4=75; recent 3-week average \u2248108.7 units/week). Policy: with L=2 we should cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand. Estimated 3-week demand \u2248 326 units. Current visible on-hand + reliable pipeline is 30 on-hand + likely reliable portion of in-transit (at least 130 from Period4), but because the Period1 130 is overdue and may be lost, I treat only 130 of the 260 in-transit as reliable and conservatively assume the other 130 may not arrive. That yields effective pipeline \u2248160 (30 + 130). Required order \u2248 326 \u2212 160 = 166. To limit holding cost and because of uncertainty about lost shipments, I scale down toward a conservative interim replenishment to reduce stockout risk but avoid large overstock: order 100 units now. This increases available inventory when arrivals occur (some arriving after 2 periods) while limiting downside if overdue 130 later shows up.
