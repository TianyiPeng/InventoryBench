Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward shift: samples 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 = 48,72,90. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so need to replenish to cover review+lead periods. Use promised lead time (default) L=2 because no arrival history to contradict promised lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (weeks 2019-01-21..2019-02-04) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3). For sigma_hat use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility in the higher-demand regime. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts during the sustained demand increase while keeping volatility-based safety stock limited to recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior early-period mean (2019-01-07..2019-01-14) = 8.5 vs recent mean (2019-01-21..2019-02-04) = 70 (+724%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand samples show a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (means jumped from ~8.5 to ~70) already recorded. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=105 (order placed P1). No concluded arrivals yet beyond the P1 conclude (arrived=0) so actual lead time is unconfirmed; shipments may still be in transit. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=2) to avoid premature adjustments. For demand and volatility I use defaults so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), leveraging the full sample set (which includes the confirmed post-2019-01-21 higher-demand regime) to size orders that balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent mean across 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 = 70 vs prior 8.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=197; no concluded arrivals yet so cannot confirm lead-time deviation\u2014use promised lead time. Set L=default. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecasts on the 3-period high-demand regime (2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and variability to prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while the backend caps orders via its cap formula to limit excess inventory and holding costs.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand regime (from 2019-01-21) is higher and sustained: recent sample mean ~70 (3 most recent weeks). All three recent orders have not concluded (arrived=0), leaving 330 units in-transit and signaling shipments are delayed/lost vs. promised. To avoid underordering given elevated demand and uncertain actual lead time, set lead time explicit longer than promised. Use recent_N=3 for demand mean/volatility to capture the confirmed higher regime (3-sample regime). These choices raise the backend base-stock to cover the higher demand while acknowledging delayed arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (recent samples: 48,72,90; mean=70). Observed concluded lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4), matching promised lead time. Current on-hand=17 and in-transit=400 \u2014 ample pipeline but some earlier orders (Period1, Period3) not yet concluded; however one confirmed LT=2 gives confidence. Set L by calculating from observed lead times to confirm promised LT. For demand, use recent_N=3 to capture the higher recent mean (regime shift) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward service (higher mean) while relying on observed LT to avoid over-ordering.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (higher mean ~70) already recorded. On-hand=0, in-transit=400 (some arrivals have concluded; one concluded arrival shows actual lead time=2 matching promised). I choose default lead time to trust promised L=2. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (uses full historical mean ~45.4/week -> scaled for review+lead window) so the OR engine will target a base stock reflecting the elevated regime while keeping computations consistent with observed lead-time reliability. This balances service (higher mu_hat covers the recent higher demand) versus holding cost by leveraging the backend's capped order cap.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand has been high and volatile (period demands: 67,128,123,75,74,82 plus historical Jan samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=400 (pipeline large). Observed concluded lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). No sustained lead-time change yet. I set L by averaging observed lead times to let backend confirm actual lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (last 6 samples) to capture the new higher regime while limiting influence of older low-demand weeks. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices steer the OR engine toward a base-stock sized for the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits additional ordering to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has been in the higher regime (periods show sustained ~75-123 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=400 (some earlier orders may be delayed but only one concluded arrival shows lead_time=2). I keep L tied to the promised lead time to avoid overreacting to limited lead-time evidence. For demand I use a recent_N window (last 5 weeks: P3-P7) to capture the sustained higher regime; backend will scale by (1+L). Sigma uses the same recent_N to reflect recent volatility. These parameters aim to replenish for the higher sustained demand while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=400, recent concluded arrivals show one observed lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Demand regime shifted up starting 2019-01-21 (samples: 48,72,90 \u2192 mean 70) and has been sustained. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm average observed lead time (uses concluded lead_time=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the confirmed higher regime (uses last 3 high-demand samples). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise base_stock to cover the sustained higher demand while keeping hold cost sensitivity via the backend cap.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent realized weekly demand has been high vs early-period (Periods 4-9 demands = [75,74,82,75,92,39], recent mean ~73), consistent with the previously recorded regime shift starting 2019-01-21. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 400 (pipeline provides cover but some earlier orders never concluded). Observed concluded arrival (Period 4 conclude) shows a lead time of 2 for the order placed in Period 2, supporting the promised 2-period lead time. To target profit-driven service level (q = profit/(profit+holding)=4/(4+1)=0.8) while avoiding excess holding cost, I set L using calculated observed lead times, and use a recent_N forecast (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime reflected in the last 6 demand observations. These parameters will raise base_stock to meet the elevated demand pattern while sigma_hat from recent data captures current volatility and avoids over/under-stocking from stale early samples.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): recent on-hand=0, in-transit=400. Historical sample set shows a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (higher mean). Lead time has been observed as 2 periods (concluded evidence). To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time I select L by calculation (reflecting observed average). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the post-changepoint higher mean from the available samples and scale by (1+L). Volatility left to default so OR uses all-sample std scaled for (1+L). This balances higher service level for confirmed higher demand while avoiding excessive extra safety stock beyond the backend cap; existing in-transit (400) will be counted by the engine when computing pipeline coverage.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has moderated from the early high regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 7-11) = [75,92,39,31,48], mean ~57. On-hand=0, in-transit=400 (sizable pipeline). Previously confirmed lead time=2. I use default promised L=2 to keep consistency with confirmations and the OR engine. I forecast demand using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (reduces weight of the early Jan spike) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5). I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with recent demand while the large in-transit quantity reduces need for aggressive additional ordering, balancing service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=400. Historical demand samples (weeks in snapshot) show elevated regime since 2019-01-21; prior carry-over confirmed actual lead time=2. I choose L as default (use promised lead time=2) and use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This leverages the confirmed lead time and full-sample statistics; current in-transit (400 units) materially exceeds the (1+L)-period demand estimate, so policy will cap ordering to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service level.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=0, in-transit=400. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime starting 2019-01-21; recent weekly demand remains elevated (many weeks of 30\u201390). Promised lead time is 2 and prior concluded evidence confirmed L=2. I choose L=default to use promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent elevated weekly demand average across the latest regime while avoiding dilution by very old low samples. I keep sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by review+lead period. This combination raises target base-stock to preserve service (profit>holding) while limiting excess inventory given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent demand has settled lower vs the early post-Jan spike: last 6 concluded demands (Periods 9-14) = [39,31,48,43,28,32], mean \u2248 36.8, a sustained lower regime for 6 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=400 \u2014 with promised lead time=2 (confirmed historically) the pipeline (400) already comfortably covers (1+L)=3 periods at the recent demand level (~110 units). I therefore set L to the default (use promised lead time=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (avoiding upward bias from the Jan spike). For volatility I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent observed spread. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the current lower-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline and nontrivial holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=400 (sizable pipeline). Prior carry-over confirms demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (sustained) and lead time observed=2. Use L default (promised 2; confirmed by history) so backend uses promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 5\u201315) to reflect the sustained higher post-changepoint regime; (1+L)\xd7mean over these 11 recent samples better captures current demand than the older pre-change samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to measure volatility from the same recent window. These parameters prioritize meeting elevated demand while the large in-transit quantity reduces urgent over-ordering risk.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=400. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (higher baseline vs early Jan). Recent weeks (last ~6 concluded periods) show moderate, stable weekly demand (mid-20s to low-40s). I therefore retain the promised lead time (default=2) and set demand forecast using recent_N (last 6 weeks) to capture the current regime and avoid overweighting the early-Jan samples. sigma_hat uses the same recent_N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a base stock sized for the (1+L) review+lead window under the current demand regime while limiting excess holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand regime (noted earlier) is higher than initial two-sample mean and has been sustained; on-hand=0, in-transit=400 which likely covers multiple review+lead periods so no immediate extra risk of stockout. Promised lead time=2 confirmed historically; use default L. For demand I use recent_N to focus the OR forecast on the post-changepoint demand regime (use all recent 14 samples since arrivals resumed) so mu_hat reflects current average demand over (1+L) periods. Volatility also set via recent_N (same N=14) to capture recent demand variability. These choices bias the base-stock toward observed recent demand while letting the backend cap orders to avoid excess holding given holding cost = $1 vs profit $4.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=0, in-transit=400; promised lead time=2 and prior concluded evidence (Period 4) confirmed 2. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 9\u201318) averages ~32.6 units/week, lower than the earlier Jan spike. To size the (review+lead) forecast I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the sustained lower demand regime (last 10 periods). I keep L as default (promised=2) because lead time was previously confirmed and no new late-arrival evidence exists. Using recent_N for mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 samples to reflect current demand, while sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) captures recent volatility. This balances service (cover ~3 weeks of current demand) versus holding cost given holding $1 vs profit $4.

To avoid excess holding given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, set lead time from observed data and forecast using the most recent 5-period regime so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. Recent demand has been in a lower summer regime (many weeks since March with demands mostly 12\u201332). On-hand=0, in-transit=400 (covers several weeks of current low demand). Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods; will use promised lead time. To align orders with recent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the estimator on the most recent low-demand samples (regime length ~16 periods since the post-peak decline). This reduces over-ordering versus using the high early-year peak samples and helps the OR backend trade off the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost under current low seasonality.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (Periods 13\u201321: 28,32,26,25,30,24,15,12,17), well below the earlier Jan spike; on-hand=0, in-transit=400 (large pipeline arriving later). Use promised lead time since historical concludes confirm LT=2 previously and no new LT evidence. Use recent_N for demand parameters to reflect the current low-demand regime (capture last 9 weeks of stable data) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to avoid excess holding while maintaining service from the large in-transit.

Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I set L to default (promised 2) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 weeks, reducing excess stock while preserving service given the 400 units already in transit.

Period=2019-07-22. Recent weekly demand has settled well below the Feb spike (many weeks of 12\u201332 units since Apr); on-hand=0, in-transit=400 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and prior conclude messages confirm 2, so use default L to keep model aligned with supplier promise. To reflect the post-spike lower summer demand (changepoint from high Feb levels to sustained lower Apr\u2013Jul levels), forecast demand using recent data: use recent_N for mu_hat (captures current regime) and recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. The large in-transit position means orders will be capped by pipeline; these parameter choices lower the target base stock to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service for the current lower-demand regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=400. Historical demand has settled at a lower summer regime vs. the Jan spike; last 5 concluded weekly demands (Periods 20-24) = [12,17,32,20,17], showing a recent mean ~19.6/week. Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods; use the promised/default L so backend keeps that. To target service while limiting holding cost, set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 weeks (captures current summer regime). Methods: L=default to use promised 2; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect (1+L)-period demand under current regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent variability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. Recent demand (Periods 13\u201325) is low and stable compared with the Feb spike; on-hand=0, in-transit=400 (pipeline large). Lead time has been previously confirmed as 2 periods; use promised/default lead time. Set L to default to keep consistency with supplier promise. Use recent_N for demand parameters to capture the current low-demand regime (use last 13 samples: Periods 13\u201325) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current mean/volatility and avoid overstocking given holding cost >0. This balances service level (use pipeline) vs. holding cost by forecasting based on the recent regime rather than the earlier high-demand spike.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=400, promised L=2 (lead time previously confirmed as 2). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 6\u201326) is much lower than the Jan spike; demand has stabilized in the low-to-mid tens. To reflect the recent lower regime and limit excess holding, keep L as default (promised=2) and set demand parameters using recent_N (N=20) to capture the last ~20 weeks of observed demand and recent volatility. This biases orders toward current run-rate while the large in-transit position (400) will be reconciled by the OR engine. Recent_N helps the backend balance service (using recent mean) versus holding cost (reduces overweighting of the Jan spike).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. On-hand=0, in-transit=400 which currently provides a multi-period buffer. Historical concluded lead-time evidence (Period 4: order on P2 arrived P4) confirms actual lead time = 2. Demand has been lower/moderate since the large Jan spike; recent weeks (last ~12 periods) show mean demand around mid-20s. I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded evidence matches promised and there are no recent lost shipments. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the current post-spike regime and recent volatility; using recent data reduces risk of overstocking from the Jan spike. These parameters let the OR backend size base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand with recent mean and scale safety stock by observed recent volatility, balancing service-level against $1 holding cost versus $4 profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-08-26. Recent observed weekly demand (Periods 21-28) = [17,32,20,17,11,27,56,52], mean=29.0. On-hand=0, in-transit=400 (covers >> (1+L)*mean), prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2. I choose L=default (promised 2). I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to capture the current mid-year demand regime (1+L=3 => backend will compute mu_hat=3*mean of last 8). I use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned with recent demand while OR cap will limit orders given large in-transit inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand (Periods 22-29 = [32,20,17,11,27,56,52,32]) shows moderate, slightly variable weekly demand with no new sustained regime shift beyond the previously recorded Feb spike. On-hand=0, in-transit=400 (pipeline large vs current weekly demand). Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods; use promised/default to keep OR backend assumptions aligned. Forecast demand using recent 8 weeks to reflect current seasonality and variance. Therefore: L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent demand regime, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 for matching volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to current demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits new ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=400. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (recorded earlier) so use promised/default L. Recent demand has rebounded; last 5 period demands = [27,56,52,32,80], mean=49.4. To capture current regime I set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 (review+lead multiplier (1+L) applied by backend). Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (captures recent higher demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has been high (Periods 30-31: 80, 152) and on-hand is 0 with 400 units in-transit. Historical concluded lead-time evidence (recorded previously) supports L=2; there is no new sustained lead-time signal. I choose default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with the promised/confirmed 2-period lead. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples so the base-stock policy reflects long-run demand while the capped order cap moderates order size given the large in-transit pipeline. This avoids over-ordering on short-term spikes while allowing the OR engine to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has materially increased since ~Period 27 (2019-08-12) with last 6 periods demands = [56,52,32,80,152,153] indicating a new higher, volatile regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=400 (pipeline covers multiple periods). Promised lead time = 2 periods; prior carry-over confirmed LT=2. To focus the base-stock on the recent high demand regime, I set L to default (use promised 2), mu_hat to recent_N using the last 6 samples (captures new mean over the (1+L) review+lead window) and sigma_hat to recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to the confirmed lead time while raising forecast and safety stock to reduce stockouts during the sustained demand uplift; in-transit volume will be reconciled by the OR engine when arrivals conclude.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=400. Recent weeks show a clear, large demand uptick: last 4 demands = [80,152,153,522], suggesting a new high-demand regime. Lead time previously confirmed as 2; use promised lead time (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime to reflect the jump: use recent_N over last 4 samples so the OR engine targets higher base-stock and captures current volatility. This preserves service during the spike while the in-transit 400 partially covers upcoming demand; using recent_N prevents dilution by earlier low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting early Sep 2019: avg demand Period30-33 = 226.75 (n=4) vs prior Period27-29 avg = 46.67 (n=3), increase +386%, sustained 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 30 (weeks 30-34 demands = [80,152,153,522,192], mean \u2248220). On-hand=0, in-transit=956 \u2014 pipeline is large (covers multiple weeks) but several recent orders have not concluded (some may be delayed); prior confirmed lead time=2. I set L to default (promised 2) to keep OR engine aligned with contract. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (captures the new Sep high-demand regime, (1+L)-scaled mean over last 5 samples). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent dispersion including the 522 spike. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the higher, sustained demand while relying on the large in-transit pipeline; using recent data avoids averaging down the new regime and helps balance service level vs holding cost given high pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand jumped in early Sep and has stayed high: last 6 weeks demand = [80,152,153,522,192,130], mean \u2248204.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=956 (large pipeline, some prior orders may be delayed/lost but concluded arrivals confirm lead time=2 in history). Choose L by calculating average of observed lead times (evidence: Period2\u2192Period4 arrival). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new high-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples). For volatility I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent variability (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 6). These settings focus the OR backend on the elevated recent demand while respecting observed lead time and existing pipeline to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. Recent weeks (Period30-36) show a sustained high-demand regime (demands: 80,152,153,522,192,130,105; n=7) vs earlier low season. On-hand=0, in-transit=956 (covers several upcoming periods). Historical concluded lead-time evidence supports promised L=2; no recent contrary evidence. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (uses the last 7 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). Using recent samples raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N tightens variability estimate to recent volatility; default lead time keeps backend assumptions aligned with promise and observed confirmations.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since early Sep (Periods 30-33+): recent weekly demands = [80,152,153,522,192,130,105,123] with a clear changepoint starting Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=956 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals will only be visible after lead time). Prior evidence confirmed lead time=2 earlier; no new lead-time evidence since. I set L to default (promised 2). For demand I target the recent high regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 (captures the immediate post-changepoint mean over the most recent stable spike window) and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect volatility in that regime. These choices focus the OR backend on the elevated demand level to avoid stockouts while in-transit inventory resolves, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since early Sep (Period30 onward): last 9 demands = [80,152,153,522,192,130,105,123,156], mean=1613/9\u2248179.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=956 (covers ~5.3 periods at recent mean); confirmed historical lead time evidence shows 2-period arrivals (Period2\u2192Period4). I set L to use observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed LT=2. For demand, I use recent_N with N=9 (regime length=9) so mu_hat reflects the high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 9). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained post-September demand spike while relying on in-transit inventory to limit additional ordering and holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been in the elevated post-September regime (Periods 30-39: [80,152,153,522,192,130,105,123,156,79], sustained high mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=956 (large pipeline). No new confirmed lead-time change since prior confirmation of 2; use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the September uplift and current volatility so the OR engine targets service for the new demand regime while the large in-transit reduces immediate replenishment needs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=956 (large pipeline expected to cover upcoming demand). Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting early Sep (higher demand sustained through current periods). No new lead-time evidence; previously confirmed actual LT=2. I keep L as default (promised LT=2). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=6 to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (uses last 6 demand samples: P35-P40) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects current elevated demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand while the backend's cap will limit over-ordering given pipeline; using recent samples reduces understock risk during the sustained high-demand regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=956 (includes large order from Period 34 that has not concluded). Historical demand shows the Sep+ spike (regime starting Period 30) sustained through recent periods; use recent data to forecast. Several earlier orders have not concluded long past promised LT, suggesting shipments may be delayed/lost; to be conservative I increase assumed lead time. Set L explicit to account for probable longer effective lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (last 12 periods) to capture the higher mean and volatility. This balances higher service level (captures elevated demand) while avoiding excessive holding by using a recent-sample estimate rather than all-time mean.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipment: order on Period 34 (556 units) still in-transit by Period 41 (no conclude); suggests lost/delayed shipments beyond promised LT=2.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning 2019-09-02 (Periods 30+) with weekly demands well above earlier baseline; on-hand=0 but in-transit=1004 (includes past large orders, some delayed). Last confirmed actual lead time remains 2 (no new conclude messages changing LT). To capture the elevated recent demand I use recent_N for demand estimates using the recent high-demand regime (Periods 30..42, regime length=13). I leave L at default (promised=2) because no new confirmed lead-time change in concluded history. This increases the backend base-stock to meet the sustained higher weekly demand while sigma recent_N captures current volatility and prevents over/under-stocking given delayed arrivals.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=1004 (large pipeline including prior unconfirmed arrivals; earlier missing shipment from P34 remains in-transit). Recent demand regime: sustained high demand beginning Period 30 (weeks 2019-09-02..), with regime length 14 periods (P30\u2013P43). No new concluded arrivals to confirm a lead-time change; previous confirmed LT=2 remains the best concluded signal. I set L=default to use the promised 2-period lead time (no concluded evidence to change). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect (1+L)-period demand over the recent high-demand window). This increases target base stock to cover the new regime while the pipeline (1004) will be considered by the OR engine to cap ordering, balancing service level against $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand regime remains elevated since early Sep (sustained high weekly sales including 80,152,153,522 then persistently >70 thereafter and spikes such as 310 in Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=1004 (multiple past orders still in-transit -> evidence of lost/delayed shipments but only concluded lead times show LT=2 historically). I retain promised lead time to avoid overfitting to missing shipments (L=default). For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the post-September high-demand regime; I set N=15 (periods 30..44) to reflect the sustained elevated demand. sigma_hat uses the same recent window to measure volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet higher demand while capping order size via its cap. This balances service level (capture sustained spike) against holding cost given inventory currently zero and large in-transit volume.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent weekly demand has moderated from the large Sept spike; last 5 concluded demands = [74, 310, 49, 58, 55] (note the 310 outlier from Period 42). In-transit = 956 (includes long-outstanding orders). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (Period2->4) and 3 (Period42->45) \u2014 using calculate (avg observed) captures this mix. Use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to prioritize latest demand regime while letting the OR backend weight the 310 outlier into mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices aim to balance service (capture recent demand variability) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and ambiguous lead-time history. No new sustained pattern meets the 3+ period significance threshold.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting 2019-09-02 (Periods 30-46) with weekly demand well above earlier baseline and several large weeks (e.g., Periods 30-33,33). Multiple shipments have been delayed: an order placed on Period 42 arrived on Period 45 (observed lead_time=3) and the large order from Period 34 remains in-transit. To protect service during this high-demand regime and account for observed delivery delays, I set lead time to an explicit higher recent average and base demand estimates on the recent high-demand regime. Therefore: L estimated from recent observed delays using explicit=3; mu_hat uses recent_N over the recent high-demand regime to capture elevated mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N over the same window to capture current volatility. These parameters increase replenishment targets to reduce stockouts given delayed arrivals while the backend will cap orders per its policy.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears increased to 3 periods: Period 42 order arrived in Period 45 (lead_time=3); large Period 34 order (556 units) remains in-transit well past promised LT, indicating sustained delivery delays.
