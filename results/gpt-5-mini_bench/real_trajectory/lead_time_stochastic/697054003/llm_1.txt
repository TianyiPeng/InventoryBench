Lead-time & missing orders: multiple historical shipments (P1,P3,P4,P13 etc.) remained missing long; evidence of intermittent lost/delayed shipments. Some arrivals showed actual lead time = 1 (e.g., P9\u2192P10, P16\u2192P17) and sometimes 2 (P12\u2192P14, P20\u2192P22). Current pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=611 but much of that represents historically missing shipments and should not be relied upon. Risk trade-off: profit = $1/unit and holding = $1/unit/period => holding destroys expected profit if inventory sits unsold. Forecast & order logic: expected weekly demand \u2248 74. Promised lead time=2 but actual often 1 or lost; ordering now cannot help P32 demand. To capture sales next week if lead time behaves like recent 1-period arrivals while avoiding large holding cost or overstocking in case of delays/loss, place a conservative order roughly equal to one-week demand (~75).",

  "rationale": "Date is 2019-12-30 (week between Christmas and New Year) \u2014 apparel demand can be variable but recent weeks show moderate weekly demand (P42\u2013P46: 137,74,26,75,53; more typical recent weekly demand \u224850\u201380). Historical lead times are inconsistent (observed 1,2,3 periods at different times); some earlier shipments have been lost/delayed per carry-over history. Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 731 \u2014 a very large pipeline relative to expected weekly demand. Given Profit = $1/unit and Holding = $1/unit/period, excess inventory carries a full-period cost equal to profit, so over-ordering is strongly penalized. With a large in-transit position and uncertain arrival timing, the conservative action is to place no new order this period to avoid high holding costs while awaiting confirmed arrivals and to let pipeline clear. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime shifts meet the 3+ period significance threshold beyond existing carry-over notes.",
