Required coverage: (L+1)=3 periods \u2192 expected demand \u22483\xd7293=879 units. Assessment vs OR: OR recommends 120 but it ignores pipeline; pipeline (900) already exceeds the 3-period demand cover (900>879) so additional ordering risks unnecessary holding cost. Risk considerations: holiday season (Period 46 = 2019-12-23) can spike demand, but pipeline already provides a small buffer over the 3-period expected demand; profit/holding (profit=$19, holding=$1) yields a high critical fractile, but ordering more now yields marginal profit while incurring holding cost across periods. Decision: do not order this period to avoid excess holding cost while existing in-transit stock should cover near-term demand and lead time. Plan: monitor arrivals in conclude messages to confirm in-transit actually arrives (watch for lost shipments) and re-order if concluded arrivals are lower than expected or if on-hand + in-transit falls below (L+1)\xd7expected demand.",

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=900 units. Demand outlook: sustained higher-demand regime since Period 27 (avg \u2248293 units/week) and recent holiday volatility (e.g., Period 42 demand=733) imply single-period demand ~293\u2013350 in current regime. Coverage check: with promised lead time 2, decision must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand; 3\xd7293\u2248879 units. The pipeline (900) already exceeds this coverage, so placing additional order would only raise holding costs ($1/unit/period) while providing little incremental profit (profit $19/unit) given uncertain arrival timing. OR recommended 113 units based on promised lead time and historical mean; I override by reducing order to 0 because existing pipeline adequately covers the forecasted (L+1)-period demand and we should avoid unnecessary holding cost.
