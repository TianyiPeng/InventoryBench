  "rationale": "Observations & lead-time: Promised lead time = 2. Period-1 conclude shows ordered=218 arrived=0 (demand=250, sold=0) and in-transit=218 now; we cannot conclude shipments are lost or lead time differs until we see a later conclude. Therefore assume supplier may still honor L=2 but arrivals will not be visible until Period 4 conclude. Inventory math & coverage target: With L=2 we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand (current period's demand will occur after this decision). OR recommendation = 259 (based on historical mean \u03bc\u0304\u2248144.6 and OR's base-stock/cap logic). Recent realized demand in Period 1 was 250 \u2014 a one-period spike well above historical mean (single data point, so not a confirmed regime change). Risk assessment: Pipeline=218 already in-transit; if true demand remains near historical mean the OR recommendation is reasonable. However, the observed 250 demand suggests risk of shortfall if demand has shifted upward. I will moderately increase supply relative to OR to provide extra cover for possible elevated demand while limiting holding cost exposure. Final strategy & order quantity: Increase OR's 259 by ~20% to 310 units to build additional buffer against the recent 250 demand spike while recognizing it is not yet a sustained regime shift. This keeps total committed (218 in-transit + 310 ordered = 528) providing roughly ~1.9\u20132.0 periods of coverage if demand is 250, and >3 periods if demand reverts to historical mean (~145).",

Lead-time inference: concluded messages show no arrivals yet; the P1 order should have appeared in Period3 conclude if actual lead time=2, but it did not, so there is evidence of delayed or lost shipments. However this is only one missed expected arrival so far (P2 arrival still possible in next conclude), so lead-time/loss is not yet conclusively established per carry-over rules. Inventory policy: demand is high (~339/week). With L+1=3 periods coverage needed, expected demand over (L+1) \u2248 3*338.7 \u2248 1,016 units; pipeline 528 covers only ~1.6 weeks. OR's capped base-stock balances service vs. cap; its 299 order increases pipeline toward the baseline while respecting its cap. Decision tradeoffs: (1) Ordering aggressively risks increasing holding cost if in-transit eventually all arrive and demand falls; (2) Not ordering risks stockouts given high observed demand and possibly lost earlier shipments. Given current ambiguous evidence of lost shipments and clearly high demand, I follow the OR recommendation to replenish moderately.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows multiple 2-period arrivals (e.g., P2\u2192P4, P11\u2192P13, P20\u2192P22, P41\u2192P43) so actual lead time = 2 (matches promised). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 14, in-transit = 1249 (large pipeline despite some earlier lost shipments noted in history). Recent weekly demand (Periods 43\u201346 = 50, 103, 114, 69) averages ~84 units/week; (L+1)=3 period coverage target \u2248252 units. Pipeline + on-hand (1263) >> required coverage (\u2248252), so additional ordering risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while marginal profit is $4. OR recommended 0 using promised L and historical demand; given confirmed lead time=2 and a healthy pipeline, I follow OR and order 0 to avoid excess holding costs. Final action: order 0 units.",
