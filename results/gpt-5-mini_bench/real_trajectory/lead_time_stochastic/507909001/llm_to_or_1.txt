Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 507909001: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals/history to suggest lead-time deviations. Use promised lead time (default) L=2 because no observed lead-time evidence. Demand history (5 weekly samples) shows mean ~144.6; with L=2 use default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean) to capture 3-period demand and default sigma_hat to reflect observed variability. This balances service (cover 3 periods) vs holding cost given modest profit-to-holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent historical weekly demands (Jan\u2013Feb) average ~144.6 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=218 (order placed P1); arrival not yet concluded so actual lead time unconfirmed \u2014 treat promised lead time as default. Use default demand aggregation to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std so base-stock reflects the full review+lead horizon. This balances service (covering ~3 weeks of demand with current pipeline) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded periods show our orders (P1:218, P2:259) have not yet arrived (arrived=0), but there is no concluded arrival to infer an actual lead time different from the promised 2. Historical demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 144.6 units/week; on-hand=0 and in-transit=477 (~3.3 weeks of historical mean demand). I therefore keep L as default (promised=2) because there is insufficient concluded evidence of a lead-time change or lost shipments. I also use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level and holding cost given current uncertainty and the existing in-transit coverage.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand mean = 144.6 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). Three consecutive orders (P1:218, P2:259, P3:314) have not concluded by Period 3 conclude; in-transit=791 equals sum of those orders, indicating shipments delayed/lost versus promised L=2. Be conservative and assume longer lead time to avoid stockouts. Set L explicitly to 4 to cover additional delay; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend scales demand over (1+L) periods using all samples. This raises target base stock to cover longer pipeline while sigma default preserves historical variability.

Carry-over insight: Observed sustained shipment delays: orders placed P1(218), P2(259), P3(314) did not arrive by Period 3 conclude; in-transit=791. Treat actual lead time as longer than promised (evidence over 3 periods).

Daily Profit: $856.00, Daily Holding Cost: $45.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $811.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent history: P1,P2,P3 orders placed; only P2 concluded with lead_time=2 (arrived in P4). P1 and P3 remain in-transit despite promised L=2, indicating longer/unstable lead times. To be conservative against delayed shipments I set explicit L=3 (anticipate slower arrivals). Demand history (5 samples, mean\u2248144.6) is stable with no clear recent demand regime shift, so I use default demand scaling (mu_hat default = (1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility (sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These choices raise the backend base-stock to cover an extra review+lead period while keeping variability estimates consistent, trading higher inventory to avoid stockouts given observed shipment delays.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weekly demand has been volatile but trending lower after a Feb peak: last 5 demands = [250,454,312,214,190]. On-hand=0, in-transit=1012 (many overdue arrivals historically). Observed concluded lead time = 2 (P2 arrived in P4) but multiple prior orders were delayed; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods to cover potential extended transit. I forecast demand over review+lead using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the recent regime (use recent_N=5). Volatility also from the same recent 5 samples. These choices increase safety stock against delayed arrivals while relying on recent demand to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Recent observed customer demand (Periods1-6) is high and consistently above the older sample set (period demands: 250,454,312,214,190,173). On-hand=0, in-transit=1249 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but past orders experienced variable deliveries (some long delays then partial arrivals). For L I use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (we have observed lead times 2 and 1). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (use last 6 demand observations) so the base-stock and caps reflect current demand rather than older low-sample history. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline uncertainty) against holding cost by basing safety stock on recent volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed 2 and 1 periods), and on-hand=0, in-transit=1249 which currently provides substantial coverage. I set L using recent_N to let backend average the two most recent observed lead times (capture recent variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last five weekly demands: 312,214,190,173,255) to reflect the most recent regime rather than the full historical sample; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices balance service (using recent demand mean and observed lead-time average) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and variable arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent realized demand is high and variable (last 3 period demands: P6=173, P7=255, P8=354; avg\u2248260.7) and on-hand=0 with large in-transit=947 but prior shipments showed mixed lead times (observed lead_times: 2,1,2). Use a short recent window to capture the current high-demand regime and the recent variability while letting L reflect the most recent observed lead-time mix. Choices: L via recent_N(3) to average the last 3 observed lead times (captures 2,1,2 -> avg\u22481.67) so the OR backend plans for slightly longer than 1 period; mu_hat recent_N(3) to scale (1+L) by the mean of the last 3 demand samples (~260.7) to target service amid current high demand; sigma_hat recent_N(3) to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service level (profit $4 vs stockout loss) against holding cost $1 by using recent demand/volatility and a lead-time estimate informed by observed arrivals; large in-transit suggests some orders are delayed/lost, so relying on recent demand reduces under-forecasting risk.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent realized demand is high and volatile (recent demands: P5-9 = 190,173,255,354,147) and multiple concluded arrivals show lead times around 1\u20132 periods (observed LT sequence = 2,1,2). In-transit is large (947) while on-hand=0; overdue/lost shipments risk remains. I set L using recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent observed lead-time behavior rather than promised LT=2. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest high-demand regime (reduces bias from early low-Jan samples). Sigma is recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated short-term demand while recognizing current lead-time evidence and limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4 (service-weighted safety stock via OR backend).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent realized demand has been high and volatile (recent demands P6-P10 = 173,255,354,147,218; recent mean \u2248229). On-hand=0, in-transit=947 \u2014 many units are outstanding and some shipments have been delayed/lost historically. To be conservative versus missed arrivals, I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L) scaling will be applied by backend). These choices increase target base-stock to protect service level given volatile, elevated recent demand while acknowledging holding cost via capped orders in OR engine.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been volatile but persistently elevated (period demands: 250,454,312,214,190,173,255,354,147,218,140). On-hand=0, in-transit=1055 (many overdue arrivals earlier), indicating shipments have been delayed beyond the promised 2 periods. To protect service while accounting for longer actual lead times, I set L explicit=3 (conservative estimate above promised 2). For demand I use recent_N over the last 11 observed demand samples to capture the current regime without overweighting old sparse samples: mu_hat recent_N N=11. For variability I use recent_N with N=11 to reflect recent volatility for safety stock sizing. These choices increase the (1+L) review horizon and use recent demand statistics so the OR backend raises target base-stock to cover longer lead time and recent higher demand while accounting for observed volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent realized demand has risen vs. the Jan baseline (recent 5-period mean ~201 units vs. historical ~145). On-hand=0, in-transit=1145 (large pipeline but arrivals have been inconsistent historically). Observed lead times in concluded history: 2,1,2 (for recent arrivals), so I use recent average to capture current variability. I set L=recent_N (N=3) to reflect the last 3 observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the apparent upward regime in the most recent 5 demands (weights the OR base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand). For sigma I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to raise target inventory to preserve service given higher recent demand while using recent volatility to limit excess safety stock and holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand history shows no clear recent regime shift vs. provided samples. To capture slight increase in realized lead time while letting OR backend use full-sample demand stats, set L by calculating average observed lead time; use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (higher L increases mu_hat) against holding cost given profits/holding.

Given pipeline size and concluded lead-time observations, use averaged observed lead time to let backend account for occasional 1-period arrival but mostly 2-period reality. Use default demand and volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base_stock consistent with full review+lead demand; this balances service (high pipeline) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Recent concluded history shows repeated lead_time=2 arrivals (orders placed P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13, P12->P14). On-hand=0, in-transit=947 so substantial pipeline exists but arrivals are delayed until concluded confirmations. I set L explicitly to 2 to reflect confirmed actual lead time (backend promised 2 but we now have strong evidence). For demand, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full historical demand while the explicit L ensures the pipeline coverage target uses the observed lead time. This balances service level (using confirmed L) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: ordered P2 arrived P4; ordered P6 arrived P8; ordered P11 arrived P13; ordered P12 arrived P14).

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=947 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 4,8,13,14 etc.) support actual lead time = 2; no new evidence of a sustained demand regime shift. I choose L=default (use promised lead time=2) to align with confirmed observed lead times. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the historical samples; this leverages the backend's base-stock formula while avoiding overreacting to the large in-transit volume which already provides coverage for the (1+L) demand window.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times centered near 2 (multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals) though one 1-period event occurred; demand since Period 1 is elevated vs. the provided Jan samples, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the mix of 1s and 2s seen). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (use last 17 observed demand periods) to capture the sustained post-Jan higher-demand regime rather than the stale five-sample archive. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=17 to align volatility with the same recent window. These choices make the OR engine target a base-stock that reflects current lead-time behavior and the sustained higher demand, balancing service level (profit-driven) versus holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent demand is volatile but has trended higher in the last 5 concl. On-hand=0, in-transit=947 (many units expected but arrivals confirm actual lead time historically = 2). No new sustained lead-time or seasonal shifts detected. Set L to promised (2) consistent with confirmed observations. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (periods 14-18 demands: 86,97,64,189,176) so the OR backend's (1+L) scaling captures current elevated variability while limiting excess holding. This balances service-level (profit > holding cost) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Recent weeks show high weekly demand (several 150\u2013277 samples) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=947, indicating many outstanding shipments but no visible arrivals in recent concludes\u2014possible delayed/lost shipments. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,2,2} (avg 1.8). I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) reflecting long-run sample mean across the review+lead period; sigma_hat='default' to use overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost given large in-transit and uncertain arrivals.

Historical concluded lead-time observations cluster at 2 periods (multiple P->P+2 arrivals) with one 1-period outlier; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (most recent 5 periods: P19-P23) shows a higher, stable regime (277,205,200,178,105 \u2192 mean \u2248193); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect the current demand regime and avoid diluting with early-sample seasonality. These parameters balance service (maintain stock given large pipeline uncertainty) versus holding cost by reacting to recent realized demand and observed lead-time behavior.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=947. Recent demand (Periods 20-24) shows weekly demands ~205,200,178,105,117 \u2014 lower than early-sample highs but variable. Historical conclude messages (multiple orders observed arriving with 2-period delays) support using observed lead-time statistics rather than treating all earlier multi-period delays as permanent. I choose L=calculate to let the backend average observed lead times (uses concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 20-24 mean \u2248161) and scale by (1+L) inside the OR engine. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These settings keep target base-stock responsive to current demand while relying on observed lead-time data and the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=947 (large pipeline but many past periods showed arrivals=0 \u2192 some shipments may be delayed or lost). Recent concluded arrivals (multiple orders showing 2-period lead time and one 1-period) support using an empiric average lead time rather than the promised default. I choose L="calculate" so the backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Demand shows no clear, sustained regime shift in the last 3+ periods (weekly demands vary but not a permanent jump/drop), so use default demand estimates to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full history. This balances service (use observed lead time) versus holding cost (defaults avoid overreacting to transient fluctuations and let the capped policy limit order size given uncertain in-transit stock).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent weekly demand (Periods 7-26) has been lower and more stable than early 2019; on-hand=0 but in-transit=947 which is large relative to recent weekly demand and likely covers multiple review+lead periods. Historical concluded arrivals since Period16 consistently show actual lead time = 2, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect recent summer demand regime, set demand estimate using recent_N=20 (captures last 20 observed weeks) so mu_hat and sigma_hat respond to the lower recent mean and measured variability. This balances service (using pipeline + recent demand forecast) against holding cost by avoiding inflation from early high-demand weeks while relying on large in-transit stock to meet near-term demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=947. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 2 (confirmed Period 16). Use promised/default lead time. Demand has been variable but recent weeks show mixed moderate-to-high demand; to capture recent regime while smoothing noise, use recent_N=10 for demand mean and std (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std over the review+lead window. This balances service-level (protect against stockouts given large pipeline and variable recent demand) vs. holding cost by relying on recent demand statistics rather than all-time average.

To avoid over-adjusting for missing arrivals that are not yet conclusively lost, use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std over the full sample history. This balances service (use existing large pipeline) against holding cost without adding extra inventory for unconfirmed shifts.

Many past periods had zero arrivals but those are unconfirmed until conclude messages; treat lead time empirically. Use L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history is broad; no clear sustained regime change detected, so use default \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=947 (large pipeline but many past orders\u672aconcluded in recent weeks). Recent weekly demands (historic samples and latest periods) average ~194 over initial 5-sample history; more recent weeks show higher variability and several weeks of 200-340 demand. Past concluded evidence (Period 16) confirmed actual lead time = 2, and no new sustained lead-time evidence since. To balance service vs holding cost with promised L=2 still supported, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean across all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps policy conservative given large in-transit volume and avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=947 (many outstanding shipments). Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times (observed lead_times: 2,1,2,2,2) so recent evidence supports an average \u22481.8 but no sustained shift away from promised 2; choose backend-led average for L. Demand history (weekly samples from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) will be scaled by (1+L) by the backend; using default mu_hat/sigma_hat lets the OR engine apply the computed L and full-sample statistics. This balances service (use observed avg lead time) vs holding cost by not inflating demand/variance estimates prematurely given limited recent regime evidence and mixed short delays.

Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,1,2,2,2} \u2192 avg \u22481.8; use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead times. Demand history (5 weekly samples from Jan 2019) is limited but recent weeks show higher demand; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding -> z) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods (with one 1-period outlier), so I let the backend compute an average observed lead time (method=calculate). To capture the full sample demand history for forecasting and volatility the mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples). This balances service level (higher demand recently) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline and some evidence of past shipment delays.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent concluded history (Periods with arrivals) shows actual lead time consistent with 2 periods; large in-transit pipeline = 947 and on-hand = 0 means no immediate shortage. Use promised/default lead time to align with OR engine (promised=2). Demand history shows sustained elevated weekly demand since summer (many samples), so use default aggregate demand stats ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These settings let the backend compute a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost given the long pipeline and observed lead-time confirmations. No new lost-shipment signal requiring explicit L change.

LLM Rationale:

Recent weeks (Periods 31-35) show elevated demand [329,339,378,208,128]; in-transit stock roughly covers a (1+L)-period forecast if we use a recent demand estimate. Promised lead time remains 2 and recent concluded arrivals have supported L=2, so use default promised L. To capture the recent demand regime (late summer/early fall spike) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 weeks: this focuses the OR engine on current demand levels and variability so the computed base-stock will aim to use the large in-transit balance without overstocking long-term.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent concluded history (Periods 4,8,13-14,16) supports actual lead time = 2 for sustained stretches; no new concluded arrivals since Period 36 to indicate a change. On-hand=0, in-transit=982 (large pipeline) will cover upcoming demand once arrivals conclude. Demand has trended higher in recent months (Sep peaks) but no new changepoint confirmed; therefore use default methods so OR backend uses full-sample statistics with promised lead time. This balances service (use confirmed L=2 via history) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=982. Recent concluded history (Periods 29\u201337) shows a sustained higher demand regime (9 weeks: 255,344,329,339,378,208,128,127,158). Earlier carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 2. To balance service vs holding cost I use promised/confirmed lead time (default) and estimate demand using the most recent 9-week regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so orders respond to the sustained higher demand while capping exposure to delayed/lost shipments given large in-transit quantity.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=982. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time was confirmed as 2 periods around Period 16; no new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time since then. Large in-transit balance may reflect earlier pipeline but recent conclude messages (many periods) contain no new consistent evidence of a different lead time or a sustained demand regime shift. To avoid overreacting to delayed/no-conclude arrivals and since profit/holding tradeoff is moderate (profit=4, holding=1), use default (promised) lead time and default demand/volatility derived from full sample history so the OR backend applies its calibrated service-level cap and prevents excessive ordering that increases holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=947 units (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead-time observations: {2,1,2,2,2,3} \u2192 mean = 2.0. Use L='calculate' to let backend compute avg observed lead time (reflects occasional 1 and 3 but centers on 2). Demand shows sustained weekly volumes (historical samples and many recent demands); use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std for safety given high pipeline. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by keeping base-stock driven by observed demand statistics while avoiding manual overcorrection for a single 3-period observation and potential lost shipments.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=947. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (recent observed lead_times: P39:3, P14:2, P13:2). To be responsive to the most recent arrival evidence, set L using recent_N over the last 3 observed lead times (captures the recent 3, including the 3-period observation). Demand has risen through the year vs. early samples; use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent demand regime. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale variability with (1+L). These choices balance service (capture recent higher demand and longer recent lead) against holding cost by using recent data rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=947 \u2014 large pipeline but many past delays and a recent single 3-period arrival (ordered P36 arrived P39). Historical concluded lead-time evidence is mixed (confirmed 2-period stretches earlier, isolated 3-period delay later) so I will not override promised lead time. Use default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this keeps decisions aligned with long-run data while the backend caps orders to limit exposure to potential lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=947. Historical concluded arrivals (Period 16 evidence) confirm actual lead time = 2 periods; later single 3-period event appears isolated. To respect supplier promise and confirmed history, use L method=default (promised=2). Recent demand increased starting Sept (many weeks with 300+ units); to capture this regime shift I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 demand observations to reflect the elevated fall demand and variance). This balances higher service level (avoid stockouts given large pipeline) against holding cost by basing base_stock on recent higher mean and empirically measured volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=947 (large pipeline). Visible concluded lead-time samples average ~2.0 (observed lead_times: 2,1,2,2,2,3). Recent demand has been variable; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 39-43) = [104,96,105,150,50], mean=101. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time \u22482, matching confirmed evidence at Period 16 and recent samples. For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest demand regime ((1+L)*mean_recent = 3*101 \u2248303) given seasonal variability and large in-transit; this avoids inflating orders by older high-demand weeks. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to recent demand while acknowledging the ~2-period lead time and large pipeline to limit excess ordering and holding cost.

Given large in-transit volume and recent confirmations of L=2, use calculated lead time to let backend average observed lead times. Demand exhibits seasonality through 2019 (multiple weeks of high weekly demand) but no clear recent regime shift requiring manual override; use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (use observed L=2) against holding costs given high in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=947 (large pipeline). Recent demand (Periods 42-46) is lower than earlier in-year \u2014 seasonally muted year-end. No new sustained lead-time evidence beyond prior confirmation of L=2 at Period 16. To avoid overstating demand from older high-volume weeks, I use a short recent window (N=5) for demand mean and volatility (captures the year-end lull). Keep L as default (promised lead time) so OR backend assumes 2; using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat reduces ordering given large in-transit stock and lower recent demand.
