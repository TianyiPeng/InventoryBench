Promised L=2 was confirmed earlier (Period2\u2192Period4 arrival). Historical weekly mean from samples =61.6 units; recent realized weekly demand (Periods 4-9) averages \u224852.5 but volatile (41\u201367). OR recommended 49 (base-stock capped) using promised lead time and full pipeline. Decision logic: because we have evidence of at least one lost shipment and some lead-time variability, the effective future pipeline is likely lower than reported 122; ordering exactly OR's 49 risks stockouts if any portion of the in-transit is lost or further delays occur. However demand has softened relative to the long-run mean, so I avoid a large overshoot that increases holding cost. Action chosen: increase OR recommendation moderately to provide a safety buffer against lost/delayed shipments while limiting holding cost.

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=700. Recent realized weekly demand has surged: Period43=235, P44=370, P45=293 \u2192 recent 3-period average \u2248299 units/week.

Current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit)=700, leaving a shortfall \u2248197 units to avoid lost sales during peak weeks. OR recommended 0 (it uses long-run history and promised L), which understates urgent need given the clear 3-week spike. Profit per unit = $4, holding cost = $1 so critical fractile high; holding is less costly than lost profit. Strategy: place an order to cover the estimated shortfall while avoiding large overstock if spike is short-lived. Order 200 units (rounded slightly above the 197 shortfall) to bring effective pipeline closer to covering the 3-week peak while limiting holding cost exposure if demand fades. This balances protecting sales during confirmed peak weeks versus holding cost risk.
