Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11): demand history shows weekly samples [36,21,10,12,16] with mean=19. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, no conclude messages exist to infer lead-time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service (covering review+lead demand) vs holding cost given limited evidence of regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 19 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=37. Promised lead time is 2 and there is no concluded arrival yet (Period 1 order ordered=37, arrived=0 is expected because arrival would show in Period 3 conclude), so no evidence of lead-time shift or lost shipment. I use default lead time (promised=2). Using default demand aggregation (1+L)\xd7mean -> (1+2)\xd719 \u224857 units to cover current + L periods; pipeline (37) leaves a shortfall (~20) so the OR engine will top up toward that base stock. Volatility defaults are used so the backend balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demands: Period1=46, Period2=73 (up from historical mean ~19). On-hand=0, in-transit=85 (matches ordered 37+48). No concluded arrivals yet so no confirmed lead-time change. I set L to default (use promised 2). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to respond to an apparent upward demand regime while smoothing with the last available older sample; using last 3 samples (P2 73, P1 46, 2019-02-04 16) yields a moderate uplift without overreacting to two points. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This increases the base stock to improve service given higher short-term demand while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=177, historical concluded periods show no arrivals yet (orders placed in P1-P3 still unconfirmed). I use promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals provide evidence to change it. Demand history (samples: 36,21,10,12,16; mean=19) drives forecast; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. No explicit adjustment for possible lost shipments without sustained concluded evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $192.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=129. Historical sample mean (Jan-Feb) ~19/wk but recent observed demand (Periods 2-4) = 73,73,142 indicating a sustained demand uplift; one in-transit shipment (ordered P2) arrived with lead_time=2 (matches promised). Orders from P1 and P3 have not concluded and may be delayed/lost but we only have one confirmed lead-time observation so keep promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 3 observed periods: 73,73,142) so the backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to improve service while acknowledging holding cost via backend's z* tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: recent Periods 2-4 avg demand = 96 (73,73,142) vs prior sample mean = 19 (Jan-Feb) \u2014 increase ~+405%; record as sustained (3 periods).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent data shows a sustained demand regime shift (Periods 2-4 avg \u224896 and recent demands 73,142,234), and we observed an order placed in Period 2 arriving in Period 4 (lead_time=2). On-hand=0, in-transit=291 (large pipeline). Set L using observed lead times to reflect actual behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (uses last 3 demand samples: P3-P5) so the OR base-stock reflects current elevated demand. Sigma uses recent_N (N=3) to match volatility in the same recent window. This balances service (capture higher demand) while pipeline inventory (291) will temper ordering, avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has risen sharply (P4-P6: 142,234,311) vs earlier Jan-Feb mean ~19 \u2014 sustained high-demand regime persists. Pipeline shows on-hand=0, in-transit=405 (covers multiple periods) but recent concluded lead times vary (observed 2 and 1). To balance service and holding cost: set L based on the most recent observed lead times (average of last 2 observed); set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand to reflect the new high-demand regime (use last 4 demand samples) so the OR engine targets higher base-stock while keeping variability estimated from recent data.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward (sustained high demands in Periods 5-7: 234,311,250). On-hand=0, large in-transit=722 units (may include delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) -> use average of observed lead times. Set L by calculating average observed lead time to let backend capture recent variability. For demand forecast use recent_N=3 (Periods 5-7) to target the new high-demand regime; use same recent_N=3 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to cover (1+L) periods of much higher demand while letting the OR engine compute safety-stock via q based on profit/holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has materially increased vs Jan-Feb baseline; last 5 period demands = [142,234,311,250,94], mean ~206. On-hand=499, in-transit=262; pipeline plus on-hand (761) comfortably covers near-term demand but variability and observed lead times have fluctuated between 1 and 2 periods. Observed lead times from concluded messages = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5). I select L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher regime while smoothing the recent dip (Period 8=94). Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher service (covering (1+L) periods of the new regime) while exposing holding cost moderately given large on-hand inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has risen and become volatile: last 5 period demands = [234,311,250,94,187] (mean 215.2). Current inventory: on-hand=312, in-transit=262. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); average of observed lead times = 1.5, so use calculated average for L. To reflect the recent elevated demand regime and higher variance, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures periods 5\u20139). These choices ensure the OR engine targets a base stock sized to recent demand (improving service) while sigma from recent volatility informs safety stock and limits over/under ordering given mixed lead-time observations.

Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=242, in-transit=319 (pipeline+on-hand=561). Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods); average used to reflect variability. Demand has shifted up vs Jan-Feb baseline (sustained shift recorded earlier), so I use recent sample-based demand forecast (last 5 periods) to capture the new higher regime and recent volatility. These settings balance service (higher mu_hat for elevated demand) while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit overstock given sizable on-hand + in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=138, in-transit=503. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W={2,1,2,1,2}, mean\u22481.6) so I let the backend compute the average lead time from observed data. Demand has shifted to a higher regime and recent periods show sustained elevated demand; I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the current regime dynamics (N=6 covers the most recent six demand observations: P6-P11). I apply recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR engine set a base-stock that reflects the higher recent mean while the computed L and recent volatility limit overstating safety stock given holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=30, in-transit=559; promised L=2 but observed lead times vary (1 and 2). Recent demand elevated vs Jan-Feb: last 5 demands = [94,187,203,104,108], mean \u2248139.2. To capture current higher-demand regime and variable lead time I set L to be calculated from observed lead-time history, mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 demand samples to reflect current rate and volatility. This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302) against holding cost by using recent data rather than the long-run low-demand mean.

Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 5; recent demands (Periods 10-14 = 203,104,108,61,74) better reflect current level. To be responsive while avoiding excess holding cost: set L based on recent lead-time observations (average of last 3 = 2), and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the most recent regime sample.

Demand regime shift recorded at Period 5 (sustained higher demand thereafter); use recent demand to capture the new regime. Choose L by calculating the average observed lead time to reflect measured variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (covers periods since the confirmed regime shift, N = min(regime_length,20) = 11) so the OR backend targets inventory for the higher recent demand and updated volatility while respecting the promised lead-time model.

Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,2,2] (avg ~1.71) so use calculated average L to capture variability. Recent demand has declined from the earlier peak; use recent_N (last 4 periods: P13-P16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current lower run-rate (~63 units/wk) and tighter volatility. These choices reduce ordering toward the large existing pipeline while letting the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost given the inferred lead-time variability.

Demand has shifted up persistently since Period 5 (sustained high-demand regime from Period 5\u201318, ~14 periods); use recent_N over that regime to estimate demand and volatility so OR base-stock reflects the new higher mean and higher variability while the L estimate accounts for mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. This balances service (avoid stockouts during elevated demand) vs holding cost by sizing mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent high-demand regime and letting backend compute final base stock and cap.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=555. Recent concluded lead times vary (1\u20132); use aggregate observed average to let backend learn typical lead time. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 5; I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) to capture the elevated mean (recent demands: P15\u2013P19 = 69,49,120,173,217). Using recent demand (N=5) for mu and sigma will raise the base-stock to meet current high demand while the backend's capped order limits will prevent extreme over-ordering despite a large in-transit. This also accounts for possible overdue shipments (in-transit large but arrivals intermittent); using observed lead-time average (calculate) avoids underestimating replenishment lag.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=555 (large pipeline). Recent demand has stabilized higher: last 4 periods (P17-P20) demands = [120,173,217,159], showing sustained elevated demand (~avg 167). Observed concluded lead times (8 samples) average ~1.625 with variability (mix of 1 and 2); shipments have sometimes arrived late or early so use observed average lead time. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (focus on P17-P20). These choices balance service (cover next L+1 periods of elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit. 

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed variable: observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1], average = 1.625 (8 samples); shipments alternate between 1 and 2 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. Recent demand has been elevated: last 4 weekly demands = [173,217,159,178], avg \u2248 182/week (much higher than Jan-Feb baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=561 units (large pipeline). Historical observed lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods (avg \u22481.625). I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect variable actual LT. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime and avoid diluting forecast with low early-year samples. For sigma I use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These settings push the backend to set a higher base-stock matching the recent demand spike while leveraging the large in-transit pile to avoid over-ordering.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has stayed high (multiple periods of ~160-220 since Period 6), consistent with the previously recorded demand regime shift (Period 5). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=582 (large pipeline). Observed lead times have alternated 1\u20132 periods (historical observed average ~1.625). To reflect persistent higher demand while grounding variability and lead-time uncertainty: set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the most recent 8 high-demand samples; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture current volatility from the same recent window.

I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average lead time from concluded history (captures observed 1\u20132 alternation). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean computed by backend). For sigma I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated demand while letting the backend cap limit excess replenishment given pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=584 which likely covers several weeks but arrivals have been variable (observed lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods, avg ~1.625). Use recent lead-time estimate to reflect this variability and avoid under-ordering. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 and recent weeks remain elevated (last 5 demands: 178,174,203,273,127 => mean ~191), so set demand forecast using recent_N=5 to capture current level and volatility. These choices raise base stock to protect service while limiting excess holding given substantial in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2 periods) and a sustained demand regime increase recorded earlier. Recent realized weekly demand has come down in the last 3 weeks (Periods 25-27: 127,107,46). To be responsive to the most recent demand trend while accounting for pipeline and variable lead time, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (use backend average). For demand forecast use recent_N based on the last 3 demand observations to capture the current lower level; apply the same recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock adaptive (lowering target given recent fall) while letting the OR backend reconcile service level using its lead-time model and the large in-transit quantity.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=651 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals have been intermittent (observed lead times vary between 1 and 2). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (sustained higher weekly demand). I choose to let the backend infer an effective lead time from observed concludes (method: calculate) to reflect the 1\u20132 period variability. For demand level I prefer an EWMA to weight recent high-demand periods more heavily while smoothing volatility (EWMA_gamma). Volatility will be estimated from recent observations to capture current variability (recent_N). These settings bias orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while avoiding extreme over-ordering given significant in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=651 units. Historical arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2); pipeline is large but arrival timing uncertain. I select L="calculate" so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history. Demand has clearly shifted up in recent months; to capture current regime I use recent_N for demand parameters with N=8 (most recent 8 demand samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean/volatility and help the OR engine set a higher base-stock while avoiding excessive safety stock given pipeline. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost and accounts for uncertain arrivals by letting L be estimated from observed lead times.

Demand regime shifted up at Period 5 and has persisted \u2014 use recent demand (most recent regime) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. Chose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat recent_N with N=20 (regime since Period 5, capped at 20) to capture current high-demand level across the review+lead window; sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and limiting excess holding costs via the backend cap.

Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (sustained high weekly demand). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the alternating 1\u20132 period pattern). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the sustained post-changepoint high-demand regime (cap at 20 samples) so the base-stock target reflects current elevated demand while limiting sensitivity to older low-demand samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but variable arrivals) against holding cost by using a demand estimate driven by the recent high-demand regime and an updated lead-time estimate.

Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures alternating 1\u20132 period pattern). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility rather than dilute with early low-demand samples. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the current high-demand regime while the large in-transit should be credited by the OR engine when computing net order; chosen params balance service level (avoid stockouts in high demand) against holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than all-time mean.

LLM Rationale:

Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 5 (many weeks with demand >> Jan-Feb baseline). Lead times have alternated between 1 and 2 periods (variable). To capture the shorter effective lead time seen in concluded history while letting the backend use observed average, set L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average. For demand I target recent behavior: use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained high-demand regime over the last ~20 periods (gives (1+L)-scaled recent mean and volatility), which balances service level against holding cost given large pipeline. This avoids overreacting to very old low-demand samples and lets the OR engine compute base_stock and cap from recent demand statistics.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=651. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (mix of 1 and 2) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5. To account for variable lead time use a recent average of observed lead times (captures alternation). For demand forecast use recent demand window to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and reduce bias from small Jan-Feb samples. Chosen parameters raise (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to improve service given large in-transit but zero on-hand, while keeping L informed by recent actuals so OR backend\u2019s base-stock balances profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=651 \u2014 large pipeline but arrival timing uncertain due to historically variable lead times. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence avg \u22481.625); demand regime shift occurred at Period 5 and has persisted. To reflect actual observed lead-time variability I let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). For demand I use a recent-window estimate to capture the post-changepoint regime: recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent sustained higher-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect current demand level and volatility while avoiding contamination from the very early low-demand samples. This balances the high service target (profit/holding \u2192 q=0.8) against holding cost given the large in-transit volume and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=651. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence [2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1], avg\u22481.625) so I use a recent-N lead time estimate to capture the alternating 1\u20132 pattern. Demand regime shifted upward at Period 5 and has remained elevated; to reflect the sustained higher demand I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility based on the most recent 20 samples so the OR backend sets base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead periods under the current regime while the recent-N sigma captures recent demand dispersion. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and variable lead time) against holding cost by grounding estimates in recent high-demand data.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=651. Use observed lead-time history to let backend compute average actual L (orders have been arriving 1\u20132 periods). Demand has an older sustained regime shift (Periods 2\u20134) but recent weeks (Periods 31\u201339) show lower demand; I use a recent-window forecast to capture current recent demand level and volatility (last 9 periods) so the OR base-stock balances service vs holding given large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-11-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=651 (large pipeline). Historical lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) is low and more representative of current seasonality than the early-year spike, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on current demand regime. This keeps target base-stock moderate (avoids overstocking given holding cost) while pipeline already supplies several periods of demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On-hand=0 and large in-transit=651; no recent conclude messages indicating new lead-time evidence, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has fallen to a low, stable regime (last 3 demands = 27,35,26); I use a short recent window to capture current low demand. Set L=default (promised=2). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 3 periods, and sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps inventory responsive to the current low-demand regime while avoiding overstock from the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=651 units (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2); demand history includes early high regime and many subsequent periods. To reflect observed lead-time variability I let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). Given the sizable in-transit pipeline and uncertain recent demand signal, I use default demand and volatility estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples, letting the backend balance service-level vs holding cost with observed lead-time average.

Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=651 (large pipeline). Historical lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods (avg \u22481.6) so I choose to let backend infer average lead time via 'calculate'. Recent demand (Periods 36\u201343) is lower and more stable vs earlier spike; to make the forecast responsive to current low-demand regime I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect the latest 8 weeks. Large in-transit means orders now should be conservative to avoid excess holding cost; these parameters will lower target base-stock compared with using the older high-demand samples.

Demand has a confirmed earlier regime shift (Periods 2\u20134) but recent weeks (most recent ~12 periods) show lower, variable weekly demand; use recent_N=12 to capture current regime and reduce influence of early extreme spikes. These choices let the OR backend set base-stock and cap using an L that matches observed variability and \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 estimated from recent demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.
