Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time shifts. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks: 46,33,53,37,21) show no sustained regime change. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L). This balances service level given profit/holding cost with no evidence to alter forecasts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=59 (ordered P1) and Period1 conclude showed arrived=0 for that order \u2014 not enough concluded evidence to change promised L=2 (no concluded arrival yet). Historical weekly demand samples mean=38 units; no sustained regime change detected. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This addresses potential missing arrivals conservatively by keeping promised L and standard aggregate demand estimates.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=115 (orders P1=59 + P2=56). Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet for those orders so no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipments. Historical weekly demand mean = 38 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). I use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample history while awaiting concluded arrivals to detect any lead-time or demand regime shifts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=137. Historical concluded messages show no arrivals in Periods 1\u20133 despite orders placed (P1 ordered=59, P2 ordered=56, P3 ordered=22). Promised lead time=2 but expected arrivals (e.g., P1 order should have arrived by Period3) did not occur, indicating actual lead time may be longer or shipments lost. To be conservative, set lead time explicitly to 3 periods so the OR backend increases pipeline coverage. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all historical demand samples (mean=38) \u2014 this raises target base-stock to cover the longer effective review+lead window while default volatility scaling preserves service/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed missing arrivals for 3 consecutive periods: P1 ordered=59, P2 ordered=56, P3 ordered=22 had arrived=0 by Period3 conclude \u2014 suggests actual lead time >2 or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=52, in-transit=114 (total pipeline 166). Historical weekly demand mean=38 (samples: 46,33,53,37,21). Period4 conclude shows an arrival for Period2 order with observed lead_time=2; earlier consecutive non-arrivals suggest possible lost shipments but we lack sustained new evidence to change lead time. I choose to set L via calculate (uses observed lead times \u2192 2), mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)*mean using all samples, and sigma_hat default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the OR engine aligned to observed lead time while letting it compute safety stock from full-history statistics given limited data and uncertain lost orders.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=40, in-transit=114. History shows an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead time observed = 2); some earlier orders showed missing arrivals but recent concluded arrival confirms promised lead time. Demand history (historical weekly samples mean = 38) and recent on-site demand show a downward drift but not yet a sustained regime change. To be conservative given confirmed L=2 and limited sustained demand shift, use default estimators so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This keeps service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overfitting to short recent volatility or transient lost shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=30, in-transit=114. History shows one concluded arrival indicating a 2-period lead time (Period2\u2192Period4), but several earlier orders showed delayed/missing arrivals for multiple periods. Given limited evidence of sustained lead-time shift and a confirmed 2-period arrival, use promised lead time (default) so OR backend's baseline forecast applies. Use default demand and volatility computations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the backend combine historical demand stats with promised L while preserving cap behavior. This balances service level (using established stats) against holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Observed confirmed arrival: Period4 conclude shows an order placed in Period2 arrived with lead_time=2, so no persistent lead-time change is confirmed. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=114 (sufficient pipeline). Recent demand shows one large spike (47 in Period7) but prior periods are moderate; no sustained demand regime change. Use default lead time (promised 2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all historical samples, providing a conservative forecast while the pipeline covers short-term risk and avoids excess holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand spikes (Period 7:47, Period 8:42) but historical weekly mean = 38 (samples:46,33,53,37,21). On-hand=0, in-transit=128 (covers upcoming demand). Observed arrival in Period 4 conclude shows an order placed in Period 2 arrived with lead_time=2 \u2014 we have one confirmed observed lead time=2, so set L by calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given moderate demand and available pipeline stock. No explicit inflation of demand or volatility due to single confirmed lead-time observation.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=131. History shows one confirmed observed lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4); several earlier orders experienced delayed/no arrival but only one concluded lead-time sample is available. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (uses concluded arrivals only). Demand has recent volatility (several high weeks: P7=47, P8=42) but no sustained regime change of 3+ periods; use default aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat. This balances service level (profit/holding cost ratio) while respecting uncertain/partially missing arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=114. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = {2 (P2->P4), 2 (P8->P10), 1 (P9->P10)}; some earlier orders (P1,P2,P3) were missing for multiple periods but later P2 arrived, indicating intermittent lost/delayed shipments. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures mix of 1\u20132 period outcomes). Demand history is limited and Jan samples (mean=38) remain the best stable prior; to avoid overreacting to recent volatile weeks, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain/variable arrivals and avoids chasing short noisy spikes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=126. Historical conclude messages show arrivals with lead_times observed = {P2->P4:2, P8->P10:2, P9->P10:1} and several earlier periods with missing arrivals suggesting some lost shipments but recent evidence centers around ~2 periods. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect empirical lead-time (~1.67) rather than blindly using the promise. Demand forecast uses defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, letting the OR backend compute the base-stock and cap; this balances higher service level from observed multi-period lead times against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). History shows mixed arrivals: observed concluded lead times = 2 (P2->P4), 2 (P8->P10), and 1 (P9->P10); some earlier orders (P1,P3) did not conclude and may be lost. Because concluded lead-time observations are limited but centered near 2, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses empirical average. Demand history is sparse/seasonal; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine blend long-run demand with the inferred lead time. This approach is conservative against missing shipments (we infer lead time from concluded arrivals) while avoiding overfitting to recent noisy zero-sales periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent demand has risen sharply (recent demands: 15,9,28,69,136) so I use a recent-window demand estimate. Multiple concluded arrivals show lead times of 2 periods (and one 1), so I choose to let backend calculate average observed lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the upward regime. This balances higher safety stock for elevated demand while relying on observed lead-time behavior to avoid over-ordering given past delayed/missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period2 order arrived Period4; Period8 order arrived Period10; Period11 order arrived Period13).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,1,2} (arrivals in Periods 4,10,10,13 from earlier orders) \u2014 average \u22481.75, so I request backend compute the average observed lead time. Use default demand estimates (historical sample mean) and default volatility so the OR engine applies (1+L) scaling consistently with the inferred L. This balances service level (use observed slightly <2 mean) while avoiding overfitting to recent stockouts/spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2147.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand has shifted sharply higher since Period 14 (large weekly sales: 69,136,130,115). On-hand=38 + in-transit=120 = 158 units cover near-term demand but recent regime implies much higher weekly demand going forward. Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2,2,1} (avg ~1.67); but arrivals have been consistent with promised L=2 in recent pairs. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. For demand I select recent_N with N=4 to force the forecast to reflect the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 14-17 average = 112.5). Sigma also uses recent_N N=4 to capture the higher volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during the new high-demand regime while sigma adjustment increases safety stock; this helps balance profit (high) against holding cost given current pipeline coverage.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg demand increased to 112.5 over Periods 14-17 (previous Periods 1-13 avg \u2248 21.46) \u2014 sustained 4 periods of much higher demand.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (periods 14-17 avg \u2248112.5 vs earlier \u224821.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=283 (large pipeline covers upcoming demand). Observed concluded lead times are mostly 2 periods; use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N with N=4 (periods 14-17) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Use recent_N N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher demand while backend caps protect against excessive inventory given holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 with much higher weekly demand; more recent 6 weeks (Periods 14-19) average \u224899 units/week. Lead time evidence is mixed (observed 1\u20132), but multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals earlier and several 1-period arrivals later\u2014use calculated average of observed lead times to let backend infer current effective L. On-hand =120 and in-transit=243 provide sizable coverage; choosing recent demand window (N=6) focuses mu_hat and sigma_hat on the new high-demand regime, while calculate for L captures observed variability. These choices help the OR backend size base stock for elevated demand while letting lead-time averaging mitigate occasional 1-period early arrivals and past lost shipments.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=72, in-transit=282. Historical concludes show mixed lead times but recent observed lead-time samples = [2,2,1,2,2,1,1] (avg \u22481.57). Demand regime shift at Period 14 is sustained; recent demand (Periods 14-20) = [69,136,130,115,102,43,48], regime length=7. To reflect confirmed longer-than-promised variability in lead time use calculated average lead time. To capture the post-changepoint higher demand and recent variance, use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. These choices balance service (protect against stockouts during elevated demand and variable lead time) against holding cost by limiting history to the confirmed new regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (high mean ~112.5 over P14-17) with continued elevated weekly demand (P17-P21: 115,102,43,48,60). On-hand=12, in-transit=314 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) = [2,2,1,2,2,1,1] \u2192 avg \u22481.57. To capture the confirmed regime shift and recent variability, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand over the review+lead period using recent weeks (emphasizing the higher-demand regime) while accounting for recent volatility. This balances higher service levels for the new demand regime against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times but overall average ~1.625 periods; recent arrivals at P22 (P20\u2192P22) and multiple P*=2 or 1 support using the observed-average lead time. Demand regime shifted up at Period 14 and recent weeks remain elevated and volatile (recent demands P17\u2013P22 = 115,102,43,48,60,99). To balance service vs holding cost, set L using calculated average lead time; forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent data to capture the new high-demand regime and recent volatility (use last 6 periods to estimate mean and std over the review+lead period).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=358. Historical concludes show actual lead times mostly 1\u20132 (lead time confirmed=2 at P16) though early missing arrivals occurred; pipeline is large so treat promised lead time as default. Demand shifted up starting Period 14 (sustained higher mean through Periods 14\u201324). To capture the new regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14\u201324, regime length=11). These choices let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent high-demand regime while keeping L at the promised value to avoid overreacting to earlier lost shipments.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=358. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (Periods 2\u21924, 8\u219210, 11\u219213). A demand regime shift was observed starting Period 14 (Periods 14\u201317 avg \u2248112.5). To bias orders toward the higher recent regime while keeping lead-time as the promised/confirmed value, I use L=default (promised 2). For demand I focus on the confirmed high-demand regime using recent_N with N=4 (the 4-period high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets a higher base stock and caps appropriately to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (evidence: avg \u2248112.5 over P14\u2013P17 and elevated, variable demand since). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 units (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times (multiple periods) vary {1,2,3} \u2014 average lead time should be estimated from observations rather than using the promised value. Choice: L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures mixture of 1\u20133 period arrivals). For demand, use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 14\u201326 inclusive length=13) to anchor mu_hat to the confirmed higher-demand regime and recent variability. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=13 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit volume prevents over-ordering; using recent regime-based mu/sigma balances service level vs holding cost given the pipeline and confirmed regime shift.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times (observed values: 2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,3) so I use the average observed lead time. Demand has shown a sustained higher regime since Period 14; I base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent continuous high-demand regime (Periods 14-27, N=14) so the OR engine's (1+L) scaling applies to the recent mean and std. These choices help the backend set a base stock that reflects the new higher demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed LTs: 2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,1,3; avg \u22481.67) and a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 14. On-hand=0, in-transit=355 so pipeline is large but lead-time uncertainty and elevated demand justify using observed-average lead time and recent demand stats. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times to reflect real behavior. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14\u201328, N=15) so the backend bases base-stock on current high-demand mean and recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (Periods 14-17 avg \u2248112.5) and high demand continuing through Periods 27-29 (demands 36,70,116). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 (large pipeline). Lead-time observations mostly support L=2 with occasional 1 or 3 and some earlier lost/delayed arrivals; use averaged observed lead time so backend can reconcile variability. Use recent demand window to capture the higher-demand regime (use last 4 periods from the confirmed changepoint) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock reflects elevated demand while pipeline is capped by OR engine. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 14 (sustained higher weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times center on 1\u20132 periods with prior confirmation of 2 periods; I will use promised lead time but compute demand stats from the recent high-demand regime. Chosen L=default (use promised=2) to keep OR engine assumptions aligned with contract; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 14\u201330 inclusive, regime length=17) so forecasts & variability reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and avoid underordering. This balances service (avoid stockouts during elevated demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

To capture the higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples from the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14\u201331, 18 weeks) so the OR backend sizes base stock to meet the new demand level while keeping L at the promised/default value.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (higher mean) and mixed observed lead times (some 1\u20133 periods). I set L=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the observed 1\u20133 period variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 14\u201332 regime) so mu_hat reflects the higher-demand regime: (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 19 samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=19 to capture recent volatility. This prioritizes service for the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using observed lead-time average; with large in-transit stock this avoids excessive extra ordering but preserves coverage against the elevated demand.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals confirmed Periods 26\u201332: multiple orders placed earlier did not conclude (no arrivals observed by Period32), while in-transit shows 355 units\u2014signals potential lost/delayed shipments needing monitoring.

Use calculate for L so backend averages observed lead times. Demand shows a sustained regime shift up from Period 14 onward, but to be conservative use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will scale (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) to let OR engine incorporate full history while L captures lead-time variation.

Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times but a persistent pattern of ~2 periods with occasional 1\u20133; using calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Demand exhibits a sustained regime shift beginning Period 14 (much higher weekly demand through Period 34); to capture the new regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 (capped at 20) to weight recent high-demand periods. These choices (L=calculate, recent demand window) help the OR backend size the (1+L)-period forecast to protect service during the higher-demand regime while sigma estimated from the same recent window informs safety stock vs holding cost tradeoff. No explicit adjustment for potentially lost shipments is made here (we rely on observed concluded arrivals via calculate).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 14 (periods 14\u201335 show far higher weekly demand vs Periods 1\u201313). In-transit = 355 and multiple earlier orders did not conclude on-time, but lead-time was previously confirmed as 2 in Period 16; missing arrivals since Periods 26\u201332 were noted but not yet a new sustained confirmed lead-time change. I therefore keep L as default (promised 2) so backend uses contract lead time, and I forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the most recent sustained regime (cap applied per rules) so the OR engine raises base-stock and safety stock to meet elevated demand while acknowledging holding cost via the backend's q calculation.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 14 (sustained elevated weekly demand ~100\u2013130); on-hand=0 but large in-transit=355 with several overdue/missing arrivals earlier\u2014risk of lost shipments. I keep L=default (use promised lead time=2) because concluded lead-time observations historically center on 2 and backend expects promised LT; I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use most recent 20 demand samples to reflect elevated mean and volatility). This increases target base_stock to meet higher demand while sigma from recent data raises safety stock to buffer delayed arrivals.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concludes show lead time observations of 1\u20133 periods with many 2-period arrivals and several missing/delayed shipments; recent demand regime increased starting Period 14 and has remained elevated through Period 37. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history (captures mixed 1\u20133 signals). For demand, use recent_N with N=20 to base mu_hat on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (captures elevated mean over Periods 14+). Use recent_N N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting higher current demand while letting the OR engine incorporate the empirical lead-time mix; relying on recent samples reduces understock risk given many overdue/missing arrivals while limiting excess holding cost by using a finite recent-window estimate.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 14 (many weeks with demand >> historical pre-14 levels). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 (large pipeline but prior missing arrivals observed between Periods 26\u201332). Lead-time observations in conclude messages are mixed but centered on 2 periods; to avoid overfitting to intermittent lost shipments I use the backend's lead-time estimator. I set L='calculate' so backend computes average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. For volatility I use recent_N with N=10 to match the same recent window. These choices aim to raise the backend base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while letting the backend cap limit exposure given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concludes show lead time behavior centered on 2 periods with intermittent 1\u20133 period observations and several missing arrivals earlier; recent concluded arrivals since Period16 support promised lead time. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning around Period14; recent weekly demands (Periods 20\u201339) remain elevated and more variable versus the early-sample (Periods1\u201313). To capture the recent high-demand regime and volatility, I use recent_N estimates over the most recent 20 demand samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat. I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded evidence since Period16 confirms L=2 and the OR engine expects the promised lead time.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 14 (multiple periods of 69\u2013139+ then many 30\u2013127 values), so forecast should weight recent high-demand behavior. On-hand=0 with in-transit=355; several earlier shipments were missing/delayed but Periods 2,8,11,16 evidence confirmed typical 2-period arrivals. To balance service and holding cost: keep promised lead time (no new sustained LT confirmation beyond prior notes) but use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the higher regime. I select L=default to use promised lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the most recent demand regime (capped at 20) so the OR backend sets a higher base-stock while sigma reflects recent volatility. This addresses potential lost shipments by sizing orders to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while avoiding excessive inventory given holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W samples: 2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,3 \u2192 avg \u22481.73) and multiple missing/delayed shipments earlier. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures the shorter-than-promised but variable reality). For demand forecasting I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this keeps the model anchored to full history while letting the adjusted L reflect observed transit behavior. This balances service (using observed lead time to size pipeline) against holding cost given large in-transit position that may or may not arrive.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concluces show lead time has been variable (confirmed 2 in Period16) but multiple missing/delayed arrivals since Period26 and a large in-transit balance that has not concluded\u2014risk of longer/uncertain lead time or lost shipments. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period14 (avg \u2248112.5 over P14\u201317) but recent weekly demands (most recent 7 concluded periods P36\u2013P42 = [51,87,81,33,16,13,14]) show lower and volatile demand; I use a conservative longer lead time estimate to avoid under-ordering against in-transit uncertainty, and base demand forecast on the most recent 7 weeks to capture current lower/volatile regime. Therefore: L set explicit=3 (accounts for observed delays beyond promised 2); mu_hat use recent_N with N=7 to compute (1+L)*mean of last 7 samples; sigma_hat use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (longer L to allow for delayed arrivals) with holding cost by using short recent window for demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand returned to low levels (Periods 39\u201343: 33,16,13,14,10) after a mid-year high (Periods 14\u201320). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 but history shows many delayed/missing arrivals (Periods 26\u201332 missing). I choose L by averaging observed concluded lead times to reflect empirical delivery performance (captures some 1\u20133 period outcomes) so the OR engine will size orders recognizing occasional faster arrivals but also delays. For demand parameters I use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7overall mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7overall std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given low recent demand and significant in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concluded lead times show multiple 1\u20133 period observations (avg ~1.73); promised=2 but concluded data is informative so use calculated average. Demand shifted up beginning Period 14 and remained elevated; to capture the new regime I use recent_N for demand forecast and volatility, using the max cap of 20 most recent concluded samples to reflect persistent higher demand while smoothing older low-demand data. These choices let the OR backend increase the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while the calculated L incorporates observed lead-time behavior from concluded arrivals.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (avg \u2248112.5 over P14\u2013P17) and consistently elevated weekly demand since then. On-hand=0, in-transit=355 units (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2; recent concluded arrivals confirm lead time=2 in multiple earlier periods and no new confirmed change. I set L to default (promised=2) to keep OR engine assumptions aligned with supplier promise. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise (regime length since P14 is >20). Sigma uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices aim to size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while letting the large in-transit pipeline reduce new ordering, balancing service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost risk.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=355 (large pipeline). Historical demand shows an earlier sustained regime shift to higher demand around Periods 14\u201317, but more recent 13 periods (P34\u2013P46) average demand has settled near ~39 units/week with moderate variability. Many past shipments were delayed/lost but lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods in prior evidence; pipeline is large so use promised lead time. To keep orders aligned with recent realized demand and avoid excess holding cost, I use recent_N over the most recent 13 periods for mean and volatility (captures current seasonality/variability), and default lead time (promised=2). These parameters let the OR backend compute base_stock tuned to recent demand while capping order sizes to limit holding cost given the large in-transit quantity.
