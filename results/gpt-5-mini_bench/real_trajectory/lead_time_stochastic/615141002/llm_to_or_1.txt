Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples through 2019-02-04) shows mean ~114.6 units/week and no evidence of a regime change or delayed shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need normal replenishment. Promised lead time is 2 and there are no concluded arrivals to suggest a different actual lead time. I therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost under current steady demand evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=158 from Period 1 order which has not concluded (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time yet; shipment is overdue relative to promised L=2 but not confirmed lost. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 .. 2019-02-04) show mean ~114.6. Given limited new evidence and equal profit/holding ($1 each) I use the default (promised) lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance, avoiding premature regime changes based on a single overdue shipment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u2248114.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=312 (sum of P1+P2 orders). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet; this is consistent with promised L=2 because orders placed in P1/P2 will arrive during P3/P4 and only be visible in later conclude messages. I therefore keep L at default (promised=2). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this produces a base-stock that balances the 50% profit vs holding cost tradeoff and lets the OR backend account for demand variability. The in-transit 312 slightly undercovers the (1+L)*mean (~344), so the backend will top up toward the computed base-stock while capping orders per its cap rule.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand (Jan) averaged ~114.6 but the last 3 concluded periods show a sustained lower regime (Period1-3 demands = 79, 84, 71; avg=78). On-hand=0, in-transit=316 but no arrivals recorded for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (ordered 158,154,4) \u2014 suggests delayed or lost shipments and possible effective lead time > promised 2. I set L explicitly to 3 to be conservative against the observed shipment delays. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the recently observed lower-demand regime (this reduces overordering while the shipment situation resolves). These choices prioritize avoiding excess holding given profit=holding cost and the apparent drop in demand, while accounting for delayed arrivals by lengthening lead time.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (total ordered=316) have not arrived by Period 4 conclude; sustained absence over 3 periods suggests lead time >2 or lost/delayed shipments.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
615141002: ordered=0, arrived=154 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=154, demand=509, sold=154, ending on-hand inventory=0

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent history shows a dramatic demand spike in Period 4 (509 units) vs prior weekly demand ~70\u2013150. Concluded arrivals show the Period 2 order arrived with lead_time=2; Period 1 (158 units) and Period 3 (4 units) remain in-transit (total 162) but the Period 1 shipment is overdue (>3 periods missing) and likely lost/delayed. On-hand=0, in-transit=162. To respond to the large observed demand spike while keeping sensitivity to recent data, I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (which confirms 2). For demand I select recent_N with N=3 to emphasize the most recent regime including the spike (uses last 3 demand samples: Periods 2\u20134 = 84, 71, 509) so the backend will size base stock for the new higher mean. For volatility I also choose recent_N N=3 to reflect increased variance. These choices increase target inventory to recover service after the demand surge while L=calculate prevents assuming longer/shorter lead time without more evidence.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4); Order from Period 1 (158 units) still missing as of Period 4 conclude (overdue by >1 promised lead_time) \u2014 likely lost or severely delayed.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized demand has jumped (Period 4=509, Period 5=595) versus historical weekly mean ~114.6, but the high-demand regime is not yet 3+ periods sustained. On-hand=0, in-transit=664 (large pipeline including overdue/lost earlier orders). Observed lead time evidence: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 => lead time = 2. To balance service vs holding cost: set L by calculated observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=2); use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to bias the forecast toward the recent high demand while still retaining historical weight; use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the recent rise in demand variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $46.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-25. On-hand=228, in-transit=836; recent arrivals show actual lead time variability (observed W=2 and W=1). Several earlier orders absent for multiple periods suggesting some lost/delayed shipments; pipeline still large. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times average (captures recent 2 and 1 period observations). Demand has clearly shifted up: last 3 periods demands = {509,595,274} vs historical weekly mean ~114.6. I therefore use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand from the most recent regime and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture increased volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand regime while the calculated L captures lead-time variability and the recent-N volatility prevents over/under-ordering given overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 4: recent avg = 459.3 (Periods 4-6) vs historical avg = 114.6 (+300%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand spike observed starting Period 4 (Periods 4-6 avg=459.3 vs historical avg=114.6) but Period 7 dropped to 86 so demand is volatile. Inventory: on-hand=142, in-transit=1150. Historical concluded lead times: Period2 order -> arrived in Period4 (LT=2); Period5 order -> arrived in Period6 (LT=1) => average observed LT=1.5. One early shipment (Period1, 158 units) remains missing and likely lost. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use average observed lead time (captures varied L=1 and 2). For demand, I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the confirmed elevated regime (Periods 4-6) while limiting influence from the single low Period 7. This balances service (capture spike) vs holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=1018, in-transit=162. Historical concluded lead times observed = {2,1,2,1} (avg 1.5) and there was a prior lost/overdue shipment (Period 1 still missing). Demand surged in Periods 4-6 but softened in 7-8; to be responsive to recent actual demand we use a short recent window. Choose L by calculating average of observed lead times to let the backend account for mixed realized LT. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the last 5 demand observations (Periods 4-8) so forecasts capture the recent elevated but variable demand pattern while avoiding overcommitment given some shipments were lost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=937, in-transit=162; prior history shows lead times observed = [2,1,2,1] (arrivals in Periods 4,6,8) and a demand regime shift beginning Period 4 (high demand in Periods 4-6). Recent demand (Periods 4-9) = [509,595,274,86,112,81], mean=276.17. I use recent observed lead times to estimate L (average of last 4 observed lead times = 1.5) via recent_N to capture mixed 1\u20132 period behavior. For demand I use recent_N N=6 to capture the post-changepoint elevated mean while including recent softening; mu_hat and sigma_hat use the last 6 demand samples so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level given high on-hand inventory versus holding cost. This keeps replenishment responsive to true short lead times seen recently while reflecting the elevated demand regime that started in Period 4.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand is 890, in-transit 162. Historical concluded lead times observed: P4 (P2\u2192P4)=2, P6 (P5\u2192P6)=1, P8 (P6\u2192P8)=2, P8 (P7\u2192P8)=1 \u2192 average ~1.5. Recent demand has fallen from the large spike (P4-6) to much lower weekly demand (P8-10 = 112, 81, 47). Given large on-hand position and recent lower demand, set lead time to the calculated average to reflect observed behavior, but forecast demand using the most recent 3 weeks to avoid over-ordering. Sigma should match recent volatility over those same 3 weeks. These choices steer the OR backend to reduce new receipts while covering the near-term (L+1) demand and limit holding cost given current heavy inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W = 2,1,2,1); average of last 4 observed lead times = 1.5, so I use recent_N for L to capture shorter effective pipeline. Current on-hand is very high (860) with 162 in-transit and recent realized demand has dropped (Periods 8-11 average ~67.5), so I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at default (use full-sample estimates) to avoid overstating demand from the transient spike in Periods 4-6. Defaults give the OR engine a conservative forecast while L=recent_N(4) lets it adjust order timing to the observed mixed lead-time pattern and avoid unnecessary additional orders given high on-hand inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=812, in-transit=162. Historical concluded lead times: observed {2,1,2,1} (avg=1.5) so I set L to be calculated from observed history. Demand regime: spike in Periods 4-6 was transient; recent demand (Periods 8-12 = 112,81,47,30,48) is much lower (mean ~63.6). To avoid unnecessary replenishment given large on-hand, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts low near-term demand and low volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding holding cost while maintaining service for current low-demand regime.

Demand regime shift since Period 4 (sustained higher demand through Periods 4-13); use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the new regime (captures periods 4\u201313). These choices ensure the OR engine sizes base stock to cover the elevated recent demand while the calculated L captures shorter/variable observed lead times; using recent data for volatility reduces under/overstock risk given the regime change.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=734, in-transit=162. Earlier sustained surge (Periods 4-6) was a short regime; since Period 8 demand has stabilized much lower (Periods 8-14 demands = [112,81,47,30,48,35,43], recent mean \u224856.6). Lead-time evidence from concludes shows typical actual LT = 1\u20132 but confirmed 2 earlier; no new sustained LT change. I choose L=default (use promised LT=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to focus the forecast on the stable post-spike regime (N=7 equals available recent post-spike samples Periods 8\u201314). For sigma I also use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine to size base-stock to current lower demand, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service given current pipeline.

On-hand=681, in-transit=162 (total pipeline=843) is ample vs recent demand. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); use calculated average lead time. Set demand forecast using recent sample window covering the stable low-demand regime (Periods 8\u201315, N=8) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower demand and limit excess holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Current on-hand=645, in-transit=162. Historical concluded lead times observed = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5). Recent demand has returned to a low regime (recent periods demand ~35-53). There remain missing/overdue early shipments (Period 1 order still not concluded) so I avoid assuming longer lead times than observed. Set L to 'calculate' to use the average observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (reduces mu_hat and sigma_hat vs. the short high-demand spike), and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock tight to lower holding cost while reflecting the confirmed recent lower demand and not over-ordering against possibly lost early shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift reversed: avg demand dropped from 459.3 (Periods 4-6) to 43.0 (Periods 12-16), sustained for 5 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has returned to the low regime observed in Periods 12-17 (recent 5-period mean \u2248 38.8 units/week). On-hand=618, in-transit=162 \u2014 ample cover for near-term demand; no new missing-shipment evidence since Period 6. Lead-time observations (concluded): mix of 1 and 2 periods (observed lead_times = 2,1,2,1) -> average \u22481.5; I use the calculated average. For demand I use a recent_N=5 estimate to reflect the post-regime drop (N=5 covers Periods 13-17) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent demand has settled into the low regime observed since Period 12 (periods 12-18 avg \u2248 38.4 units/week). Current position: on-hand=591, in-transit=162 (sufficient to cover several weeks of current low demand). Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times (observed LT = 2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5); there was a previously missing/likely-lost order (Period 1) but later shipments confirmed lead times of 1\u20132. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend average) to let it reflect the 1\u20132 period reality. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 12\u201318) to capture the sustained low-demand regime; sigma_hat also recent_N N=7 to reflect lower recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend target inventory for the current low-demand regime while the calculated L accounts for the empirically observed shorter/variable lead times and avoids over-ordering against historic spikes.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=558, in-transit=162 \u2014 ample cover vs current demand; one earlier large order appears lost but recent lead-time observations show both 1 and 2 periods. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (backend will compute ~1.5). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 12\u201319) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent via recent_N.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand is in the low regime that began around Period 12 (Periods 12\u201320 demand samples show sustained low demand). On-hand=545, in-transit=162; ample inventory to meet current low demand so avoid aggressive replenishment. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1] \u2192 average 1.5; use calculated average. For demand I use a recent_N forecast to reflect the low-demand regime (use last 9 concluded demand samples, Periods 12\u201320). Sigma uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices reduce ordering given low demand and high on-hand, while accounting for mixed observed lead times.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 12 (10 samples, mean=33.5 units/week). On-hand=525, in-transit=162 \u2014 ample cover for current low demand; no arrivals are overdue in the concluded history (recent arrivals show mixed lead times). I set L to recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent observed lead-time variability (observed lead_times = 2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 12\u201321) to reflect the sustained low-demand regime: mu_hat based on the (1+L)\xd7mean of these 10 samples. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the current low-demand regime while the recent_N lead time captures shorter-than-promised arrivals and some variability, reducing excess ordering risk given high holding cost (holding = profit).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=464, in-transit=162. Historical concluded lead times: observed = {2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8)} \u2192 average ~1.5. Early-season demand samples mean=114.6 and recent periods show low steady demand; inventory is ample. To balance service vs holding (profit=holding), use averaged observed lead time so pipeline coverage reflects real arrivals and use default demand estimates from full sample set to avoid overreacting to short recent dips. Methods chosen: L by calculate (average observed lead times), mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps base-stock anchored to long-run demand while accounting for realized lead-time behavior and avoids aggressive ordering given high on-hand inventory and equal holding/profit costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 12 (sustained ~13\u201334 units/week); on-hand=443, in-transit=162. Observed concluded lead times (from arrive messages) are {2,1,2,1} \u2192 average ~1.5; earlier missing shipments likely lost but more recent arrivals align with ~1\u20132 periods. To reflect recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (capture last 13 periods P12\u2013P24). I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on current low-volatility demand and avoids overstocking from early high-demand spikes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=401, in-transit=162. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4), 1 (P6), 2 (P8), 1 (P8) \u2192 variability around 1\u20132; use calculated average lead time to capture this. Demand shifted high in Periods 4\u20136 then reverted to a lower regime from Period 12 onward (Periods 12\u201325 show consistently lower weekly demand); use recent samples from the low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overstock. Methods chosen: L=calculate to reflect observed average lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=14 to base (1+L)-period demand on the recent low-demand regime (Periods 12\u201325); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=14 to capture recent demand volatility. These settings reduce ordering for the current low-demand regime while accounting for actual lead-time variability and avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has remained in the low regime since Period 12\u201316 reversal (avg ~30\u2013 Forty); current on-hand=364, in-transit=162, so pipeline provides coverage. Observed concluded lead-times have varied (1 and 2); use backend 'calculate' to average observed lead times for L. Demand forecast uses recent data to reflect the low-demand regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N over the last 10 periods to capture current mean and volatility (N=10 covers Periods 17\u201326). These choices keep base-stock responsive to the sustained low-demand regime while the backend caps ordering to limit holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been low and stable since Period 12 (weeks 12-27 avg \u2248 36 units/week); current on-hand=313 and in-transit=162 provide ample coverage. No new confirmed lead-time change or lost-shipment pattern since prior insights. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=16 (Periods 12-27) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower mean/volatility. Keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded arrivals still support the previous confirmation and there is no new sustained evidence to change it. These choices reduce excess ordering under the low-demand regime while preserving service given plentiful on-hand inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been low and stable since Period 17 (recent five-week avg \u224835 units) after earlier spikes and a reversed regime. On-hand=287, in-transit=162 \u2014 ample short-term cover vs recent demand (~449 units stock+pipeline covers ~ (1+L)*mean). Observed concluded lead times include 2,1,2,1 (average \u22481.5) so use calculated average lead time to reflect mixed 1\u20132 behavior. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast to the low recent regime (captures current mean/volatility), preventing overordering given holding cost equal to profit. These parameters reduce risk from earlier lost/delayed shipments by relying on recent realized demand and observed lead-time average rather than long-ago high-demand samples.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has stayed low since the regime reversal (Periods 12-29); last 6 demands = [21,42,37,51,26,45], mean \u224837.0. On-hand=242 + in-transit=162 gives pipeline=404, adequate for (1+L) periods but some historical shipments were delayed/lost. Use calculate for L so backend averages observed concluded lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 period variability). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (most relevant recent data) and to reduce overweighting the earlier high-demand spike. These choices prioritize avoiding excess holding given profit=holding cost, while letting the OR engine set service-level via its safety-stock formula.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=192, in-transit=162. Historical concluded lead times observed = {2,1,2,1} (avg 1.5), and demand regime reverted to lower sustained rates starting ~Period 12 (avg \u224843 over Periods 12-16 and continued low through Period 30). Several early orders remain missing (Period 1 order still never concluded) so we avoid assuming longer persistent lead time beyond observed arrivals. I set L by calculate to use the average of observed lead times (captures variability 1\u20132). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=19 to target the current low-demand regime (use last 19 demand samples since the regime change is sustained), so the OR backend will size base stock to current lower demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=19 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices reduce over-ordering given holding cost equals profit and account for observed mixed lead times without overcorrecting for lost early shipments.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=116, in-transit=162. Historical concluded lead times (most recent arrivals) = [2,1,2,1] => average 1.5; shipments earlier flagged lost but later arrivals confirm mixed 1\u20132 periods. Recent demand has been low/stable (last 5 weeks demands = 51,26,45,50,76; mean\u224849.6) after the regime reversal. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding => q=0.5 => moderate service target), I use a recent average lead time (captures current 1\u20132 period behaviour) and base stock sized from the most recent 5 weeks of demand to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding. Sigma uses the same recent 5-week window to capture recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=41 + In-transit=162 = 203 units. Promised lead time=2 (use default since concluded history confirms 2-period arrivals). Recent demand has settled below the earlier spike; last 5 weeks demand = [26,45,50,76,75], mean \u224854.4. With (1+L)=3 review+lead periods, using recent_N N=5 captures the current low-demand regime while remaining responsive to slight upward moves. Pipeline+on-hand (~203) covers ~3.7 periods at this recent mean, so no emergency refill required. Profit=holding -> service target moderate; recent_N for sigma aligns variability with the same window.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent demand regime returned to low baseline after earlier spike; latest 10-period demand shows modest weekly demand with one recent stockout-driven spike (Period 33=186). On-hand=0, in-transit=162 \u2014 pipeline partially covers upcoming demand but not excessive. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1}; use averaged lead time to let backend reflect observed variability. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts on the current low-demand regime while still capturing recent variability (including the stockout spike). These settings keep base_stock responsive to the current lower mean (reducing holding cost) but retain enough safety stock for variability. No explicit adjustment for lost Period 1 shipment here because concluded history already used in lead-time calc.

Demand has returned to the lower post-regime level after earlier spikes; recent 5 periods (P30-P34: demands 50,76,75,186,108) used to capture current short-term pattern while letting OR backend compute base_stock. Use promised lead time (default) since lead time previously confirmed as 2 and recent arrivals align with that. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect current demand regime; keep sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (cover short-term variability) vs holding cost given profit=holding=1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=297. Historical concluded lead-time evidence shows observed lead time around 2 (confirmed earlier) and no new sustained lead-time shift; use promised/default L. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P31-35 demands = 76,75,186,108,71) better reflects current regime than the full historical sample, so forecast (1+L)\xd7mean using recent_N=5. Volatility similarly set from the same recent window (captures recent variability including one spike at 186). Parameters chosen to align base-stock with current demand regime while the in-transit 297 units will be compared by the OR engine against pipeline; this avoids overreacting to older regime spikes and limits excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent history shows observed lead times of 1 and 2 periods (arrivals in conclude messages), so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer typical delivery delay. On-hand=24 and in-transit=196 \u2014 pipeline sizable but some earlier orders were overdue/lost in P1 (still missing) so rely on concluded lead-time evidence rather than assuming all in-transit will arrive. Demand has normalized after prior regime shifts; use recent 5-week demand to capture current demand level (~106/week) and recent volatility. Chosen methods: L=calculate to average observed lead times; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)-period demand using last 5 demands; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture recent variability. These settings balance service (using up-to-date lead time and recent demand to avoid stockouts) against holding cost by not inflating safety stock from older high-demand spikes.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=294. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed 2,1,2,1,1 \u2192 avg ~1.4) but no sustained shift away from promised 2; some shipments have arrived with 1-2 period leads and some earlier long delays were resolved. Demand has returned to the lower post-regime levels over many periods. I choose L by averaging observed lead times (backend will compute the average) to reflect realized shorter-than-promised shipments while remaining adaptive. I select default demand statistics (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses full historical mean/variance scaled by (1+L); this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding (critical ratio 0.5). With in-transit=294 and L set to the observed-average, the backend capped ordering will avoid excessive new orders while covering expected (L+1)-period demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent demand recovered from mid-year low: last 5 demands (Periods 34-38) = [108,71,90,105,119], recent mean ~98.6 which is materially above the long-run mean (114.6 from initial history is inflated by early data; recent pattern shows ~100/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=196 (covers ~2 weeks at recent demand). Observed concluded lead times in history have trended to 1 period in the most recent arrivals (Periods 36 and 38 arrivals had lead_time=1). Therefore I set L using recent lead-time evidence to favor the shorter recent lead time while remaining responsive. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 5-week window to capture the current demand regime (avoids overweighting earlier anomalous spikes and the low mid-year regime). These choices aim to keep base-stock aligned to ~(1+L)*recent mean so the OR engine orders to cover the near-term demand surge while using a short recent lead time to avoid overordering given holding cost parity with profit (profit=$1, holding=$1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=283. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W = 2,1,2,1,1,1,3); recent demand rose starting Period 33 (samples P33\u2013P39 show higher demand). To capture current lead-time variability use the averaged observed lead time; to capture the recent higher-demand regime use recent_N on the most recent changepoint (Periods 33\u201339, 7 samples). These settings guide the OR backend to raise the review+lead forecast while reflecting observed lead-time uncertainty.

Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133 periods); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 33\u201340) is materially higher than the early-Jan baseline and more representative of current sales \u2014 use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align forecast and variability to the latest regime.

Recent demand (Periods 37\u201341 = 105,119,60,61,66) reflects current lower-to-moderate weekly demand; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility and avoid overweighting early 2019 spike periods. These settings balance service (by sizing to recent demand and inferred lead time) against holding cost given profit=holding, letting OR compute z and cap accordingly.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent single-period spike (Period 42 demand=231) but no sustained change; on-hand=0, in-transit=217. Historical conclude messages show varied actual lead times (1\u20133 periods) and occasional lost/delayed shipments earlier; therefore use calculated average lead time to let backend infer current effective L from observed arrivals. Demand has reverted to lower regime since Period 17; no strong evidence to override historical sample-based demand parameters, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service (by letting L reflect observed variability) against holding cost by not inflating forecast from a single spike.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed = [2,1,2,1,1,1,3,2,3], avg\u22481.78), so I set L to the calculated average to reflect actual carrier behavior rather than the promised 2. Recent demand (Periods 39-43 = [60,61,66,231,62], mean=96) is more representative than the long-ago Jan samples and captures the recent spike at Period 42; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the latest regime. This balances service (accounting for observed lead-time variability and recent demand) against holding costs by avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand data while still using a small sample to limit extreme overreaction to a single spike.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16): on-hand=0, in-transit=288. Recent concluded lead times vary (observed = {2,1,2,1,1,1,3,2,3}, avg\u22481.78) indicating variability around the promised 2-period lead time; several past shipments showed delays but most arrivals fit 1\u20133 periods. Demand has no new sustained regime shift since Period 17. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect realized variability. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample statistics) because there is no new sustained demand regime change: this avoids overreacting to short December spikes (one large demand at P42). With L estimated from observations, the OR backend will size base stock to cover the longer effective pipeline while default demand stats prevent over-ordering for transient spikes. Current pipeline (288) plus orders placed will be compared against (1+L)-period demand by the backend.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent weeks show moderate demand (last 6 weeks: 61,66,231,62,45,68) with no sustained new regime; existing carry-over insights (prior regime shifts and confirmed LT=2 from Period 2\u21924) remain relevant. On-hand=0, in-transit=220 \u2014 sufficient to cover upcoming demand for a short window but some past orders were delayed/lost, so infer lead time from observed concludes rather than promised. I choose L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (captures variable/occasionally multi-period shipments). For demand parameters I select default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given no clear new sustained demand regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-30 (Period 47). Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20133 periods); use calculate so backend averages observed lead times. On-hand=0, in-transit=278 \u2014 with L set from observed history the pipeline (278) will be evaluated vs (1+L)\xd7forecast by OR. Demand history includes large spikes earlier but has returned to lower weekly rates for many periods; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample base) so the OR engine applies full historical mean/variance and the capped ordering rule. This choice avoids overreacting to past short spikes while letting the backend adjust base_stock using profit/holding tradeoff.
