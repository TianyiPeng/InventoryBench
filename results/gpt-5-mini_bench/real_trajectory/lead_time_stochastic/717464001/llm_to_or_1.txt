Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples show low-mid twenties with two high weeks (2019-01-21:99, 2019-01-28:72) that may be anomalous given small sample size (5 weeks). No concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviation. To be conservative, use promised lead time and aggregate-demand defaults so the OR engine uses the full sample set for mean/variance; this avoids overreacting to the apparent spike while covering (1+L) review+lead demand.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent observed demand samples (historic weeks: 18,20,99,72,68) imply average weekly demand ~55.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=114 (order placed Period 1) and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 this matches the promised lead time of 2 periods (arrival will occur during Period 3 and be visible in a later conclude). No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift (only one outstanding order within expected window). I therefore keep L at default (promised), and use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (covers current+L periods) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded periods show no arrivals yet for orders placed in P1/P2; in-transit=256 equals ordered(114+142) so shipments not confirmed lost but actual lead time cannot be inferred (no 'arrived' conclude). Historical weekly demand samples mean\u224855.4 (2019-01-07..2019-02-04). Promised lead time = 2 kept (no evidence to change). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples; this provides a neutral baseline (covers current + L future weeks) while avoiding overreaction to short-run noise and delayed conclude messages.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=0, in-transit=343 (orders placed P1=114, P2=142, P3=87) but no concluded arrivals in Periods 1-3. Promised lead time=2, yet orders placed in P1-P3 have not concluded by P3, indicating actual lead time is longer or shipments delayed/lost. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delay (orders placed in P1 should have arrived by P3 but did not). Demand history (five samples: 18,20,99,72,68) yields mean \u224855.4; I use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)*mean using all samples, letting OR engine scale demand for the longer lead+review period. I use sigma_hat default so backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This approach addresses missing arrivals by increasing the coverage window (L=3) while keeping demand estimates grounded in full historical samples to avoid overreacting to recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed delayed arrivals: orders placed P1(114), P2(142), P3(87) have 0 arrivals in conclude messages through Period 3 \u2192 actual lead time appears \u22653 periods or shipments delayed/lost.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
717464001: ordered=126, arrived=142 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=142, demand=171, sold=142, ending on-hand inventory=0

Daily Reward (R_t): $568.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (orders from P1,P3,P4); P2 arrival (142) confirmed in Period 4 conclude => observed lead_time=2 for P2. Recent demand (P1-P4)=133,185,143,171 (mean=158), substantially above historical Jan samples. Given higher recent demand and confirmed lead time=2, I set L via calculate to use observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher-demand regime. This preserves service (profit/holding q=0.8 => high fill target) while the OR engine will cap orders; using recent data avoids understocking from older low-demand samples. I also account for missing arrivals (P1 and P3 still not concluded) by keeping recent demand-driven forecasts rather than diluting with old low-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 ordered on Period 2 arrived Period 4); P1(114) and P3(87) remain unarrived by Period 4 and are likely lost/delayed.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=510. Historical arrivals show one confirmed lead time of 2 periods (P2 ordered P2 arrived P4); P1 and P3 orders never concluded and appear lost/delayed. I therefore treat actual lead time as 2 (use calculated average of observed lead times) while acknowledging missing shipments. Demand history (samples from Jan\u2013Feb) provides the forecast basis; to avoid overfitting to recent gaps caused by lost shipments, I use the default demand and volatility rules ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base_stock from the full sample set. This balances service (use confirmed L=2) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-03-25 (P7). Recent concluded history shows mixed lead times: observed lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4) and lead_time=1 (P5\u2192P6); P1 and P3 shipments remain unarrived (likely lost). On-hand=90, in-transit=327. Demand has downtrended in recent periods (P4=171, P5=132, P6=93). To balance service vs holding cost I set lead time estimate from the most recent observed lead times (average of last 2 observed leads) and base demand estimates on the most recent demand regime (last 3 periods) so the OR backend targets inventory for the current shorter/variable lead environment and recent lower demand.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=17, in-transit=363. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times recently (observed W=2 for P2->P4 and W=1 for P5->P6) and some earlier orders (P1,P3) never concluded -> possible lost shipments but recent confirmed lead times average shorter than promised. Demand has shifted from very high early-period peaks to a declining recent run (P4..P7 = 171,132,93,73); I use a short recent window to capture this downward regime. Choices: L by recent_N N=2 to reflect recent observed lead-time variability (1 and 2); mu_hat recent_N N=4 to base forecast on the last four demand periods (captures recent decline); sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These settings reduce exposure to holding costs given falling demand while keeping safety for lead-time variability.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Observed concluded lead times vary: P2->P4 was 2, P5->P6 was 1, P7->P8 was 1; some early orders (P1,P3) never concluded (likely lost). Demand has declined from earlier peaks; last 5 concluded demands (P4\u2013P8 = 171,132,93,73,74) average ~108.6. To balance service vs holding cost given uncertain but recently shorter lead times, I set L using recent observed lead times (average of last 3 observed) to capture variability, and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 demand periods to reflect the recent lower-demand regime. This keeps target base-stock responsive to recent demand while limiting excess inventory if some in-transit shipments are delayed/lost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: P2->P4 (2), P5->P6 (1), P7->P8 (1) \u2192 evidence average observed lead time ~1.33. Pipeline=388, on-hand=0; several early orders (P1,P3) never concluded and appear lost/delayed, so I avoid trusting promised L=2 solely. I set L method to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 period behavior). Demand has shifted down from early peaks (Periods 1-4) to lower mid-levels since Period 5; I use recent_N (N=5, last 5 demands P5\u2013P9 = 132,93,73,74,133) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new lower regime. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the recent lower demand while the calculated L accounts for observed faster arrivals and mitigates risk from lost older shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed = [2,1,1,2,1] periods) and some earlier lost/delayed shipments; current on-hand=0, in-transit=327 (large pipeline). I choose to infer lead time from observed concluded arrivals (calculate) to capture the shorter recent average rather than blindly use promised 2. Demand samples (historical weekly data) will be used by default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L) scaling consistently. This balances service (use observed shorter avg lead time) against holding cost given a sizable in-transit inventory and volatile past demand.

To reflect observed variable lead time I let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). Demand has shifted vs. the early 2019 samples; I use the most recent 5 demand periods (Periods 7\u201311: 73,74,133,100,56) to capture current regime for the review+lead demand forecast (recent_N, N=5). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward current realized demand and variability while relying on backend lead-time averaging to cope with mixed/occasionally lost shipments.

History shows variable actual lead times (observed concluded lead_times = [2,1,1,2,1] \u2192 avg\u22481.4) and some earlier lost shipments (P1,P3 never concluded). To hedge variability and lost arrivals I let the backend infer an empirical lead time average (calculate) and use default demand/statistics so the OR engine applies full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This preserves robustness to mixed 1\u20132 period realized lead times while letting the OR cap limit over-ordering given holding cost. No explicit manual inflation of mu/sigma to avoid overreacting to irregular lost orders.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed: [2,1,1,2,1,2] \u2192 avg 1.5); recent arrivals mostly 1\u20132 periods. Demand history (P1\u2013P13) shows recent mean higher than the early seed samples; last 6 demands = [74,133,100,56,89,75] (mean\u224887.83). I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to let the backend use empirical lead-time. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). For sigma I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (using recent demand and observed lead times) against holding cost given current zero on-hand and large in-transit volume; using recent stats avoids overreacting to early outliers and lets the OR engine cap orders per its formula.

Historical concluded lead times: P4 showed P2 order lead_time=2; P6 P5=1; P8 P7=1; P10 P8=2, P9=1; P13 P11=2 \u2192 observed lead times = [2,1,1,2,1,2], average=1.5. Several earlier orders never concluded (possible lost shipments) so I avoid assuming longer persistent lead time. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' to apply (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples (keeps forecast anchored to historical demand while letting backend cap orders).

Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20132 periods; some earlier shipments lost/delayed). Recent concluded lead times are mixed, so use recent_N for L to capture short variability. Recent demand (Periods 11\u201315: 56,89,75,100,84) shows a stable ~81 mean with moderate volatility; use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the current higher-demand regime while reflecting observed short lead-time variability and avoiding overcommitment given some lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=355. Historical concluded lead times (observed arrivals): {2,1,1,2,1,2} -> avg=1.5. Some early orders (P1,P3) appear lost, but recent concluded lead times alternate 1\u20132 with mean ~1.5. To let the OR backend compute base_stock using empirical lead-time behavior, set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand across (1+L) periods from full sample history; this keeps forecasts anchored to all available demand data while letting lead-time estimate reflect observed variability and recent mixed 1\u20132-period arrivals. This balances service (captures longer effective lead time via calculate) against holding costs by not inflating demand volatility with ad-hoc explicit values.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1\u20132 periods with recent confirmations of 2; some earlier orders were lost/delayed but recent arrivals (P15\u2192P17) support a short lead-time regime. Demand has increased in recent weeks versus earlier samples; to react to the recent higher demand while keeping safety for lead-time uncertainty, I set L using a recent average of observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 period behavior), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand (last 5 periods) to reflect the newer demand regime and its volatility. These choices bias orders upward to reduce stockouts given elevated recent demand and mixed/unstable arrivals while the OR backend will compute service-level z using profit=4 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime increase from Period 13\u201317: last 5-period avg demand = 112 (Periods 13\u201317: 75,100,84,103,198) vs earlier multi-period average \u2248 ~80; sustained higher demand observed over 4+ periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=409. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20132) and some lost/delayed orders earlier, but lead time recently centers near the promised 2 periods; I therefore keep L as default (promised=2) to match OR engine assumptions. Demand has recently shifted up: Periods 13\u201317 five-period avg = 112 (75,100,84,103,198) vs earlier ~80 \u2014 I will use a recent-5 demand estimate to capture the higher regime. Volatility also appears elevated recently, so use recent-5 for sigma. These choices (L=default, mu_hat recent_5, sigma_hat recent_5) give the backend a forecast reflecting the new higher demand while relying on promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting for reported but intermittent shipment losses; this balances service level (capture higher demand) against holding cost by restricting updates to a recent window rather than all history.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24): On-hand=0, In-transit=337. Recent history shows a sustained demand increase since Periods 13\u201317 (5-period avg \u2248112 vs earlier \u224880) and variable but mostly 1\u20132 period lead times with some lost shipments earlier. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed concluded lead times (captures variable 1\u20132 pattern). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat (focuses forecast on most recent 5 observed demands) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to improve service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping cap limits in place to control over-ordering given past lost/delayed shipments.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has risen (Periods 13\u201317 75,100,84,103,198; 5-period avg\u2248112). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline from prior orders). Historical concluded lead times = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1] (avg 1.5). Some earlier orders were lost/delayed but recent arrivals show mix of 1\u20132 periods. To balance higher recent demand while avoiding excess holding: set L using observed average lead time (calculate) so backend uses empirical lead time; set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime; set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This ensures the OR engine targets service for the new demand level while the calculated L reduces risk from assuming promised lead time if actual differs.

Recent history shows variable lead times (1\u20132) with some earlier lost/delayed shipments but recent arrivals consistent; demand has been elevated vs long-run with short-run variability. I keep L as promised (default=2) because concluded arrivals recently match 1\u20132 and promise remains 2; using default prevents overreacting to isolated lost shipments. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (Periods 18\u201322 demands = 102,107,59,124,90 -> recent mean \u224896) so mu_hat reflects the most recent demand level over the review+lead horizon. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This combination balances service (captures recent higher demand) while avoiding over-ordering due to older isolated spikes or lost shipments; with on-hand+in-transit=342 the backend cap will limit any excessive ordering.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=337. Recent demand elevated vs earlier baseline; last 5 realized weekly demands (Periods 19\u201323) avg \u2248100.4, supporting a higher forecast than long-run mean. Lead times have varied; recent concluded lead times (last 5) average \u22481.6 periods. I select recent_N for L to reflect the most recent realized lead-time behavior (N=5). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N N=5 to capture the most recent higher-demand regime; this yields (1+L)\xd7recent mean handled by backend. For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices make the OR backend raise the base stock above the long-run level to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering if lead time shortens.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=341 (covers multiple periods but some past orders were delayed/lost historically). Recent observed lead times average ~1.5 periods; to reflect observed variability I set L to be calculated from concluded lead times. Demand has shown a recent uptick; I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods: Periods 20\u201324) so the OR backend targets current elevated demand. I mirror this recency for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat for recent higher demand) vs holding cost by relying on observed lead-time average rather than the promised default.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent demand has been elevated vs earlier baseline (Periods 21\u201325 demands = 124,90,122,75,135; 5-period avg \u2248109). On-hand=0, in-transit=341 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,1} \u2192 avg 1.5, so use calculated average lead time rather than promised to reflect variable arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from most recent 5 periods to capture the recent higher-demand regime (N=5). These settings help the OR engine size base stock to cover (1+L) periods under the recent demand level while sigma from recent volatility tightens safety stock; using observed-average lead time mitigates over/under-ordering risk given mixed late/lost shipments.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=365. Historical concluded lead times vary (mostly 1\u20132 periods) so use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has been elevated recently; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher regime (last 5 demands avg \u2248114). These parameters increase target base-stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand sustained high through Period 22\u201326: last 5-period avg demand = 113.6 (Periods 22\u201326: 90,122,75,135,146) confirming elevated regime continuation.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods); using the empirical average better aligns expected arrival timing than the promised value. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect realized shipping behavior. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current elevated demand regime (5-period window covers the most recent sustained high-demand evidence) so the backend targets a higher base-stock while keeping volatility estimated from the same window.

Promised lead time=2 and concluded history shows many arrivals with 1-2 period lead times; no new sustained lead-time shift since prior insights. To balance service level vs holding cost I use a recent_N demand forecast (capture elevated regime) with L=default so backend uses promised lead time. sigma_hat uses same recent_N window to reflect recent volatility.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=415 (large pipeline but historical concludes show some orders lost/delayed). Lead times in concluded arrivals vary (1\u20132), so use observed-average to let backend adapt to realized lead-time mix. Use a recent-5 demand window to capture the confirmed higher demand regime while avoiding stale low-demand samples. This raises base stock to protect service during the sustained uptick; capped ordering limits will restrain excessive ordering to control holding costs given $1 holding vs $4 profit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=368. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed: 2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,3,2 \u2192 avg \u22481.73). Demand has been in a sustained elevated regime; most recent 5-period avg demand (Periods 26\u201330) = 126.8, well above earlier baseline. I set L to "calculate" so backend uses the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures mixture of 1\u20133 period realizations). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the confirmed higher regime evident over multiple periods and avoid diluting with older low-demand samples. For sigma I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to protect service during the higher-demand regime while keeping volatility and lead-time evidence grounded in concluded arrivals; they also account for in-transit stock (368) when the OR backend computes final orders.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=407. Recent demand has been elevated since Period 22 with last 5-period averages ~114\u2013127; demand remains high (recent week demands: 143,107,126,112,147). Lead times observed historically show variability (1\u20133 periods) with an empirical average ~1.67. Because demand regime has clearly increased and is sustained over many periods, I use recent demand (N=5) to capture the current higher mean/volatility. For lead time I use the calculated average of observed conclude lead times to reflect the shown variability (backend will compute the exact average). These choices raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while the recent_N sigma captures current volatility; using calculated L helps the planner account for variable/occasionally delayed arrivals and avoid stockouts given the large in-transit position that may include delayed shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); recent arrivals (Periods 30\u201332) imply average lead time \u22482. Demand has sustained at an elevated regime since Period 13 with recent 5-period avg \u2248114.6 (Periods 28\u201332: 107,126,112,147,81). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average of all observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20133 observations). For demand level, I use recent_N N=5 to anchor mu_hat to the most recent elevated regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples) to avoid diluting the higher recent demand with older low-demand periods. For variability, I use recent_N N=5 so sigma_hat reflects recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost considerations via the backend's z-based safety stock and cap.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=380. Observed concluded lead times (from history) show variability but average >1 and <2; shipments both 1\u20133 periods observed and some earlier orders were lost/delayed. Demand has been in an elevated regime since Periods 22\u201326 (carry-over) and recent five demands (Periods 29\u201333 = 126,112,147,81,282) show a high recent mean driven by a big spike in Period 33. To respond I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the OR backend uses empirical average; I use a recent_N (N=5) estimate for mu_hat to capture the current elevated demand regime (keeps the (1+L) scaling) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility including the large spike. This balances service (higher target stock for elevated demand) against holding cost while relying on empirical lead-time evidence to mitigate lost/delayed shipment risk.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=563. Historical conclude messages show variable actual lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods) and some lost/delayed shipments; several recent arrivals indicate no single fixed short lead time. Demand has been in an elevated regime recently (higher 5-period averages and several large spikes). To balance service and holding cost: set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (captures realized variability); set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples to reflect the elevated recent demand regime and its volatility. This raises target base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while the OR engine's cap limits excessive ordering given in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=562. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed W={2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,1,3,2,2,1,3}, avg\u22481.73) so use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. Demand has shifted into a higher regime since Period 13 with multiple sustained high-demand stretches; to capture the most recent demand level I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stock for current elevated demand while reflecting recent volatility. In-transit inventory (562) will be reconciled by the backend against the chosen base stock given the inferred L and demand estimates.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=548. Historical conclude messages show variable actual lead times recently including several 3-period arrivals (Periods 30, 35, 36) so effective lead time appears >2. I choose to estimate lead time from recent observed lead times to capture that drift. Demand shows a sustained elevated regime vs early history; to capture current elevated demand and recent volatility I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 5 demand observations. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts given delayed/variable arrivals while accounting for higher observed demand and volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=548. Recent conclude messages show multiple 3-period arrivals (orders placed Period 32 arrived Period 35; Period 33 arrived Period 36) and a recent pattern of longer lead times plus several overdue large orders (e.g., Period 34 ordered=183 still unarrived by Period 37). Therefore I set lead time explicitly to 3 to reflect observed shipping delays. Demand has been elevated recently (Periods 33\u201337 demands = 282,116,87,131,219; 5-period avg \u2248167) so I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime. Volatility is also best estimated from the same recent window, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5. These choices increase inventory targets to improve service during sustained higher demand and to buffer against the longer observed lead time while controlling excessive holding by using a short recent window.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order on Period 32 arrived Period 35, order on Period 33 arrived Period 36; multiple 3-period lead_time observations in recent periods).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=805. Recent conclude messages (Periods 32,35,36,38) show multiple 3-period lead_time observations; supply behavior shifted to longer/more variable lead times. Demand has moved to a higher regime: last 5 observed demands (Periods 33\u201337 = 282,116,87,131,219) average ~167, well above historical mean. To protect service given long lead times and elevated demand, I set lead time based on recent observed lead times and center forecasts on the most recent 5 demands; volatility also uses the same recent window so the OR backend raises base-stock and cap appropriately while constraining orders to the cap.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=805 (large pipeline). Recent concluded history shows multiple 3-period lead_time observations (Periods 30\u201336), so use empirically averaged lead time rather than promised to capture recent shifts. Demand has moved to a higher, volatile regime over the last ~10\u201320 periods (sustained high weekly demand, recent samples: 87,131,219,225,89), so use an EWMA to overweight recent demand for mu_hat and a recent-window std for sigma_hat to reflect elevated volatility. Parameters chosen: L averaged from observed lead times to capture actual shipping behavior; mu_hat via EWMA (gamma=0.4) to react to recent high demand while smoothing noise; sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to size safety stock to current volatility. This balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost by increasing forecast responsiveness (reduce stockouts) while using recent volatility to avoid excessive holding given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=805. Recent concluded arrivals show multiple 3-period lead_time observations (e.g., P30\u2192P33, P31\u2192P34, P32\u2192P35/P35) \u2014 actual lead time appears to be 3 periods. Demand has been in an elevated regime recently; the last 5 observed demands (Periods 36\u201340: 87,219,225,89,77) show a high mean and volatility. To protect service given long lead time and elevated recent demand, set L explicitly to 3. Use a recent_N=5 demand estimate (captures the latest sustained high demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend scales base-stock and cap to recent demand and variability, balancing higher service level against holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time has been 3 periods (multiple orders: P30\u2192P33, P31\u2192P32, P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36) so use L=3 to cover delayed deliveries; substantial pipeline (805) will cover several periods but arrivals may be staggered. Demand has been elevated and variable in recent weeks; use recent_N (last 5) demand stats to capture current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock reflects recent mean and volatility while L=3 increases the (1+L) review horizon to limit underordering. This balances service (higher z* due to profit/holding) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=805 (large pipeline but many past orders showed varied/ delayed arrivals). Recent concluded lead-times (Periods 30\u201336 arrivals) show a mix of 3,2,1,3,3 \u2192 I use a short recent average to capture the recent shift toward longer lead times. Demand has been elevated in recent months; last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 38\u201342 = 225,89,77,61,204) give a higher short-run mean than the long-run sample. Therefore: set L by recent average of observed lead times (captures recent 3-period events); set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 5-sample windows to reflect the current higher and more volatile demand. These choices make the OR backend target higher base-stock to improve service under longer recent lead times while using recent volatility to avoid excessive overstock given holding cost.

Historical conclude messages show repeated 3-period lead_time observations (orders on P32->arrive P35, P33->P36) and multiple recent 3-periods \u2014 I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed reality rather than the promised 2. Demand has been elevated in mid-game with some volatility; given a large in-transit position and mixed recent weekly demands, I use an EWMA for mu_hat to adapt to recent shifts without overreacting (gamma=0.3) so the backend computes (1+L)*EWMA. I keep sigma_hat as default to let the backend use the full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices (L=3, moderate EWMA smoothing, default sigma) align inventory targets to the longer realized lead time, avoid under-ordering due to delayed arrivals, and leverage the existing large pipeline to limit excess holding cost.

Demand has been in an elevated regime; I use a recent_N=5 forecast (Periods 40\u201344 demands = 77,61,204,47,57 \u2192 mean\u224889.2). With (1+L)=4, mu_hat uses those 5 samples to capture current regime and cover the full review+lead horizon. sigma_hat uses the same recent_N=5 to reflect current volatility. This conservative choice (longer L and recent data) increases safety stock to preserve service given high service quantile (profit/holding \u2192 q=0.8) while acknowledging in-transit exposure and past lost shipments.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=805. Historical concluded lead times vary; recent concluded observations imply a mean lead time below the promised 2\u20133 range but with variability and occasional 3-periods. Demand has been elevated relative to early history but volatile in recent weeks; last 5 observed demands (Periods 42\u201346) = [204,47,57,54,23], 5-period average ~81. I choose: L by "calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures realized variability); mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to make the (1+L) demand forecast responsive to the latest regime; sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings balance service (accounting for observed lead-time variability) against holding cost by focusing forecast and uncertainty estimates on the most recent demand regime and observed lead times.
