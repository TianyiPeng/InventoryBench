Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observed lead-times vary (1\u20133 periods historically) so actual L is uncertain; only concluded arrivals used to infer this. Current on-hand=15 and in-transit=678 (large, though some past shipments were delayed/lost, recent pipeline has produced multiple concluded arrivals P43/P45), which comfortably covers expected demand under the elevated regime (~80 units/week). Required coverage for (L+1)=3 periods \u2248 3\xd780=240 units; pipeline+on-hand (693) >> 240. Holding cost is $1 vs profit $4 (critical fractile q=0.8) which would push safety stock higher, but excess pipeline makes new ordering unnecessary and would incur extra holding cost. OR recommended 0; I agree and place no order to avoid overstock risk while waiting for in-transit to conclude and be observed. Continue monitoring concluded arrivals and any evidence of lost shipments or further regime shifts before ordering.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order: on-hand 15 + in-transit 678 >> (L+1)\xd7demand (~240), so pipeline suffices for the elevated ~80/week demand despite variable lead times; avoid extra holding cost.",
