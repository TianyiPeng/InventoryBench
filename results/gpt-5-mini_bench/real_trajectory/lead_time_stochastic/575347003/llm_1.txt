  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-30 (week between Christmas and NYE): no strong seasonal uplift expected for basic men's socks; recent weekly demand has been moderate. Historical recent demand (Periods 43\u201346): 41,45,64,55 \u2192 avg \u224851. Use confirmed actual lead time = 2 periods (Period 6 evidence). Must cover L+1 = 3 periods of demand after decision. Forecast per-period demand ~55 (rounded conservatively from recent avg). Required coverage = 3 \xd7 55 = 165 units. Current on-hand = 0, in-transit = 383 units \u2014 pipeline already exceeds required coverage. Additional ordering would increase holding costs ($1/unit/period) unnecessarily and risk overstock. Therefore place no order this period.",
