Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical weekly samples (29,28,41,40,31) show stable demand; no evidence of lead-time change or regime shift. Use promised lead time (default=2) and default demand sizing so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~33.8/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=45 (order from P1) and no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps safety stock proportional to historical variability while accounting for the 2-period promised lead time and current pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=90 (two orders of 45). Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean=33.8, std from samples used by backend. Two consecutive periods show no arrivals yet, but this is insufficient (need \u22653) to conclude a lead-time change or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost without overreacting to a short gap in arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=123, recent concluded demand has risen (Periods 1-3 demands = 39, 51, 62) vs historical weekly mean ~33.8. Orders from P1-P3 (45,45,33) have not concluded by P4, indicating actual lead time is longer than promised; I set L explicit=3 to be conservative. To capture the recent upward demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 3 samples (39,51,62). This raises target base stock to cover the higher short-term demand while acknowledging delayed arrivals, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (45,45,33) have not arrived by Period 4 conclude \u2014 evidence suggests actual lead time \u22653 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $180.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded history: P2 order arrived with lead_time=2, but P1 and P3 remain missing \u2192 shipment variability/loss risk. On-hand=0, in-transit=148 (includes outstanding orders). Given missing arrivals, I conservatively set lead time longer than promised to protect against stockouts. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base demand on all available samples (mean\u224833.8 wk) and default sigma_hat to let backend scale variability with chosen L. This yields a (1+L)-period demand forecast that prioritizes service with modest holding cost tradeoff (profit $4 vs holding $1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=209. Historical baseline samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean=33.8/wk, but observed demand in gameplay Periods1-5 = [39,51,62,53,44], mean=49.8/wk (\u2248+47%), indicating a sustained upward demand regime over 5 periods. Arrivals: one concluded lead-time observation (order on P2 arrived P4 \u2192 lead_time=2); other earlier orders remain missing, so infer lead time via observed data rather than trusting lost shipments. To capture the confirmed demand increase I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the last 5 observed demands). For lead time I choose calculate so backend averages observed lead times (uses the single confirmed observation=2). This balances service level (higher mean and volatility from recent demand) against holding cost by explicitly using recent demand stats rather than older baseline. On-hand + pipeline reviewed: pipeline (209) likely contains prior orders including some possibly lost; using recent demand stats helps size future orders to cover (1+L) periods of higher demand while letting OR backend cap orders per its policy.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 1-5 (2019-02-11 to 2019-03-11) avg demand = 49.8/wk vs prior sample avg = 33.8/wk (+47%), sustained for 5 periods

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history shows observed lead times of 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6) \u2014 I use the average of observed lead times. Demand has shifted up: last 5 periods show a sustained higher regime (avg ~49.8/week vs prior ~33.8); therefore forecast using the most recent 5 samples to capture the new mean/volatility. On-hand=4 and in-transit=148 provide substantial pipeline cover, but using recent_N demand estimates ensures OR base-stock reflects the confirmed higher demand while containing holding cost exposure.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Demand has shifted up materially (recent 5-week mean ~56.4 vs prior ~33.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=167 units which should cover ~ (1+L) periods at the elevated demand. Lead-time observations from concluded arrivals: observed lead_times = {2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P5\u2192P6)}; average ~1.5. To capture the sustained higher demand and prioritize service while avoiding excess holding, I set L by observed average (calculate) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the new higher regime (recent 5 weeks mean \u224856.4, recent variability). This produces a base-stock tuned to current higher demand while letting the OR backend apply its z*-capping logic given profit/holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $76.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W = 2,1,1) so I use the average observed lead time to let the OR engine adapt. Demand has clearly increased since the initial historical samples: the most recent 5 concluded demands (Periods 4-8 = 53,44,57,66,95) average 63/wk, above the prior confirmed regime mean of 49.8/wk. To capture the new higher demand regime while keeping volatility tuned to recent dispersion, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples. This balances service level (higher target stock) against holding cost by focusing on recent elevated demand and short-term variability. On-hand=0 and in-transit=163 supports using a shorter inferred lead time (calculate) and recent-demand estimates rather than long-horizon defaults.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: recent 5-period avg = 63.0/wk (Periods 4-8, 2019-03-04 to 2019-04-01) vs prior confirmed avg 49.8/wk (+26.5%)

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,1,1} (avg \u22481.33); demand has shifted up in recent weeks (recent 5-period avg \u224863/wk). On-hand=0, in-transit=218 (covers multiple future periods). I choose L as recent_N N=3 to reflect the most recent observed lead-time mix (captures one 2 and two 1s). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to anchor mu_hat to the recent higher-demand regime (captures the 5-period elevated average) and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward meeting the higher current demand while accounting for the slightly reduced effective lead time versus the promised 2.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has risen materially (last 5 demands: 57,66,95,73,81 => avg=74.4/wk) and pipeline is large (on-hand=0, in-transit=159). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2,1} -> average ~1.4. To capture recent demand regime, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (last 5 samples) and match sigma_hat to recent volatility (recent_N, 5). For lead time I use calculate to let the backend average observed lead times. These choices bias orders toward current higher demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using recent mean and volatility; using recent stats reduces stockouts under the new regime while avoiding overstating long-term variability given limited history.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=245. History shows mixed lead-time observations (1\u20132 periods) but earlier multi-period delayed arrivals occurred; recent observed lead times (last 5 concluded arrivals) = [2,1,1,2,1], so I use recent average to capture current supplier behavior. Demand has risen sharply in recent weeks (latest 5 periods P7\u2013P11 mean demand = 92/wk), so I set demand estimates using the most recent 5 samples to capture the new high-demand regime. Using recent_N for sigma keeps variability aligned with this regime. These choices (L recent_5, mu_hat recent_5, sigma_hat recent_5) prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand period while the backend will compute base-stock and cap accordingly. I note in-transit stock is large (245) but some past shipments were delayed; the chosen recent lead-time estimate mitigates underordering if delays persist.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: recent 5-period avg (Periods 7-11) = 92.0/wk vs prior recent avg 63.0/wk (+46%); sustained for 5 periods

Historical concluded lead-times observed = {2,1,1,2,1} (avg ~1.4) though earlier missing arrivals suggested transient delays; recent demand has shifted sharply upward (most recent 5-period avg high). To capture current high-demand regime while letting backend infer effective lead time from observed concludes, set L via calculate (average observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to prioritize the latest elevated demand mean and volatility (covers the most recent sustained regime of high demand). This balances service (higher forecast) against holding cost by focusing on the confirmed recent demand spike rather than long-run low demand.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (many undelivered shipments may conclude later).

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=280. Historical concluded lead times (observed) = {2,1,1,2,1,2,2} => use calculate to let backend set L as average observed lead time. Demand shows a sustained high regime; most recent 5-week demand (Periods 10-14 = 81,145,130,88,95) avg=107.8/wk \u2014 use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current elevated regime. Volatility has increased with this regime; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so the backend estimates variability from the same window. These selections align pipeline sizing to recent demand and observed lead-time evidence and help balance service level vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-27. Demand has shown sustained step-ups; recent 5-week avg demand is high (Periods 11-15 demand = 145,130,88,95,131 \u2192 avg=117.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=365 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2] \u2192 avg\u22481.57. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the empirical average of observed lead times. For demand I select recent_N N=5 to capture the current elevated regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). For sigma I also select recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders upward to meet the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit inventory will temper new orders via the capped policy.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent weeks show sustained high demand (latest confirmed 5-period avg = 92/wk at Period 11 changepoint and subsequent very large demands of 131 and 153), on-hand=0, in-transit=390. Lead-time history shows a mix of 1\u20132 periods (several confirmed 2s and 1s); no new sustained LT change since prior concludes. To respond to the confirmed demand regime shift I use: L by calculation (let backend average observed lead times), mu_hat = recent_N with N=5 to target the most recent high-demand regime, and sigma_hat = recent_N with N=5 to capture recent demand volatility. This aims to raise the base-stock to meet the new higher demand while using recent volatility for safety stock; existing in-transit (390) will be reconciled by the OR engine against pipeline when ordering.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand is high and volatile: last 5 demands (Periods 13-17) = [88,95,131,153,105], 5-period mean=114.4/wk, substantially above earlier regimes. On-hand=5, in-transit=288 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; no new sustained lead-time shift since prior insights. To capture the recent upward demand regime I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock targets (which multiply by 1+L) respond to the higher recent mean and volatility. For L I request the backend compute the average of observed lead-times (calculate) to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period observed realizations. This balances service (protects against stockouts under higher demand) while the large in-transit reduces aggressive extra ordering and holding cost exposure.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Demand has experienced multiple upward regime shifts; most recent confirmed regime (Periods 7-11) lasted 5 periods with higher weekly demand. With large in-transit stock (378) arriving in unknown splits, we still must set parameters to match the recent higher-demand regime to avoid lost sales. I choose L='calculate' (use average observed lead time \u22481.56) to reflect actual delivery performance rather than the promised 2. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent sustained high-demand regime (protect service level). For sigma I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet current high demand while the backend cap will limit excessive single-period orders; using observed lead time reduces systematic under/over-stocking from lead-time mismatch.

Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20132 periods; some earlier delayed arrivals resolved), so use calculated average of observed lead times to let backend infer current effective L. Demand has experienced multiple upward regime shifts; recent 5-week demand (Periods 15\u201319 = 131,153,105,87,148) is much higher than the historic baseline, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher mean and volatility. This balances service (capture current high demand) against holding cost given a sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent demand has accelerated sharply: Periods 16-20 demand = [153,105,87,148,198] (5-period avg=138.2/wk). On-hand=0, in-transit=416 units. Observed concluded lead times (from arrive records) = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1] => avg=1.5. Given strong, sustained demand rise over the last 5 weeks, use a recent-5 demand estimate and match sigma to recent volatility. Use calculated average lead time to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period observations. This keeps pipeline coverage appropriate (orders + in-transit should cover (1+L) periods of high demand) while letting OR backend size safety stock via its z* and cap rules.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: recent 5-period avg (Periods 16-20) = 138.2/wk vs prior confirmed avg 92.0/wk (+50.2%), sustained for 5 periods

On-hand=0, in-transit=479 \u2014 pipeline is large and should cover upcoming demand despite current stockout. No new sustained lead-time evidence beyond previously recorded variation; use promised lead time. Set L using default (promised=2) so OR backend uses its lead-time assumption. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (5-period avg) when computing (1+L)*mean. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices bias orders upward to meet the confirmed higher demand while keeping volatility estimate aligned with recent experience.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=359 units which materially covers (1+L) periods of demand. Observed concluded lead times vary (mostly 1\u20132); I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To capture the recent sustained demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (the most recent stable changepoint window). This biases orders toward current high demand while keeping lead-time estimation data-driven; with in-transit stock high, this avoids aggressive extra ordering and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been high and volatile: last 5 weeks demand = [148,198,158,123,126] (avg 150.6/wk) vs prior confirmed regime avg 138.2/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Lead times observed in concluded history alternate 1\u20132 periods; recent arrivals (Periods 22\u201323) show lead_times = 2 and 1. To reflect recent faster/slower variability I use a recent average for lead time (captures most recent concluded lead times). For demand I use the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current elevated regime. Volatility will also be estimated from the recent 5 weeks. These choices bias the OR backend toward stocking for the elevated demand while respecting the large in-transit pipeline to avoid unnecessary over-ordering.

No new sustained lead-time evidence beyond previously observed 1\u20132 periods; use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. Use recent 5-period demand stats to reflect the current high-demand regime so the OR base-stock covers (1+L) review+lead demand while keeping holding costs in mind.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=496. Historical concludes show mostly 1\u20132 period actual lead times (mixed 1s and 2s); average of observed lead times \u22481.54 \u2192 use calculated average to let backend adapt to realized lead-time mix. Demand has undergone multiple sustained uplifts; recent 5-period demand (Periods 21\u201325) remains elevated (~120.6/wk) relative to original samples. To capture the current high-demand regime while limiting noise, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock is driven by the most recent demand regime. This balances higher service-level needs from elevated demand against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has moved to a higher regime: last 5-week avg demand = 110.2/wk (P22-26). Current inventory: on-hand=24, in-transit=366. Recent concluded arrival (Period 26) shows order placed P23 arrived in P26 (lead_time=3), so actual lead time is longer than promised. To capture the higher recent demand regime I set L explicitly to 3, and forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current elevated mean and variability. This helps the OR backend raise base stock to reduce stockouts given the confirmed higher demand and longer lead time, while sigma_hat recent_N preserves recent volatility for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (order placed P23 arrived P26; lead_time = 3)

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has risen and stabilized at a much higher regime: last 5 weeks (Periods 23-27) demands = [126,117,79,106,81], recent 5-week avg = 101.8/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=449 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrival visibility lags one period. Lead time has been confirmed as 3 periods (Period 23 order arrived Period 26). To reflect the confirmed longer lead time and the elevated recent demand regime, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand under the current high-demand regime and captures recent volatility; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given higher demand and longer LT) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand (Periods 24-28) avg = 90/wk; carry-over confirms actual lead time = 3 (observed P23\u2192P26). With promised review+lead window = 1+L = 4 weeks, I set L=3 to match observed lead time. Forecast demand for the 4-week review+lead = 4\xd790 = 360 units (mu_hat explicit). Recent sample std \u2248 20.71; scaled by sqrt(4) -> sigma_hat \u2248 41.42 (explicit). On-hand=0, in-transit=449 > expected 4-week demand (360) so pipeline covers forecast; parameters aim to avoid additional ordering while matching confirmed longer lead time and elevated recent demand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has fallen from earlier peaks; last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 25-29) = [79,106,81,67,59], recent 5-period avg = 78.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=449 \u2014 multiple past orders arrived with 3-period lag (P23->P26); lead time confirmed = 3. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed 3-period lead time and avoid underordering. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current (lower) demand regime; this makes the OR base-stock smaller (reduces holding cost risk) while the confirmed L ensures pipeline coverage for 4 periods (review+lead), balancing service and holding costs.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=31, in-transit=366. Lead time has been confirmed as 3 periods (Period 27 evidence). Recent demand (Periods 26-30 = 106,81,67,59,52) shows a new lower-but-stable regime; 5-period average = 73. To ensure pipeline covers review+lead (L+1=4) under the confirmed LT and recent regime, I set L explicitly to 3 and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This prioritizes meeting elevated recent demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=366 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals unseen until next conclude). Historical concluded lead-time evidence confirms actual L=3 (order P23 arrived P26). Recent demand (Periods 27-31 = 81,67,59,52,42) shows a lower recent mean; to adapt to the latest regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current week-level demand. L set explicit=3 to match observed lead time and ensure the OR backend orders for the correct (1+L) review+lead window, preventing understock from delayed arrivals while balancing holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (evidence P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30).

Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (Period 23 order arrived P26). Recent demand has moderated vs prior peaks: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 29-33) = [59,52,42,51,74], recent 5-avg = 55.6/wk. To cover review+lead demand and react to the most recent regime, set L explicitly to 3 (evidence: confirmed arrival P23\u2192P26). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of the most recent 5 weeks (captures current lower-demand regime). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (covering 4 weeks given L=3) against holding cost while accounting for confirmed longer lead time and recent demand pattern.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (P23->P26 arrival). Recent demand (Periods 31-35) = [42,51,74,43,65], recent 5-week mean = 55/wk. To cover review+lead (1+L=4) periods and reflect confirmed LT=3, set L explicit=3. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to let backend compute (1+L)*mean = 4*55=220 units forecasted demand across review+lead. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices address missing/lost shipments by explicitly using the observed longer lead time and recent-demand regime to avoid under-ordering while balancing holding cost via the OR engine's service-level cap.

Recent demand (Periods 32-36 = 51,74,43,65,33) shows current regime ~53.2/wk. To cover review+lead (1+L=4) weeks and reflect recent regime, set L explicit=3.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=366 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability with confirmed 3-period arrivals (evidence P23->P26); several earlier missing arrivals imply occasional longer lead times. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks P33-P37 = 74,43,65,33,55) mean=54 units/week. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and past lost/delayed shipments. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent higher-demand regime (gives (1+L)-period demand forecast anchored on recent mean). I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices ensure the backend targets service for the current elevated demand while accounting for longer arrival delay and avoiding excessive holding by using a short recent sample.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30 evidence); promised=2 but shipments have shown L=3 repeatedly. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delivery behavior so the OR engine orders for the correct pipeline length. Demand recent 5 periods (Periods 34-38) average ~48.6/wk; I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture the latest regime and scale by (1+L) in backend. Volatility also set to recent_N N=5 to reflect current demand variability. With large in-transit stock (366), this keeps orders conservative while matching true lead time to avoid stockouts from delayed arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (Period 23 order arrived Period 26). Recent observed demand (Periods 35-39 = 65,33,55,47,35) average = 47/wk; demand appears moderate and not showing a new sustained shift. To reflect confirmed LT=3 I set L explicit=3 so the OR backend plans over the correct (longer) pipeline. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 observed demands (captures current lower-demand regime). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices ensure pipeline coverage for the longer confirmed lead time while keeping safety stock aligned to recent realized demand and variance, avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, In-transit=366. Historical conclude messages (notably P26: P23\u2192P26) confirm actual lead time = 3 periods and several earlier multi-period delays; many recent periods show moderate demand (Periods 36-40 demands = 33,55,47,35,39). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed longer lead time so the OR engine orders enough to cover the longer pipeline delay. For demand I use a recent_N=5 estimate (latest 5 weekly demands) to capture the current lower/moderate regime rather than older high-demand spikes; mu_hat uses recent_N so (1+L) multiplies the recent mean. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices ensure pipeline cover for the 3-period lead time while avoiding overstating demand from earlier spikes, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand (last 5 weeks Periods 37-41) = [55,47,35,39,46], avg=44.4/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=366 units (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (observed arrivals with 3-period delays). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time and avoid underordering due to longer arrivals. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current post-summer demand regime (most recent 5 weeks avg=44.4); sigma_hat uses the same recent 5-week window to reflect current volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend sizes base stock for the 4-period review+lead horizon using the latest regime while the explicit L prevents systemic stockouts from underestimated lead time given past 3-period arrivals. Current in-transit inventory (366) should cover multiple periods, so the recent-N forecast prevents excess new ordering.

To cover current demand regime (recent elevated weekly demand including a large Week 42 =101) I set L explicitly to 3 and use recent 5-week demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-variance, late-year regime. This keeps base-stock sized to (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, balancing service (avoid stockouts given long LT and recent spike) vs. holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical conclude messages indicate actual lead time has been confirmed at 3 periods previously; pipeline (366) is large but arrival visibility is delayed by the conclude lag. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks Periods 39-43 = 35,39,46,101,41) average = 52.4/wk; I treat this short-run level as the current regime to size the (1+L)-period forecast. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (responds to the Nov spike but prevents diluting with older low-demand weeks). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a base stock covering the review+lead horizon (1+L=4 periods) using current observed demand and volatility while recognizing confirmed lead-time =3 and the conclude-delay on arrivals.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 3 (Period 27 evidence) and multiple earlier delayed shipments\u2014so use explicit L=3 to reflect realized supplier behavior. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime (most recent 5 weeks) and avoid diluting estimates with older high-variance periods. This keeps base_stock responsive to current demand while the OR backend caps orders; parameters aim to ensure pipeline + on-hand cover (L+1) periods of recent demand to reduce stockouts given confirmed LT=3 while limiting excess holding costs.
