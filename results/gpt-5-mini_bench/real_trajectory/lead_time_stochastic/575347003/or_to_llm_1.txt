OR recommended 33 units (base-stock capped) but that assumes using its full base-stock calculus and treats pipeline differently; given we already have 90 in transit likely covering most of the horizon, we only need to top up the gap. Risk note: if in-transit orders actually are lost, we would need much larger orders, but we lack the 3+ period evidence required to treat shipments as lost per the rules. Final strategy: place a conservative top-up order of 12 units to cover the estimated 3-period demand shortfall while avoiding excess holding cost.

This is a material regime shift (\u2248+63%) and should drive replenishment. Coverage target: because arrivals occur after decision and demand occurs this period, plan to cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand. At recent demand =55, required pipeline = 3\xd755 =165 units. Current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) = 0 + 69 =69, so incremental order = 165 \u2212 69 = 96 units.

Inventory math: on-hand=0, in-transit=326. Demand outlook: recent weeks (Periods 42\u201346) demands = [101,41,45,64,55], mean \u2248 61/week; earlier sustained high regime (~120) is already captured in past carry-over notes but recent 5-week average is ~61, so use a conservative short-term forecast of 61. Coverage requirement: promised L=2 \u2192 need to cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand \u2192 3\xd761 = 183 units. Pipeline 326 > 183, so current pipeline sufficiently covers the next review+lead period. Cost tradeoff: profit $4 vs holding $1 favors avoiding excess holding when pipeline already exceeds required base_stock. OR recommended 0; I agree and place no order to avoid holding cost and because in-transit provides buffer. No new carry-over insight to record.",
