Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows a clear upward regime: 2019-01-07:0, 01-14:0, 01-21:56, 01-28:216, 02-04:319. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=2. I use L=default to rely on promised lead time (no concluded arrivals to infer otherwise). Demand has shifted sharply starting 2019-01-21; to capture the new regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (last three non-zero samples 56,216,319) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on the recent elevated demand. This balances service (avoid severe stockouts during the newer high-demand regime) against holding cost by limiting the window to the recent regime rather than all historical zeros.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent samples [56,216,319], recent mean=197 (vs prior 0), sustained for 3 periods

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=415 (order from P1) and P1 conclude shows arrived=0 which is expected given promised L=2; no confirmed lead-time change. Historical demand shows a regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent samples [56,216,319], mean ~197). To capture the higher recent demand I use recent_N for demand estimates (N=3) while keeping L at default (promised) because no concluded arrivals contradict it. This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and variance so the OR backend increases base stock to balance service level versus holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand has clearly shifted up since 2019-01-21 (historical samples + Period1=276 and Period2=207). On-hand=0, in-transit=771 but prior orders from P1/P2 have not concluded yet\u2014no new confirmed lead-time evidence, so keep promised lead time. I use recent_N=5 for demand forecasts to capture the new higher regime (samples from 2019-01-21 onward include 56,216,319,276,207). Using recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new regime while keeping L as promised since arrivals remain unconcluded.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=929 but prior periods' orders have not arrived (Period1-3 concluded arrived=0) suggesting shipments delayed/lost beyond promised L=2. Use explicit L=3 to be conservative vs promised 2 so pipeline coverage accounts for potential extended lead time. Demand in the last 3 selling periods = [276,207,163]; use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat to capture the new higher regime (recent mean \u2248215) and recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service while capping orders via OR cap to limit overstocks given large in-transit.

Daily Profit: $3496.00, Daily Holding Cost: $172.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $3324.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows an observed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). On-hand=172, in-transit=693 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand has shifted up since 2019-01-21. I set L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead-time average (2). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime reflected in the last three demand observations (periods 2-4) so the OR engine targets a base-stock over the 1+L=3-period review+lead window and uses recent volatility to size safety stock. This balances service (avoid stockouts given sustained higher demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand and in-transit inventory.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has settled below the early spike: last 5 demands = [276,207,163,184,158] (downward from the Jan regime). On-hand=14, in-transit=693 (large pipeline) but note missing arrivals: order placed Period 3 (158) did not conclude by Period 5 \u2192 evidence of lost/delayed shipment. Observed lead time = 2 (Period 4 conclude: order on P2 arrived after 2 periods). To be conservative I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures confirmed 2-period evidence). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks), and use recent_N,N=5 for sigma to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with current demand while accounting for confirmed lead-time behavior and avoiding overreacting to older high spikes; they also rely on existing large in-transit volume to limit new orders while the shipment situation resolves.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21; recent realized weekly demands (last 6 concluded periods) = [276,207,163,184,158,129], recent mean \u2248186. Use observed lead-time evidence (Period 4 conclude: order on P2 arrived with lead_time=2) so set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the post-changepoint regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7recent_mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent_std). On-hand=0 with in-transit=716 \u2014 pipeline currently provides substantial cover, but using recent demand avoids underordering if elevated demand persists while keeping holding costs moderate.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=716. History includes a confirmed arrival showing actual lead time=2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Recent demand has been elevated and sustained (periods show 276,207,163,184,158,129,169) so I will trust the backend's default demand aggregation and promised lead time. No new sustained lead-time or regime changes beyond previously recorded shift; use default L, mu_hat, sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base stock and cap from full-sample stats and observed lead-time history.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has been elevated since 2019-01-21 and sustained across multiple periods (see carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=728. Concluded arrivals show orders from Period 2\u21924 and Period 6\u21928 (lead_time=2), while several earlier orders (P1, P3) never concluded \u2192 lost shipments exist. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (avg=2). For demand I use recent_N to capture the post-change regime; regime length since the 2019-01-21 shift is 6 recent concluded demand periods, so I set N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent regime. This focuses the base-stock on the new higher-demand regime while acknowledging in-transit stock; higher mu_hat raises target inventory to cover review+lead periods, and recent sigma helps size safety stock to balance $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period2 order arrived Period4; Period6 order arrived Period8).

Recent demand has declined from the post-Jan spike; I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the current regime (last 5 periods) so forecast and volatility reflect recent lower weekly demand and avoid overstock given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19. Methods chosen: L by calculate (uses observed lead-times=2); mu_hat recent_N N=5 to target (1+L)-period demand using recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=693 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple periods, so avoid inflating targets.

Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods to capture the recent downward demand regime and variance; this keeps base stock and cap responsive to the current lower demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate order quantity, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent demand after the Jan regime shows lower weekly sales (last 6 demands: 169,193,104,81,90,93 -> mean ~121.7) and in-transit=693 with on-hand=0 (large pipeline). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods in earlier concludes. To avoid overstocking given high pipeline, use recent demand (last 6) to set forecast and volatility while keeping promised lead time. This reduces ordering aggressiveness versus using the earlier higher regime mean.

Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 2 periods; demand earlier jumped (2019-01-21) but recent weeks show lower demand (last 5 demands = [104,81,90,93,66], recent mean ~86.8). To be conservative given visible pipeline, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend confirms L=2. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean reduces target base stock and limits holding cost while preserving service).

Recent demand has moderated from the early spike; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10-14) = [81,90,93,66,59], recent mean \u2248 77.8. I choose L=default to use promised (and confirmed) 2-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean uses recent behavior and avoids overstock from earlier spike). This also keeps target base-stock smaller to reduce holding cost given large in-transit inventory. Sigma estimated from the same recent 5 samples to reflect current variability.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent demand has fallen from earlier peaks; last 5 realized weekly demands = [90,93,66,59,48] (mean \u2248 71). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=693 units (covers many weeks), and lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods historically. To avoid excess holding cost given high pipeline, set lead time to promised (default) and base demand forecast using the most recent regime (recent_N=5) so OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Use recent_N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This reduces new ordering while pipeline clears, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has trended down from spring peaks; last 5 period demands = [93,66,59,48,34], recent mean = 60. On-hand=0, in-transit=693 \u2014 pipeline far exceeds (1+L)-period demand under recent regime (3\xd760=180), so no aggressive replenishment is needed. Use L=default (promised 2) since lead time has been previously confirmed and backend expects promised LT. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking; use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent lower volatility. This combination reduces target base-stock to match the new lower demand while the large in-transit position prevents stockouts, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=693 (large pipeline) so avoid over-ordering. Lead time has been observed consistently as 2 periods (use historical average). I set L by calculate to reflect observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend produces a base stock sized to recent demand and the large in-transit inventory, balancing service level and holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=693 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 2 (consistent: P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8). I set L by calculation (average of observed lead times =2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent downshift; mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples so the OR engine will size forecast to current lower demand and avoid excess holding given holding cost=1 vs profit=19. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility reduction.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=693 (large pipeline). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2. Recent demand has fallen from earlier spike; most recent 7 periods show low steady demand (Periods 13-19: 66,59,48,34,31,22,20). To avoid excess holding given large pipeline and low recent demand, use promised lead time and base demand estimates from the recent low-demand regime (last 7 samples). Choices: L=default (promised 2); mu_hat=recent_N with N=7 to reflect current low-demand average over the (1+L) review+lead horizon; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to capture recent volatility. This reduces overstating demand from the earlier spike while the backend caps orders using its cap formula.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent weekly demand has declined from the earlier 2019-01-21 regime (confirmed previously) and the last 8 concluded periods show low demand [66,59,48,34,31,22,20,5] indicating a new low-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=693 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 2 periods (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P8\u2192P10); use calculated lead time to reflect observations. To avoid overstock given large pipeline and low recent demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures current low-demand regime and reduced volatility), letting the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps target base-stock modest and caps orders via the backend cap, balancing service vs holding cost given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized well below the earlier spike: P10\u2013P21 demands average ~46.5/week (12 samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=693 (ample pipeline coverage). Promised lead time=2 and past concluded arrivals confirm lead_time=2; use promised lead time. To avoid overstock given low recent demand and nonzero holding cost, forecast using recent demand (captures the downward regime). Chosen L=default (promised=2). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=12 to reflect the last 12 weeks (P10\u2013P21) where demand settled low. sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=12 to capture recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine to target a base stock based on current low demand while recognizing the 2-period lead time and existing large in-transit quantity.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 10 (2019-04-15): avg demand P10\u2013P21 = 46.5 units/week (12 samples), down from prior regime mean ~197 (earlier spike); sustained low-demand regime for 12 periods.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=693 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 (previously observed and stable). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand parameters with N=13 (P10\u2013P22) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the post-spike average and volatility; L kept as default (promised=2) because observed lead time has been stable and matches promise. This balances service (use recent low mean to avoid overstock given large in-transit) against holding cost.

Promised lead time 2 has been previously confirmed; keep promised lead time. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the current low-demand regime length (14 samples from P10\u2013P23). This reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding given large in-transit inventory while preserving service for expected low demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has fallen sharply: last 5 weeks (P20\u2013P24) = [5,9,9,6,12], avg=8.2/wk, down from prior low-regime avg ~46.5 (P10\u2013P21). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=693 units, which already covers many review+lead periods, so no additional inventory likely needed. Set L to promised lead time (default=2). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new sustained low-demand regime (5 weeks). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent low volatility. These parameters will reduce target base-stock to the current low demand level and avoid excess holding costs given the large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 20: avg demand P20\u2013P24 = 8.2 units/week (5 samples), down from prior regime mean ~46.5 (P10\u2013P21); sustained for 5 periods

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=693 (large pipeline that will cover upcoming demand). Historical actual lead time has been stable at 2 periods; no new sustained lead-time signal. Recent demand has been low since Period 20 with a single spike in Period 25; to be conservative and responsive to the most recent regime, I use a recent-N demand estimate based on the last 6 weeks (Periods 20\u201325) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps the OR engine focused on the current low-demand regime while the large in-transit position prevents stockouts. L uses the promised/default lead time.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been low since Period 10 with a brief very-low regime (P20\u2013P24) but last two weeks (P25\u2013P26) show a sharp uptick (58,71). On-hand=0, in-transit=693 units (ample pipeline). Lead-time history shows consistent 2-period arrivals; keep promised lead time to avoid over-correcting. To adapt to the most recent demand signals while avoiding overstock, I base demand forecasts on the last 5 weeks (captures the recent uptick while smoothing against prior low regime). Using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat gives the OR engine a short-window forecast to raise target inventory moderately; keeping L=default ensures the backend uses the contractual lead time and the cap limits order size so pipeline absorbs demand without excessive holdings.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has re-accelerated in Periods 25\u201327 (58, 71, 101) after a prolonged low regime; this looks like an emerging higher-demand regime but only 3 periods long so treat as recent trend. On-hand=0, in-transit=693 \u2014 with promised L=2 (review+lead = 3 periods) the pipeline (693) currently covers multiple weeks of demand, so avoid ordering based on long-run averages. Set L to default (promised 2). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the latest uptick while limiting exposure to holding cost. These parameters steer the OR backend to target inventory for the short, recent demand regime and prevent over-ordering against older high-variance spikes.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=693. Recent demand has risen sharply over the last 4 weeks (P25\u2013P28 = 58,71,101,74) indicating a new higher-demand regime versus the prior low regime. Promised lead time is 2 and historical concluded arrivals support L=2, so use default lead time. To react quickly to the recent uptick I select recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility (captures the new regime while remaining responsive). This balances service (capture recent surge) against holding cost by limiting lookback to the recent regime rather than the long low-demand history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 25 (2019-07-29): avg demand P25\u2013P28 = 76.0 units/week, up from prior regime mean 8.2 (P20\u2013P24); sustained for 4 periods

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=693. Recent demand has risen since Period 25 (periods 25\u201329: [58,71,101,74,100], recent mean \u224880.8/week) \u2014 sustained 5-week higher regime. Promised lead time=2 (confirmed historically). Use L=default to keep promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (backend will scale by (1+L)). In-transit (693) is ample vs. (1+L)*recent mean, so orders will be calibrated by OR engine to balance profit ($19) vs holding ($1).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has rebounded since Period 25 (P25\u2013P30 = [58,71,101,74,100,157], mean=93.5) after earlier low regimes. On-hand=0, in-transit=693 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 periods; historical concluded arrivals confirm 2-period lead time. To align the OR base-stock with the new higher-demand regime, I use a recent_N forecast over the 6 most recent weeks (P25\u2013P30) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. L kept as default (promised) so backend uses promised lead time; recent_N (N=6) captures the sustained rebound and avoids diluting with older low-demand samples. Large in-transit inventory will limit additional ordering via the backend cap, helping balance service vs. holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=693 \u2014 substantial pipeline that will cover near-term demand if it arrives. Historical concluded lead times = 2 (stable), and recent demand regime shifted up starting Period 25 (2019-07-29) with samples P25\u2013P31 = [58,71,101,74,100,157,161] (7 weeks). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. I keep L=default (promised 2) because concluded evidence confirms 2 and backend expects promised lead time; using recent_N demand estimates lets the OR engine size base stock to meet the current uptick while the pipeline (693) reduces immediate ordering need and helps avoid over-ordering if arrivals materialize.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=693 units (pipeline >> expected (1+L)*mean), so avoid over-ordering but maintain service. Use promised lead time (default L=2). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=8 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent_mean). Use recent_N for sigma with N=8 to reflect current volatility. This balances higher service-level target for the observed uptick while letting the OR engine cap order size to limit excess inventory given the large pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has rebounded sharply since Period 29 (weeks 29\u201333: 100,157,161,146,342). On-hand=0 but in-transit=693 units (ample pipeline). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 2 periods; I use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. To capture the recent higher-demand regime (starting Period 29) I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses the most recent 5 concluded samples) so the OR base-stock targets higher service while the large in-transit reduces urgent ordering need. This balances profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by adapting forecast to the confirmed uptick but relying on existing pipeline to avoid excess immediate orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 29: avg demand P29\u2013P33 = 181.2 units/week (5 samples), up from prior regime mean ~76 (P25\u2013P28) (+138%).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent weeks (P29\u2013P34) show a sustained high-demand regime (samples: 100,157,161,146,342,214) after prior volatility; on-hand=0, in-transit=809 units which likely already covers several weeks of demand but arrivals are observed with 1-period reporting lag. Lead time has been confirmed historically as 2; I'll use promised/default L. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 6-sample regime (P29\u2013P34). This biases the backend forecast toward current elevated demand while the capped ordering policy will prevent extreme single-period orders given pipeline inventory, balancing service level (profit $19) against holding cost ($1).

Demand has clearly shifted back to a high regime since Period 29; recent demands (Periods 29\u201335) = [100,157,161,146,342,214,190], recent mean \u2248201/week. With L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 weeks; (1+L)*recent mean \u2248 603 units. Pipeline (809) already exceeds this, so no immediate replenishment is needed\u2014parameters use recent_N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility for safety. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock targeting current service level while avoiding extra orders given the large in-transit position.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has rebounded to a high regime: last 7 weekly demands (P30\u2013P36) = [157,161,146,342,214,190,184], recent mean \u2248199 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=809 units which is substantial vs. (1+L)\xd7mean. Lead-time history (concluded) confirms 2-period actual lead time; use promised/default L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect the current high-demand regime and recent volatility, ensuring base-stock targets and caps are driven by current observed demand rather than older low-demand periods. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large recent weekly demand) against holding costs (pipeline already large).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in the high regime that began Period 29 (weeks 29\u201337 show consistently elevated demand; recent samples P29\u2013P37 = 9 weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=809 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-time evidence supports 2-period actual lead time but promised = 2; use default promised lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 9 concluded demand samples (regime length = 9 => N=9). This keeps orders aligned with the elevated demand while the large in-transit quantity will cap actual orders via the OR cap, avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has rebounded strongly since Period 29; last 10 weeks (P29\u2013P38) average \u2248200 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=809 \u2014 ample pipeline (809 > (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248600). Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods; use promised/default L. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime while avoiding older low-demand noise. This keeps the OR base-stock aligned with the observed surge but avoids placing additional orders given large in-transit stock, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been high and stable since the regime beginning around Period 29; last 10 weeks (P30\u2013P39) average \u2248192 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=809 (ample pipeline). Lead time historically confirmed as 2 periods. I choose L=default (use promised 2). Set mu_hat to recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples). Set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 so variability reflects the same recent window. This keeps the base-stock tuned to the current high-demand regime while the large in-transit stock limits additional ordering and holding cost exposure.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=809. Historical concluded lead times confirm 2 periods; I keep L as promised to match observed. Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 29 (periods 29\u201340 demands: [100,157,161,146,342,214,190,184,213,192,124,129], mean=179.3). With L=2 the review+lead window is 3 weeks, so I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and avoid understating target base-stock. Use recent_N (N=12) for sigma_hat to reflect observed volatility in the same window. This leverages the in-transit stock (809 \u2248 4.5\xd73-week demand) while letting the OR backend compute exact base_stock and cap to balance service vs holding costs.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=2 (orders P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8); recent demand since P29 is a sustained high-demand regime. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times (confirms 2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=13 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 29\u201341, 13 samples) so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet elevated demand while capping order size to limit excess holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been high since Period 33 (Sep 23) with the last 11 weekly demands: [342,214,190,184,213,192,124,129,109,227,30] \u2014 elevated vs earlier low regimes and likely influenced by autumn/holiday season; on-hand=0, in-transit=809 (sufficient pipeline). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 2 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history (confirms L=2). I use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current high-demand regime ((1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std will be computed by backend). This keeps service high through season while pipeline (809) already provides coverage; using recent data avoids diluting forecast with older low-demand periods.

Recent demand regime since Period 29 shows elevated weekly demand (many weeks ~150\u2013230) including Black Friday / holiday season spikes; use recent_N to capture this higher recent mean and volatility. Chosen N=16 to cover Periods 29\u201344 (regime length 16) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained high-demand regime and let the OR backend size base stock to meet holiday demand while capping orders via its cap rule.

LLM Rationale:

Promised lead time = 2 and prior concluded messages confirmed 2-period arrivals. Recent demand last 3 concluded weeks = [30,54,59] (mean ~47.7) \u2014 a small sustained low-week cluster after a one-off spike (227) two weeks earlier. To avoid excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19, set lead time = default (use promised 2), and forecast demand using the most recent 3-week regime (captures current post-spike lower demand). Use recent_N=3 for sigma to reflect short-window volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to minimal new order (pipeline already large) while matching short-term demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=809 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 in prior evidence. Recent demand has dropped sharply starting Period 43. Set L by calculate to use observed lead-time history. Forecast demand using most recent low-demand regime (Periods 43\u201346) so backend bases base-stock on current low mean: use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current volatility and keep inventory modest given large in-transit stock and low holding cost vs. profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 43 (2019-12-02): avg demand P43\u2013P46 = 50.75 units/week (4 samples), down from prior regime mean ~150; sustained for 4 periods.
