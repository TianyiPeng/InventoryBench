Inventory & demand: On-hand=0, in-transit shown=250 (unreliable). Historical dataset mean \u03bc\u0304=120.2 (from given samples) -> OR base_stock = (1+L)*\u03bc\u0304 = 3*120.2 \u2248 361 units. OR assumed the 250 in-transit and capped/shrank its order to 22 units; that underestimates needs if the 250 is lost. Recent realized demand spike (Period 4 demand=147, prior weeks lower) could be a one-off; not enough sustained evidence to declare a regime shift. Decision rule: because the 250 in-transit is likely lost, order to restore a conservative portion of the base-stock while avoiding heavy holding costs (profit=holding=$1 so overstock is costly). I target roughly half the gap to OR base_stock: order \u2248 150 units (rounded).

At Period 44 we have on-hand=0 and in-transit=411. The promised L=2 but actual L is noisy; however we must act on visible pipeline (in-transit=411) rather than assume complete loss.\n\nDemand outlook: Recent demand history exhibits transient spikes (Periods ~20\u201330) followed by a low-demand regime (Periods 32\u201343 mostly single- or low-double-digit weekly demand) with an isolated large drawdown at Period 42 (379 demand consumed inventory). Outside those spikes the baseline is low. Using OR's logic (profit=holding \u2192 critical fractile 0.5), safety stock is minimal.\n\nInventory math & risk: With in-transit=411 units, even if some shipments are delayed, pipeline substantially exceeds expected (L+1)-period demand under the current low-demand regime. Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so extra inventory directly reduces objective; ordering now risks unnecessary holding cost if pipeline arrives.\n\nDecision: Follow the OR recommendation and order 0 units.
