With supplier promised lead time = 2, an order placed now will not arrive before demand in the current period; we must cover current period plus the next two periods (L+1 = 3 periods). Given recent peak evidence (216 on 2019-02-04) and the upcoming Valentine event, I forecast elevated demand ~150 units/period conservative (weighted toward recent high but avoiding extreme overstock). On-hand + in-transit = 0, so order should cover ~3 periods of expected demand = 3 * 150 = 450 units. This balances service for the holiday spike while limiting holding cost exposure.
