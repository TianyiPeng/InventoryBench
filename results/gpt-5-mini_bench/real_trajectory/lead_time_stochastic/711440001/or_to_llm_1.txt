OR recommended 82 (uses promised L and cap) but current reality: on-hand = 0 and the Period1 order of 70 has not concluded by Period3 conclude (arrived=0) and remains only as 'in-transit' in system. That order was due to arrive by Period3 if promised lead time held; absence of a conclude by Period3 indicates the shipment is overdue and likely lost or subject to longer-than-promised lead time. Because holding cost = profit, the critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z*\u22480 so base-stock equals expected demand \u03bc\u0302 (~286).
