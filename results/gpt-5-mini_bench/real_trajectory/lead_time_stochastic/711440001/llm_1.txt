  "rationale": "World knowledge & product: SKU is a women's sweater\u2014demand can be seasonal and responsive to near-term events (Valentine's Day 2/14 is upcoming). Historical demand: 2019-01-07:11, 01-14:11, 01-21:10, 01-28:11, 02-04:74 (single large spike on 02-04). This looks like a recent surge but not yet sustained. Lead time: supplier promised 2 periods; no concluded arrivals in history, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision logic: because arrivals occur after ordering and demand for current period still occurs post-decision, we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of expected demand in pipeline. Given the single recent spike and the proximity to Valentine\u2019s Day, I use a cautious elevated per-period demand estimate of ~30 units (between the long-run ~11 and the recent 74 spike) to balance stockouts vs holding cost. Order = 3 periods \xd7 30 = 90 units (no on-hand or in-transit to offset).",
