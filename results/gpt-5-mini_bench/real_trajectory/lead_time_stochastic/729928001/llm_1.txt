======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas week) \u2014 demand has peaked early Dec and is dropping into late Dec. Product is a seasonal skirt (winter holiday sales possible earlier in December). Demand analysis: recent realized weekly demand P43\u2013P46 = [112,118,70,42], 4-week avg = 85 units/week; near-term demand likely in the 40\u2013120 range but trending down post-Christmas. Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised 2 periods; historical conclude messages show mixed actual lead times (1\u20133) and some lost shipments earlier, but recent large orders (P41, P42) did arrive (P43, P45), so pipeline is at least partially reliable. Inventory assessment: on-hand = 189, in-transit = 1176 (large). Even if a portion of in-transit is lost, on-hand alone covers ~2\u20134 weeks at current demand rates; combined with likely arrivals this is heavy overstock. Cost tradeoff: Profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is substantial and large inventory will erode objective. Decision logic: avoid adding to pipeline; do not increase in-transit exposure. Order 0 this period to reduce holding cost risk and wait for clearer evidence of persistent higher demand or confirmed lost shipments before replenishing.",
