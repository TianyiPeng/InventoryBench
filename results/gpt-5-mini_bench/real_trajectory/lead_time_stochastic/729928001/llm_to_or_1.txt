Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand samples (weeks in Jan 2019) show stable weekly demand around 80 (71,79,82,90,80). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so no incoming coverage; no concluded arrivals to infer a lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample. This balances service level vs holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio ($4 vs $1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly mean demand \u224880.4 (samples through 2019-02-04). Period 1 conclude shows demand=97 (single high week) but this is not yet a sustained regime change (need 3+ periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=92 (ordered in P1). The observed zero arrival in Period 1 conclude is expected given promised lead time; no concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock = (1+L)*mean and variance from full sample set, which balances service level with holding cost while we await more arrival/conclude data.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Promised lead time is 2 and no concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1 & P2 still in-transit=191), so actual lead time is unconfirmed; missing arrivals could be delayed but not yet proven lost. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~80.4. I use default lead time (promised L=2) because concluded evidence is insufficient to change it. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set\u2014this is conservative given the short, possibly transient demand spike in recent concluded periods (97,171) that isn\u2019t yet a sustained regime shift. This balances service level vs holding cost while we wait for confirmed arrivals and more demand data.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) center ~80 units/week. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=338 (many units outstanding). Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 all reported arrived=0 when they should have arrived under promised L=2 \u2014 three consecutive missed arrivals implies the actual lead time is longer (or shipments lost). To be conservative and ensure pipeline covers demand during extended delay, I set L explicitly to 3. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, letting the backend compute base stock and cap given the longer lead time. This raises target inventory to protect service level versus holding cost while we await confirmation of arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as >=3 periods (orders placed on Periods 1\u20133 all show arrived=0 when they should have arrived under promised L=2)

=== Period 4 Summary ===
729928001: ordered=104, arrived=99 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=99, demand=73, sold=73, ending on-hand inventory=26
Daily Profit: $292.00, Daily Holding Cost: $26.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $266.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent confirmed arrival: Period 4 conclude shows 99 units arrived (ordered P2) => observed lead time = 2 for that shipment. On-hand=26, in-transit=343 (pipeline ample vs demand). Some earlier orders showed delays but we have confirmation of L=2 from P2 arrival, so do not escalate lead time yet. Use calculated L (average of observed lead times) and default demand statistics (use full sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) to let OR backend compute base-stock while capping ordering. This balances service level (profit > holding cost) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=343. Concluded history shows one observed lead_time=2 (P2\u2192arrived P4) but orders from P1 and P3 remain unconcluded past promised L=2 => evidence of delayed/lost shipments. I set L explicit=3 to conservatively cover observed delays so pipeline covers more future demand. Demand samples mean=80.4 (weeks in Jan\u2013Feb); using mu_hat default lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples with L=3 to scale for review+lead period. sigma_hat default lets backend scale sample std by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level (protect against delayed arrivals) vs holding cost by increasing coverage modestly rather than inflating explicit forecasts.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=419. Historical weekly demand mean from samples = 80.4. Concluded arrivals give a single observed lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4); earlier orders showed delayed/no arrival but not yet a sustained confirmed longer lead time. Because only one confirmed lead-time observation exists, use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (will be 2). Use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap given its demand stats. This balances service (covering the review+lead window) while avoiding overreacting to possibly transient delayed shipments; high in-transit suggests existing coverage once arrivals finalize, so avoid explicit inflation of mu_hat which would increase holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=419. History shows intermittent arrivals: one concluded arrival with lead_time=2 (Period 4), other orders overdue or missing\u2014signals occasional delays but insufficient sustained evidence to upweight lead time beyond observed. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (uses concluded messages only). Recent demand appears lower and stable over the last several periods (Period 3-7 demands = 105,73,72,67,71); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on this most recent regime (N=5 is within the allowed range). These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the current lower demand regime while using observed lead-time data to guard against over-ordering amid delayed arrivals; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=343. Recent concluded arrivals (P4: order P2 arrived, lead_time=2; P8: order P6 arrived, lead_time=2) support actual lead time = 2. Earlier missing arrivals occurred (Periods 1\u20133) but recent two confirmations are consistent with promised L=2. Demand history shows recent volatility with spikes (P2=171, P8=139) vs typical ~70s; to adapt, use a recent-window demand estimate (N=5) to capture the current regime while avoiding overreacting to single spikes. Set L via calculate (average observed lead times =2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base-stock on the latest demand regime and recent variability, balancing service level (to cover recent high-demand weeks) against holding cost.

Historical weekly demand samples center ~80 units/week. I select L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (matches promised 2), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This respects current pipeline (large in-transit) while relying on full-sample demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=343 \u2014 large pipeline but past arrivals show some variability with occasional missing arrivals. Observed concluded lead times (orders on P2->arrived P4, P6->arrived P8) average 2 periods so use calculated L to reflect observed data. Demand recently has mixed low-70s baseline with a recent spike (139 in P8); to capture near-term regime while smoothing older samples use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat (captures P6\u2013P10). Keep sigma_hat at default to reflect aggregate historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices aim to size the base stock for a 3-period coverage (review+lead) using recent demand while letting OR backend compute safety stock given profit/holding ratio, avoiding overreaction to a single spike despite large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=343. Recent concluded history shows intermittent arrivals (P4 and P8 arrivals consistent with promised L=2) but multiple earlier periods had missing arrivals \u2014 possible lost/delayed shipments; however this pattern is not sustained across 3+ consecutive conclues to justify changing lead-time or demand regime. Use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. Choose L=default to keep OR engine using promised lead time; mu_hat=default to anchor forecast to the full-sample mean (captures baseline weekly demand \xd7 (1+L)); sigma_hat=default to provide backend with full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (using historical mean) against holding cost conservatively given uncertain shipments and large in-transit quantity.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=343. Historical concluded lead-times observed = 2 (orders P2->P4, P6->P8); several other orders never concluded (possible lost shipments) but concluded evidence supports lead_time=2 on average. Demand recent 5 periods (P8\u2013P12) = [139,64,72,80,71] showing one spike but otherwise ~70s. To be conservative and reflect observed lead time, I ask backend to calculate L from observed lead-time history (captures confirmed 2). For demand I use recent_N=5 to weight the recent regime (includes the spike), and sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (using recent demand to avoid understock after the P8 spike) against holding cost given high holding cost relative to profit by relying on recent short-window stats rather than long-run mean. The large in-transit (343) will be reconciled by OR engine when computing pipeline inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). Recent demand has stabilized near ~64\u201380 units/week (last 5 periods mean \u224870.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=343 (large pipeline). Historical concludes indicate delayed arrivals; user-provided carry-over suggests lead time has extended. To protect service given extended lead time while avoiding excess holding (profit $4 vs hold $1), I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (most relevant for the (1+L) review+lead window). This keeps the base-stock responsive to recent demand while the large in-transit volume will limit actual order sizes via the OR cap.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=343. Historical demand samples (Jan 2019) show weekly mean \u224880; recent periods show many stockouts so recent demand data is censored. Several past orders were delayed or lost; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods to protect against overdue/in-transit shipments. With L=3 I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample set (avoids bias from censored recent zeros). This balances higher safety stock to capture uncertain arrivals while relying on proven historical demand to limit excess holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=385. Historical conclude messages show two confirmed arrivals with lead_time=2 (Period2\u21924, Period6\u21928) while several earlier orders never concluded (possible lost shipments). Given repeated confirmed lead_time=2, use the calculated average lead time to reflect observed behavior. Demand history matches pre-spring weekly sales; no strong recent demand regime shift detected, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base_stock while protecting against lost/unseen shipments via the pipeline-aware order cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order on Period 2 arrived Period 4; order on Period 6 arrived Period 8).

On-hand=0, in-transit=385 \u2014 ample pipeline stock vs typical weekly demand (~mean ~80 from historical samples). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (reflects confirmed L=2).

Demand history (many stockouts after Period 4) does not show a sustained recent regime shift; use overall sample statistics for forecast.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 periods (Period 2\u21924, Period 6\u21928, Period 15\u219217). On-hand=0, in-transit=343 units \u2014 ample pipeline stock versus typical demand. Historical sample mean = 80.4 units/week (samples from Jan\u2013Feb 2019). Using promised/default lead time (L=2) and default demand estimates gives mu_hat = (1+L)*mean \u2248 3*80.4 = 241.2 units (covers 3 periods) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std \u2248 sqrt(3)*6.803 = 11.79.

I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (will be 2). Demand has shown a recent active regime (recent nonzero weekly demand: P15\u2013P19 = 45,85,73,81,99); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture this current demand level over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. sigma_hat left as 'default' to use overall historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices (calculate L; recent demand for mu_hat) align ordering with confirmed lead time, reflect the recent uptick in demand, and keep uncertainty conservative so the OR backend balances service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Recent demand when available shows higher levels (Periods 16\u201320 demands: 85,73,81,99,162) indicating a sustained upward regime; use the last 5 concluded demand periods to capture this shift. Set L by calculating observed lead time average to reflect confirmed LT=2. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine targets higher coverage for the elevated demand regime while sigma from recent data captures increased variability. This balances service (avoid large lost-sales given current in-transit and higher observed demand) versus holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=363. Concluded lead-time observations (P4, P8, P17, P23) all show actual lead time = 2 periods, so use calculated/observed L. Recent demand has shifted up since late May/June (multiple weeks with demand 81,99,162,111,91,84,129) \u2014 sustained for 7 periods \u2014 so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the new regime and keep orders aligned with elevated demand while limiting holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 2 (multiple orders: P2->P4, P6->P8, P15->P17, P21->P23). On-hand=0, in-transit=367 (pipeline present). Use calculated lead time to reflect observed data and let backend compute base_stock with L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (keeps forecast anchored to historical demand while accounting for L=2). This balances service level (use observed LT) vs holding cost given moderate in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=347. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times: P4:2, P8:2, P17:2, P23:2, P26:3 (mostly 2 with one 3). Pipeline is large so avoid inflating demand forecast; use recent average lead time to capture the small recent uptick. Set L via recent_N over last 5 observed lead times to reflect current mix. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use historical sample mean/variance scaled by 1+L) because available long-run demand samples are limited and large pipeline covers short-term demand volatility. This balances service (dont under-order given sizable in-transit) and holding cost by relying on backend's capped ordering.

Recent conclude history shows mostly 2-period actual lead times with one 3-period outlier; average observed lead time \u22482.17 so I let backend compute the average (calculate) to capture that recent mix. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples, allowing it to scale safety stock with the inferred L while avoiding overfitting to short-term spikes. This balances service level (capture observed L>2 occasional delays) vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times mostly 2 periods (observations: 2,2,2,2,3,2 \u2192 avg ~2.17) and demand samples from Feb\u2013Feb/Mar show weekly demands in 49\u2013162 range with recent weeks ~50\u2013162 (no clear permanent regime shift). On-hand=0 + in-transit=343 implies substantial pipeline already; some earlier orders experienced a single 3-period delay but majority confirm L\u22482. I choose L="calculate" so backend uses the average observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to "default" so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all historical samples. This balances service (use observed lead time) vs holding cost given large in-transit position and no sustained demand regime change.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=343. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = {2,2,2,2,3,2} (mostly 2, one 3) and earlier missed arrivals but recent pattern confirms ~2 periods. To let the OR backend infer a robust lead time from observed arrivals I select L='calculate' (average observed lead time). Demand forecast and volatility will use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the engine uses full historical demand for base_stock and caps; this is conservative given large pipeline and mixed lead-time signals. These choices let the backend balance service level (using observed lead time) vs holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=343. Historical concludes show mostly 2-period arrivals with one 3-period case (observed lead times: 2,2,2,2,3,2 \u2192 avg\u22482.17). Pipeline (343 units) is large relative to typical weekly demand (~70\u2013160 historically) and likely covers multiple (L+1) periods, but some past shipments were delayed/lost so use observed lead-time evidence. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time (captures the slight >2 signal). For demand and volatility I use 'default' so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this leverages full sample history and the inferred L to produce a conservative base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost. This approach acknowledges mixed lead-time evidence while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise and accounts for the large in-transit pipeline when computing orders.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=343 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times with one 3-period anomaly; recent observed lead times average slightly >2. Demand in recent months (Jun\u2013Sep) is materially higher than early-year levels, so I use recent demand to set mu/sigma. Choices: L set to calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the slight >2 mean); mu_hat recent_N with N=12 to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the last 12 periods (captures the recent high-demand regime); sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture recent volatility. This raises base stock and safety stock to meet a high service target implied by profit/(profit+holding)=0.8, while acknowledging substantial in-transit inventory to avoid overordering.

Recent concluded history shows multiple confirmed lead_time=2 arrivals (P4, P8, P17, P23, P27) and one observed 3-period arrival (P26); average of observed lead times is \u22482.17 so I use calculated average to capture slight drift while letting backend know realized lead time centers near 2. On-hand=0 with in-transit=343 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists (likely covering several weeks of demand), so use default demand/stat volatility estimates (backend will apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of historical samples). This balances service (capture modest lead-time inflation via calculated L) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Historical concluded lead times: observed values = 2,2,2,2,3,2 \u2192 avg \u22482.17, indicating actual lead time slightly > promised 2 with occasional 3. Demand history (weekly samples provided) shows no recent sustained mean shift requiring adjustment. To account for slight lead-time inflation I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time (calculate). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the backend incorporate the inferred L into safety stock and cap calculations. This balances service (using empirically longer L) versus holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

Historical concluded lead-times show consistent 2-period behavior in multiple confirmed observations (Periods 4, 8, 17, 26, 27) though one 3-period outlier occurred; using a calculated L lets backend average observed lead times. Use default demand/volatility formulas so mu_hat and sigma_hat follow (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples; this balances service level against holding cost given the substantial in-transit stock and moderate profit/holding ratio (profit=$4, holding=$1).

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand 0, in-transit 343. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has been observed as 2 periods in recent confirmed events; no sustained evidence of a new lead-time regime or demand regime shift. Pipeline (343) already covers multiple future periods under promised L=2, so use default estimators to let the OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample statistics and promised lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise. Methods chosen: L=default to use promised lead time (backend knows promised L=2 and recent confirmations); mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean(all samples); sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=343 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead times observed mostly 2 with one 3 (observed lead times: 2,2,2,2,3,2) \u2192 use calculate to let backend average observed LT. Recent demand in last 5 concluded weeks (Periods 33\u201337: 120,90,81,54,105) averages ~90; using recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses forecasts on the current higher-demand regime while (1+L) scaling is applied by backend. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit stock and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=343. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,2,2,3,2} (avg \u22482.17) with more recent confirmations of 2-period lead time. Several past overdue shipments occurred but recent evidence supports an average near the promised 2. To balance service level vs holding cost I set L to be the calculated average of observed lead times so the OR engine internal lead-time estimate reflects realized variability. Demand and variability will use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to leverage all historical samples given no sustained, recent demand regime shift. This approach preserves responsiveness to realized lead-time drift while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise in demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=343. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods with one 3-period instance (observed LT samples: 2,2,2,2,3,2 \u2192 avg\u22482.17). In-transit volume (343) comfortably covers several (L+1) weeks of typical demand, so no urgent correction to forecast. Use calculated average lead time to let backend reconcile slight >2 mean; use default mu_hat/sigma_hat (all samples) so OR engine computes demand across review+lead using full history and balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand elevated and volatile (recent 5 demands: 54, 105, 127, 80, 71). On-hand=0, in-transit=343 \u2014 substantial pipeline that likely covers upcoming demand but some past shipments showed occasional 3-period delays while later evidence (Periods 4,16) supports lead time=2. I select L=default (promised 2) because concluded history mostly confirms 2; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest demand regime (captures current higher variance), which helps the OR backend size base-stock for current demand while avoiding excessive inventory given holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=343. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 periods (confirmed P4 and P17/P8 patterns); no new sustained changepoint in demand. Using promised/confirmed lead time preserves OR engine assumptions. Set L=default to use promised lead time (2). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 and large pipeline inventory (343) already en route.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=343. Historical conclude messages show earlier confirmed lead-time episodes but no new sustained shift in lead time or demand regime since last recorded insights. I therefore use the promised lead time (default) so OR backend uses its known L; for demand and volatility I keep defaults (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overreacting to the single large recent spike (Period 42). This balances service level against holding cost given large pipeline stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=343 \u2014 a large pipeline exists but no recent conclude arrivals (Period 43 conclude showed arrived=0). Historical concluded lead-time samples show mostly 2 with one 3 (observed lead times = [2,2,2,3,2]); average ~2.2. Demand history (weekly samples provided) will be used by default aggregation. To balance service level versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1, use inferred average lead time (calculate) so backend scales review+lead coverage appropriately while using default demand/volatility estimates from full sample set. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime shift since Period 16, so keep defaults for demand stats.

Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period actual lead times (one 3-period outlier), so use averaged observed lead time to reflect realized behavior. Use default demand/volatility scaling so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set; given profit $4 vs holding $1 (high critical ratio ~0.8) this will push a higher base-stock while respecting observed lead-time reality and letting OR cap limit excess orders.

Past concluded data established actual lead time = 2 (Period16 evidence). Given large pipeline and confirmed lead time=promised, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies full-sample mean/volatility across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (use pipeline) while avoiding overstating a short-term spike as permanent.
