Although earlier carry-over flagged delayed/lost shipments for P1\u2013P3, we have not yet observed additional sustained lost-shipment evidence beyond that record, so do not escalate. Demand outlook: recent realized weekly demand (Periods 4\u20138) = [143,129,138,200,194], recent average \u2248 161 units/week; (L+1)=3 implies expected demand over review+lead \u2248 483 units. Inventory balance: on-hand=0 + in-transit=590 > expected 483, so pipeline currently sufficient to cover the next (L+1) periods even allowing for some variability. Cost tradeoff: profit $4, holding $1 favors some safety stock, but ordering now would increase holding cost and OR already caps orders to avoid overstock.
