OR's capped recommendation (87) is far below the expected 3-period demand and would almost certainly cause stockouts given zero on-hand and zero in-transit. Risks & judgment: recent 2 observations show a downward trend (50 \u2192 36) so true demand may be somewhat below the 5-sample mean, but this is only two points and not yet a sustained regime shift. Profit per unit ($4) is high relative to holding cost ($1), implying a high critical fractile (q=0.8) and a willingness to hold safety stock to avoid lost sales. Decision: place an order to cover most of the expected (L+1)-period demand while pulling back modestly for the recent downward signal. Action quantity = 160 units (vs OR 87) \u2014 this provides ~2.74 weeks of expected demand (160/58.4 \u22482.74), materially reduces stockout risk versus OR, but avoids the full base-stock (~200) because of the recent downward datapoints and to limit holding cost exposure.",

Promised L=2 implies that P1 order should arrive during Period3 (visible in P4 conclude), so the lack of arrival in P1 is expected and is NOT evidence of a lost shipment or shorter lead time. Inventory math & demand outlook: historical mean demand \u224858.4 units/week; (L+1)=3 periods \u2192 expected demand over next 3 periods \u2248175.2 units. Current pipeline (in-transit=160) + on-hand=0 is slightly below that (~15 units short) but any order placed now would arrive in Period4 (after two-period lead) and therefore cannot affect demand in the immediate 2 upcoming periods. OR recommended 30 units based on base-stock cap, but that recommendation ignores the current in-transit quantity and uses promised lead time only. Decision logic: Do not place an order this period because: (1) ordering now cannot remedy near-term coverage (arrives too late), (2) the existing in-transit nearly covers the L+1 demand so small shortfall is tolerable given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) and uncertainty about lost shipments, and (3) placing an order now only increases future holding cost while giving no benefit to current-period service. Therefore set order=0 for SKU 464908002.
