Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead periods. No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Historical weekly samples (75,51,57,123,84) give mean\u224878; with promised L=2 using default formulas ((1+L)*mean) provides a balanced base-stock estimate while default volatility captures observed variability. This keeps service level aligned with profit/holding tradeoff given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent historical weekly demand mean = 78 (samples: 75,51,57,123,84). On-hand=0, in-transit=125 (Period1 order still not concluded). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; use promised lead time to avoid overfitting. Choose L=default (promised 2). Use mu_hat=default to set base-stock = (1+L)*mean = 3\xd778 (backend will compute). Use sigma_hat=default to reflect historical variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This conservative choice balances service level (covers 3 periods of demand) against holding cost given limited evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime changes.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=245 (125+120) \u2014 shipments not concluded yet but present in pipeline; no concluded arrivals to change promised lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5): [75,51,57,123,84]. Promised lead time remains the conservative choice. Use default L to let backend assume promised lead time=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=332. Three past orders (P1=125,P2=120,P3=87) have not shown arrivals in conclude messages; only P1 was expected to have concluded by P3 but arrived=0 (possible delay/loss). Evidence is not yet sufficient to confirm a persistent lead-time increase (need >=3 concluded late arrivals). Use promised lead time to avoid over-correcting. Set L=default (promised=2). Demand history (weekly samples mean=78) will be used by backend: use default mu_hat => (1+L)*mean across all samples, and default sigma_hat => sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This balances service level given substantial in-transit stock (332 units) while avoiding extra orders until lead-time/loss patterns are confirmed.

Daily Profit: $1121.00, Daily Holding Cost: $61.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1060.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent conclude shows the order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (ordered P2 -> arrived P4), so observed lead time = 2, matching the promised lead time. On-hand=61, in-transit=212; pipeline plus on-hand appears sufficient for near-term demand but we must cover (1+L) periods. Historical weekly demand samples (75,51,57,123,84) have mean=78. I set L using observed data (calculate) to let backend confirm average observed lead time. For demand I use the default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) capturing 3-week coverage; sigma_hat default to reflect sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by targeting the backend's base-stock recommended service quantile while keeping holding scaling conservative given current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order on Period 2 arrived on Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=248. Recent concluded history shows an operational lead time of 2 (confirmed in Period 5 carry-over). Demand historical samples mean=78/week -> using standard default forecast over review+lead. I choose L by calculation (average observed lead times =2) to reflect observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock against holding cost (profit=19, hold=1 favors moderate service level). This also avoids overreacting to one short stockout event while pipeline (248) is sufficient to cover upcoming demand under L=2.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=9, in-transit=267. Historical demand samples (weekly Jan 2019): mean=78. Observed lead times: Period2->P4 = 2, Period5->P6 = 1 (mixed recent evidence). I choose L.method=recent_N with N=2 to let backend average the two most recent observed lead times (captures recent variability without overreacting). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set\u2014this balances service level (use recent averaged L) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory and modest on-hand stock. This approach is conservative given occasional 1-period arrival and prior confirmation of 2-period events.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical concluded lead times show variability but previous confirmed insight records a 2-period lead; recent arrivals include a 1-period instance so not yet a sustained lead-time shift. Recent demand has fallen over the last 3 concluded periods (demands: Periods 5-7 = 70, 27, 18), suggesting a lower near-term demand regime. To be responsive to this recent drop while not overreacting to potentially noisy single arrivals, I set L to default (promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the most recent demand regime (captures the decline and reduces forecasted replenishment). This balances service (by accounting for current pipeline) against holding costs given high in-transit inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=50, in-transit=212 (ample pipeline). Historical weekly demand samples show moderate variability (2019-01 weekly samples: 75,51,57,123,84) and recent realized demands in history. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8) \u2192 average \u22481.5. I select L by calculating the average observed lead time to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period behavior. With ample pipeline and no clear sustained demand regime shift, use default forecasting methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the capped policy limit order size. This balances service (high pipeline) against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): recent concluded history shows mixed lead-times (observed 2,1,2,1) but earlier insight confirmed lead time=2 and promised lead time is 2. On-hand=35, in-transit=232 (large pipeline). Demand samples baseline mean=78 (given history). To avoid overreacting to mixed short-term LT signals and because pipeline is already substantial, use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set\u2014this provides a conservative refill level that leverages the large in-transit inventory and the known historical demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Current on-hand 36 + in-transit 220 = pipeline 256, which already covers many periods at current demand. Recent concluded demand shows a sustained drop since Period 6 (demands: P6-10 = 27,18,25,15,19 avg\u224820). Observed lead times from concluces = [2,1,2,1,1] (avg 1.4). I set L to "calculate" so backend uses the average observed lead time. For demand forecasting I detect a recent low-demand regime starting Period 6 and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures P6-10). This reduces target base-stock to reflect the lower demand and avoids excess holding given low holding cost but large pipeline. These params balance service vs holding by aligning forecast to the new low-demand regime while letting OR cap limit ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 6: prior mean (samples from 2019-01) \u224878 units/week vs recent mean P6-10 \u224820 units/week (\u221274%), sustained for 5 periods

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). Recent demand has fallen sharply vs Jan baseline: samples P6-10 demands = [27,18,25,15,19], mean \u224820.8 vs historical mean \u224878. On-hand=14, in-transit=220 (large pipeline vs current low demand). Promised lead time=2 (confirmed earlier). To avoid overstock given sustained low-demand regime, set L to default (use promised 2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean based on the 5-period low-demand regime (N=5 chosen because changepoint spans P6-10, 5 samples). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock to match the new low-demand regime and curb replenishment despite large in-transit volume.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=220. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 6: recent weeks (P6\u2013P12) average demand \u224820 units/week vs prior \u224878. Lead-time observations have been mixed but earlier carry-over confirmed typical lead time=2; no new sustained lead-time change detected. To avoid overstocking given low recent demand and sizable in-transit, keep L as default (promised=2) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (Periods 6\u201312) to capture the sustained lower mean/variance and reduce ordering relative to older high-demand data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period actual lead times but promised=2; keep L=default to let backend assume promised lead time while we monitor arrivals. Demand regime dropped starting Period 6 (carry-over). Recent demand (Periods 6\u201313 = 27,18,25,15,19,22,38,20) has mean \u224822.0; use recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-change lower regime while including the recent spike. Use same recent_N (N=8) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters will lower the base-stock to match the sustained lower demand while allowing for the recent variability; existing in-transit (220) should cover upcoming demand given lead time=2, so we avoid aggressive ordering now.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 6 (recent weekly demands \u2248 15\u201338, mean \u224822) versus the earlier Jan samples (~78). Observed concluded lead times in history = [2,1,2,1,1] (most recent 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=220 (large pipeline). To reflect the confirmed low-demand regime, I set demand forecasts using recent samples (last 9 weeks, Periods 6\u201314). For lead time I average the last 5 observed lead times to capture recent variability (1\u20132 periods). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the current low-demand regime and reduces over-ordering despite a large in-transit pipeline; using recent_N for L helps the OR engine account for observed shorter/variable arrivals. Sigma is estimated over the same recent window to match realized variability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized vs Jan samples: recent 10-period mean \u224821.8 units/week (Periods 6\u201315). There is substantial pipeline (220 units) and on-hand=0; expected pipeline already nearly covers a 3-period coverage target so aggressive ordering is unnecessary. Promised lead time remains 2 and recent concluded lead-time evidence (Periods 2\u21924) supports using the promised lead time (keep default). I therefore set L=default to let backend assume promised 2. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 6\u201315) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent_mean \u2248 3\xd721.8 to reflect the sustained lower regime and avoid overshooting orders given large in-transit. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce risk of excess inventory while preserving service given the large in-transit stock.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=220. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time=2 earlier and a sustained demand drop starting Period 6 (recent mean \u224820/week vs prior \u224878). In-transit (220) covers multiple weeks but may arrive with 2-period promised lead time. I keep L as default (promised=2). For demand I use recent_N reflecting the low-demand regime starting Period 6; regime length from P6\u2013P16 = 11, so N=11. Use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 11 samples, which targets service for the current low-demand regime while avoiding overstock given holding cost of $1 vs profit $19.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been low since Period 6: mean demand P6-17 = 21.2 units/week (sustained ~12 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=220 (large pipeline already covers multiple weeks). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods); average should be inferred from history. Choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times average (captures realized 1\u20132 period behavior). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=12 (covers P6\u2013P17 low-demand regime mean \u224821.2; mu_hat=(1+L)*mean over these 12 samples) to reflect the sustained lower demand rather than older high-season samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 to capture current volatility. These parameters reduce orders compared with historical-high forecasts, preventing excess stock given the large in-transit volume while maintaining service for current demand variability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 6 (sustained ~20/week vs ~78 earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=220 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1] \u2192 avg \u22481.4; choose calculate to let backend use observed avg. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (Period6\u2013Period18) to capture the sustained low-demand regime and avoid overstocking the large in-transit; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This reduces forecasted (1+L)-period demand while still honoring high service-level implied by profit/holding, and prevents ordering on top of the 220 units in transit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has stayed low since Period 6 (sustained regime ~14 weeks: Periods 6\u201319). On-hand=0, in-transit=220 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 which matches earlier confirmed observation; I keep L as default to let backend use promised lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the post-shift low-demand regime (captures the \u221274% drop since Jan). This avoids over-ordering given the large in-transit and low recent demand, while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent variation.

Promised lead time remains 2 and prior evidence confirmed lead time=2; no new sustained lead-time change. To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime, set L to default (promised=2) and compute demand parameters from the recent regime (Periods 6\u201320, 15 samples) so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility. This reduces over-ordering given the large in-transit and lower realized demand, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=220. Historical arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20132 periods) but overall average \u22481.4; demand dropped sharply starting Period 6 and stayed low for many periods with occasional spikes in P20\u2013P21. Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. For demand, use a recent_N estimate anchored on the post-Period-6 low-demand regime (use the last 16 periods since the regime is sustained) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower demand and its volatility rather than the earlier Jan samples. This balances service (capture recent lower mean) while keeping some safety via sigma_hat from the same recent window; using recent data also guards against overstock from older high-demand samples.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=220. Historical observed lead times (from concluded arrivals) = {2,1,2,1,1} \u2192 recent average \u22481.4; I use recent_N to capture that shift away from the promised 2. Demand shows a long low regime from Period6\u201319 (mean \u224819) but a sharp uptick in the last 3 weeks (Periods20\u201322 = 59,98,87). To react quickly to the recent spike while still grounding on recent history, I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (short window focusing on latest volatility and level). These parameters let the OR backend raise target base-stock to cover the apparent new higher demand while sigma_hat based on recent variability tightens safety stock sizing. Using recent lead-time average avoids over-ordering if actual L<2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period20: avg increased from \u224819.1 (Periods6\u201319) to \u224881.3 (Periods20\u201322), +326%

Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2); last 5 observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,1] \u2192 avg\u22481.4, so I use recent_N (N=5) for L to capture this variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) covering the new high-demand regime (Periods20\u201323) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of these 4 high weeks. Volatility likely driven by the same recent regime, so sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4). These choices prioritize matching supply to the new higher demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit volume.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=284. Recent demand regime increased starting Period 20 (P20\u2013P24 demands: 59,98,87,65,30) \u2014 higher than earlier low-demand regime. Promised lead time is 2; recent concluded lead-time observations are mixed but earlier carry-over confirmed L=2, so use default promised lead time to avoid overfitting to ambiguous arrival delays. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new higher-demand regime (capture P20\u2013P24). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices direct the OR engine to target a base stock appropriate to the new regime while using the promised lead time the backend expects; they also rely on the large in-transit pipeline to avoid unnecessary additional ordering.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows a clear demand regime jump starting Period 20 (Periods 20\u201325 demand high: 59,98,87,65,30,58). On-hand=0, in-transit=284 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and previously confirmed as 2 (Period 5 evidence); no new sustained lead-time change observed. To prioritize meeting the new higher-demand regime while acknowledging the large pipeline, I keep L=default (promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to focus the forecast on the post-change regime (Periods20\u201325) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to cover the higher demand while sigma reflects recent volatility. This balances service level vs holding cost given the existing large in-transit stock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has rebounded since Period 20 (sustained higher mean); latest 7-week window (Periods20\u201326) shows mean \u224873.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=226 (large pipeline). Lead-time observations are variable (observed W={2,1,2,1,1,3}); using calculated average lead time to let the backend weight all evidence. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the post-Period20 regime (7 periods of elevated demand). This balances service (capture higher recent mean) while the large in-transit inventory limits over-ordering risk.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W = 2,1,2,1,1,3) so I choose to let backend compute an empirical average lead time rather than trust promised fixed value. Demand has a confirmed regime shift starting Period 20 (sustained higher demand); use recent regime data to forecast demand and volatility. Therefore: L set to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=8 (Periods20\u201327 demand samples) so the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the new higher-demand regime. This balances service (capture recent spike) while the large in-transit (304) will limit actual orders via the backend cap.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand has jumped (Periods 26-28: 117,154,102) compared with earlier low regime; on-hand=0, in-transit=363 which provides coverage while new lead-time estimate is set. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1,3]; the most recent 5 observed lead times indicate increased variability, so I use recent_N for L to adapt to the shorter/longer arrivals. Demand forecast uses the last 5 weeks (Periods 24-28 demands = 30,58,117,154,102) to capture the current high-demand regime (N=5). Volatility uses the same recent window to reflect current variability. These choices let the OR backend raise target base stock for the new higher-demand regime while accounting for variable lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=416. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 20 (Periods 20\u201329 mean \u224883.7 units/week, sustained >3 periods) so I base demand forecasts on the recent window. Lead times have varied historically (observed 1,2,3); use averaged observed lead time to let backend infer typical arrival lag. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 demand samples (Periods 20\u201329) to capture the current high-demand regime and volatility; this keeps the base-stock responsive to the sustained uplift while avoiding overweighting old low-demand data. Using recent lead-time estimate reduces risk of underordering given prior delayed/lost arrivals and large in-transit position.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 20 (many weeks of 60\u2013154 units); recent weeks (Periods 20\u201330) show sustained elevated demand. On-hand=29, in-transit=279 \u2192 pipeline=308 units, which covers multiple weeks of elevated demand but some in-transit arrivals have shown variable lead times (including 3-period arrivals). I set L via "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20133 period observations). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the post-Period-20 high-demand regime (use most recent 11 samples P20\u2013P30). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=11 to reflect volatility in the recent high-demand regime. These choices bias ordering toward servicing the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the OR backend compute service-level safety stock using observed lead-time behavior and recent demand statistics.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 20; last 5 weekly demands (P27\u2013P31) = [154,102,67,108,121], mean \u2248110.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=328 (sizable pipeline). Lead times have recently shown longer tails (observed lead times: 3,3,2 in most recent concluded arrivals), so I use a short recent average to capture the shift while not overreacting. Set L via recent_N (N=3) to let backend average recent observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat to cover increased demand) vs holding cost (using recent samples limits overstock), while relying on pipeline (328 units) to cover immediate demand.

Last three observed lead times = {3,2,1} \u2192 avg 2.0, so use recent_N for L to capture recent variability. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 20 (sustained high demand through Periods 20\u201332). I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (Periods 20\u201332 inclusive) to reflect the current high-demand regime and its volatility.

On-hand=0, in-transit=372 which provides cover versus longer lead times. For L I use "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (observed LT vary 1\u20133 periods).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 20 (avg \u224881/week) with volatile weekly spikes (e.g., Periods 30\u201335: 108,121,115,105,210,67). Current inventory: on-hand=26, in-transit=332 \u2014 ample pipeline but some past shipments showed variable lead times (1\u20133). I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (recent observed average \u22482 periods). I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7sample std from all samples, letting it incorporate the full historical demand profile; this balances service (high profit vs low holding cost) with observed demand volatility and pipeline uncertainty.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Current on-hand=19, in-transit=279 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133); average of observed lead times \u22481.82 so I use a calculated L to capture actual pace. Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 20 (sustained high weekly sales through Period 36); I therefore use a recent_N forecast using the latest regime-length (~17 recent samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory for the current high-demand, higher-variance regime while the calculated L reflects observed lead-time drift. This balances service level (avoid stockouts during high demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=390 \u2014 large pipeline but recent history shows demand regime uplift since Period 20 (carry-over). Lead time observations vary (1\u20133); average recent observed lead_time \u22481.82 so use calculated average to let backend capture actual variability. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 20, so use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the elevated regime (N=18 covers Periods20\u201337 recent regime). These choices aim to raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; using calculated L prevents underordering when actual lead times exceed promised.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Current on-hand=81, in-transit=291. Historical arrivals show variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods) with recent concluded leads often 1\u20133; to be responsive to recent variability I use a recent-N estimate for lead time. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime since Period 20; recent weekly demand is volatile, so I base demand mean and volatility on the most recent 5 observed demand periods to capture current level and dispersion (periods 34\u201338: demands = 210,67,60,74,30). These choices balance service (capture recent high mean) against holding cost by using a short recent window rather than the full historical series.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=384. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed lead_times = {2,1,2,1,1,3,3,2,1,3,1,1}, avg\u22481.75) so I let the backend compute an empirical average (calculate). Demand has undergone regime shifts (low mid-year then sustained higher demand since Period20); to capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L) scaling uses the most recent 20 demand samples and reflects current volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat to cover elevated recent demand and variable lead times) against holding cost by relying on the backend capped-order logic. No single-period non-concluded arrivals are over-interpreted; using recent 20 samples smooths spikes while responding to the sustained post-Period20 increase.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=411. Recent demand has risen markedly versus earlier months (last 5 demands: 60,74,30,159,190; mean \u2248 106.6). Lead times in history are variable (observed values include 1,2,3), so I'll let backend compute an empirical average from observed concludes. To react to the recent uptick while limiting holding cost, I use a short recent-window forecast for demand (last 5 weeks) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime; L set to 'calculate' so the OR engine averages observed lead times rather than trusting the promised 2. This balances higher service level for the recent demand spike while capping orders per the OR engine's cap to avoid excessive holding given $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 36: recent mean (Periods 36\u201340) \u2248106.6 vs prior regime mean (Periods 20\u201335) \u224881.3 (+31%), sustained for 5 periods

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand is in the high regime that began at Period 36 (Periods 36\u201340 avg \u2248106.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=410 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) with average \u22481.77; therefore set L by calculate (avg observed). For demand forecast use recent regime: mu_hat recent_N with N=5 (captures Periods36\u201340 high-demand regime). For volatility likewise use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These settings keep base stock aligned with current high-demand regime while accounting for pipeline inventory and variable lead times.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent weeks show a pronounced, sustained demand spike starting Period 39 (periods 39\u201342 demands = 159,190,205,404). On-hand=0, in-transit=612 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (many 1\u20133); average used to capture actual variability. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time (~1.77) rather than the promised 2 so pipeline coverage reflects measured lead-time variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 39\u201342) so mu_hat reflects the spike; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect elevated volatility. These choices steer the OR engine toward higher base stock to meet the current elevated demand while sigma based on recent volatility tempers the safety stock to avoid excessive holding given large in-transit volumes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 39: avg increased from \u2248106.6 (Periods 36\u201340 prior) to \u2248239.5 (Periods 39\u201342), +125%, sustained 4 periods

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent demand regime: sustained spike beginning Period 39 (Periods 39\u201342 avg \u2248239.5 units/week) drives current high demand; Period 43 dipped but not yet a sustained reversal. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); using calculated average lead time to reflect realized variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most relevant high-demand regime (recent_N with N=4 -> Periods 39\u201342) so the OR backend targets service for the elevated demand; in-transit (916) + on-hand (46) is ample now but parameters ensure continued replenishment for the high-volume weeks while holding cost ($1) is moderate. Methods chosen: L=calculate, mu_hat=recent_N (N=4), sigma_hat=recent_N (N=4).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent history shows a strong, sustained high-demand regime beginning around Period 39 (recent weekly demands: P39\u2013P44 = 159,190,205,404,73,129) and large in-transit balance (1000 units) with on-hand 0. Lead times have varied historically (1\u20133), but promised lead time is 2 and most recent concluded arrivals support multi-period variability; no new definitive lead-time confirmation in the latest conclude. I set L to default (promised=2) so the OR backend uses contract lead time while relying on my demand estimates to absorb variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current elevated regime (use last 6 observed demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=6) to capture recent volatility (sqrt(1+L)*std of last 6 samples). These choices prioritize matching the backend to the confirmed high-demand regime while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with contract to avoid overcorrecting for sporadic delays; large in-transit inventory will cap ordering via the backend policy.

Demand has moved into a higher regime since late Oct/Nov with strong spikes in Nov\u2013Dec; to capture the current elevated demand I use a recent_N forecast over the most recent ~7 weeks (Periods 39\u201345) for both mean and volatility. This keeps inventory aligned to holiday-level demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent weeks show elevated demand vs earlier regimes (large spike around Period 42 with sustained high weekly sales in Periods 42\u201346). Current inventory: on-hand=377, in-transit=375 (total pipeline=752). I will infer lead time from historical concluded arrivals using the average of observed lead times to capture variability seen (1\u20133 periods observed). For demand forecast I focus on the most recent regime (Periods 42\u201346) using recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the current high-demand level across the review+lead window. Volatility has also increased with the recent spike, so I provide sigma_hat as recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices keep on-hand + pipeline compared to expected (1+L) periods of demand, aiming to balance service (capture current high demand) vs holding cost given already-large on-hand position.
