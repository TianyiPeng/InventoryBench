Lead time & pipeline: Promised LT=2, historical actuals varied but earlier carry-over confirms LT=2 in multiple instances; some lost shipments exist historically but current in-transit=3677 is large.

Demand regime: prior carry-over shows a sustained high-demand regime from P33 onward; recent weeks show moderate-high demand (~200s). Lead time & pipeline: lead time confirmed as 2 periods in history; current in-transit=2377 (existing pipeline) plus on-hand=1327 provides substantial coverage. Forecast & coverage: using a conservative forecast \u2248225/week and L=2 (need cover L+1=3 weeks) required \u2248675 units. Inventory position (on-hand 1327) already exceeds required coverage even allowing for a Christmas uplift. Risk: avoid additional ordering to prevent excess holding cost ($1/unit/period).
