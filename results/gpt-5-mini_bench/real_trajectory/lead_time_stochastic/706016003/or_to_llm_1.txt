Therefore the visible pipeline that will actually arrive is effectively 0; only on-hand 146 is reliably available. Demand & seasonality: Historical weekly samples (early-year) have mean \u2248509, but recent realized demand has decayed sharply (last 8 weeks: 131,120,55,59,121,45,46,59,58,45,26 with the most recent weeks very low ~26\u201359), consistent with a post-season slow period in June. Inventory policy reasoning: Promised lead time = 2 implies we must cover current + L future periods (3 weeks). Using recent low demand (~45\u201360/week) implies 3-week demand \u2248135\u2013180 units. On-hand 146 is roughly in that range and recent demand trend is downward, reducing urgency. OR recommended 0; given the substantial risk that the in-transit 1054 are lost (already documented) and the downward demand trend, placing an order now would likely create excess holding cost if demand remains low. Final action: follow OR and order 0 units. This avoids adding holding cost on a slow-demand regime while current on-hand roughly covers the (L+1)-period exposure given recent low demand.

{

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 921 and in-transit = 1304 (pipeline large). Recent demand is volatile but the sustained post-Period33 regime is higher; however on-hand + pipeline already cover many weeks of elevated demand (e.g., recent weekly demands: 627,143,283,247,89). Ordering risk: supplier has shown delayed/lost shipments historically, but current pipeline is already sizable so placing more orders risks high holding cost for marginal profit ($19 profit vs $1 holding/period).
