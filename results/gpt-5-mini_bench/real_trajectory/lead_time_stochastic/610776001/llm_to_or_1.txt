Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean = (145+144+105+181+212)/5 = 157.4. Promised lead time is 2 periods; with no evidence of lead-time or demand regime shifts, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding, relying on backend cap to limit order size.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=225 (order from P1 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals exist to override promised lead time (2). Demand history (samples through 2019-02-04) shows weekly demand baseline; no sustained changepoint detected. Use default lead time to respect promised L=2 and let backend infer mean over (1+L) periods. mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost and no strong evidence to adjust forecasts or volatility. This also avoids overreacting to the outstanding in-transit order which may still arrive on-time or be lost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=459 (orders from P1/P2) and two consecutive concluded periods show arrived=0 \u2192 shipments delayed beyond promised L=2. Demand history (Jan weekly samples) mean\u2248157.4. To hedge against continued delays I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods (conservative increase). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving statistical grounding while increasing coverage for the longer lead time. This increases target base-stock to cover (L+1) periods given probable late arrivals and balances service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. History shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 (225,234,245) but no arrivals in their conclude messages despite promised L=2. In-transit=704 confirms outstanding pipeline. I treat this as a confirmed lead-time/drift risk and set L explicit=3 to be conservative (captures longer arrival lag). For demand I use default aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), which leverages full historical sample set while accounting for the longer review+lead horizon. This increases target base-stock to cover the extra period of demand and balances the profit/holding tradeoff given equal profit and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (225,234,245) produced arrived=0 at their expected arrival windows for promised L=2, indicating lead time >=3 or lost/delayed shipments; in-transit shows 704 units outstanding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $234.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=557; recent concluded history shows one confirmed arrival: order on Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (observed lead_time=2). Orders from Periods 1 and 3 were delayed/missing but only one concluded lead-time sample exists, so use calculated lead time based on observed lead times. Demand history (weekly samples) still anchors forecast; use recent_N=5 to capture the baseline mean across available samples. sigma_hat left as default to reflect full-sample volatility. These choices balance service (use observed lead time=2) against holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has risen vs Jan baseline: Periods 3-5 demands = 350, 260, 245 (mean=285), showing a higher recent regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=761 which likely covers multiple lead periods but several earlier orders were delayed/missing so we cannot rely on immediate arrivals. Observed concluded lead time evidence: Period 4 conclude shows order from Period 2 arrived with lead_time=2. I choose L by calculating average of observed lead times to let backend use confirmed evidence (method=calculate). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 3-5) to capture the new higher-demand regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean_recent which increases target base stock to improve service given frequent stockouts. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting elevated recent demand while acknowledging holding cost parity with profit ($1 profit, $1 holding) by using short recent window rather than all-time average.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=651. Recent concluded lead times: Period4 showed LT=2 (P2\u2192P4), Period6 showed LT=1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 variable lead time. Demand has clearly shifted upward recently (Periods 2\u20136: 239,350,260,245,242). To capture observed LT variability use calculate (average observed). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the new higher regime; use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (reflecting higher recent demand) while letting the OR backend compute base-stock and cap given the inferred lead time and recent demand statistics, and they help mitigate risk from the previously missing/delayed shipments by relying on recent realized demand rather than older low-volume samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=802; recent history shows mixed lead times (observed arrivals: P2\u2192arrived in P4 => LT=2; P5\u2192arrived in P6 => LT=1) and several missing/delayed shipments (orders P1,P3,P7 had no conclude). I choose to let the backend infer a data-driven effective lead time (calculate) to capture the observed variability rather than forcing the promised L=2. Demand shows no sustained regime shift (single high demand at P7 only), so use default demand and volatility estimators to leverage all samples. This balances service (by letting backend adjust L from observed lead times) with holding cost avoidance (default mu_hat avoids overreacting to single spikes).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has risen sharply (recent sold/demand: P4-P8 = 260,245,242,448,382) indicating a higher demand regime vs. Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=557; some early orders (P1=225, P3=245) have never concluded and are likely lost, so pipeline is unreliable. Observed concluded lead times in history = [2 (P4), 1 (P6), 2 (P8), 1 (P8)] \u2192 use a recent average to reflect variability. Set L to recent_N to let backend average recent observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N over the last 5 demand periods to capture the elevated demand and volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service given high recent demand while sigma_hat based on recent variability limits over-ordering given possible lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed: orders placed Period 1 (225 units) and Period 3 (245 units) have not arrived by Period 9 (no conclude), indicating likely lost shipments.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has shifted materially higher vs the Jan samples (recent 5-period mean ~320 units/week, frequent spikes 300-450). On-hand=0, in-transit=947 but history shows multiple missing/lost shipments (Periods 1-3 orders never concluded) and observed lead times alternating 1\u20132 periods (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1]). I set L to recent_N over the last 4 observed lead-time samples to capture the 1\u20132 period variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N over the last 5 demand samples (periods 5\u20139) to capture the new high-demand regime; this raises the base-stock (1+L)*mean and increases safety stock to improve service given lost/delayed shipments. This balances profit vs holding cost by using recent high-demand estimates while letting the OR backend cap orders via its cap formula.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has shifted well above the Jan-Feb samples (recent weekly demands: 206,239,350,260,245,242,448,382,284,273) \u2014 sustained higher regime. On-hand=117, in-transit=571; earlier Periods 1 and 3 shipments remain missing (likely lost) but recent arrivals show mostly 1\u20132 period lead times. I set L to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent mix of 1\u20132 period realizations (gives avg ~1.4) rather than blindly using promised 2. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=10) to base demand forecast and volatility on the last 10 observed demands (captures the new higher-demand regime). These choices make the OR engine size base stock to meet the current elevated demand while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering for an assumed longer lead time.

History shows mixed lead times (observed W={2,1,2,1,1} \u2192 avg\u22481.4) and some lost shipments (P1,P3) but most concluded arrivals occur within 1\u20132 periods. Demand has been volatile but no clear, sustained demand regime shift. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let the backend infer the recent average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L). This keeps the policy responsive to the empirically short lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has shifted well above the historical 2019 Jan baseline: last 5 period demands = [382,284,273,410,345], mean \u2248 339 units/week. Pipeline is large (in-transit=774) but on-hand=0; earlier missing/lost shipments are known but recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times \u22481\u20132 periods. To capture the recent high-demand regime while reflecting the observed short/variable lead times, I set L to recent_N (average of last 5 observed lead times) and set demand forecasts (mu_hat, sigma_hat) using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) periods using the most relevant recent demand samples. This raises target inventory to avoid stockouts during high demand while the large in-transit quantity limits additional ordering aggressiveness.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent weekly demand is volatile (many weeks >200\u2013400 units); on-hand=0, in-transit=826 (large pipeline but some earlier orders were delayed/lost). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1,2] \u2192 average 1.5, so use calculate to reflect actual faster/variable flow vs promised L=2. Demand shows no sustained regime shift (high variance but intermittent spikes), so use default full-sample forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat to stabilize orders. These choices let the OR backend adjust target inventory for an empirically shorter/variable lead time while keeping demand forecast conservative to limit holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent weekly demand has been high and variable (historic samples show means ~ 177 over provided pre-2019 weeks; realized weekly demands in history range 206\u2013448). On-hand=0, in-transit=814 (large pipeline; some earlier orders appear lost but many later orders have arrived with observed lead times of 1\u20132 periods). I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (recent concludes show a mix of 1 and 2, avg \u22481.57) instead of blindly using the promised 2. For demand and volatility I choose 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain but not definitively longer lead times. This approach handles the mixed 1\u20132 observed lead times while avoiding overreacting to missing/lost early shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=814; history shows variable actual lead times (observed: 2,1,2,1,1,2,2) with some earlier lost/delayed shipments. Recent lead-time evidence (last 5 observed) averages ~1.6, so use a recent-N estimate to adapt to this shorter-but-unstable lead-time. Demand has been high recently (most recent 5 demands: P11-P15 = 410,345,280,309,337) \u2014 I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the current elevated regime and reduce risk of stockouts given many in-transit but uncertain arrivals. Volatility likewise uses the most recent 5 periods. These choices aim to raise the backend base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current high demand while acknowledging lead-time variability and avoiding overcommitting given confirmed lost shipments.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=1009. History shows variable observed lead times (mostly 1\u20132 periods) and several earlier lost shipments; pipeline is large but uncertain. I set L="calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 period behavior while ignoring promised=2 rigidity). Demand has shifted higher and stabilized in recent weeks (periods 7\u201316 show consistently elevated weekly demand), so I use mu_hat and sigma_hat with recent_N (N=10) to base (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the last 10 demand observations. These choices bias orders toward matching current elevated demand while the calculate L helps the OR engine adjust for actual lead-time evidence; recent_N for mu/sigma limits dilution from early low-demand samples and balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Demand history shows higher, sustained weekly demand (~200\u2013400) vs. initial Jan samples. To balance service vs. holding cost while letting the backend use observed lead time data, set L by averaging observed lead times (captures 1\u20132 variability and lost shipments signal without overcommitting). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full samples, keeping forecasts robust to limited sample sizes and letting OR cap constrain orders against pipeline.

On-hand=0, in-transit=850 but history shows missing/lost shipments earlier; to be conservative on lead time we'll let the backend compute average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N=5 (last 5 periods) to capture the current higher-demand regime; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep base-stock responsive to the elevated recent mean while letting the OR engine estimate lead-time from observed arrivals, and reduce risk of understocking given confirmed past shipment losses.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=1034. Historical concluded lead times observed = [2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1] (avg 1.5) and several early orders never concluded (likely lost). Demand has shifted upward and remained high for many periods (sustained regime since Mar). To reflect mixed observed lead times and delayed/lost shipments use calculated average lead time. For demand forecasting use a recent-window estimate to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. Chosen methods: L=calculate to average observed lead times (handles 1\u20132 variability and partial losses); mu_hat=recent_N (N=20) to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and better match current demand level; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=20) to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices help the OR backend set a base stock aligned with recent high demand while acknowledging effective lead-time >1 and avoiding excessive inventory given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lost shipments confirmed: orders from Periods 1 and 3 have not concluded by Period 9 and are likely lost; sustained higher-demand regime since Mar (multiple periods with demand >> Jan baseline).

On-hand=0, in-transit=1028 (some earlier shipments likely lost but many arrivals show lead times of 1\u20132). I set L via recent_N=9 using the 9 concluded lead-time observations (avg \u22481.56) to reflect observed faster-than-promised but variable arrivals. For demand I use recent_N=15 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime since Mar for mu_hat and sigma_hat, allowing the OR engine to size base stock for (1+L) review+lead while using recent volatility. These choices balance service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given profit=holding so z* = 0.5 tradeoff.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=23, in-transit=844; history shows many arrivals with mixed lead times and several lost/delayed shipments earlier, and sustained higher-demand regime since Mar. Infer lead time from recent observed conclues (mix of 1s and 2s) using recent_N to give weight to latest behavior. Demand has clearly shifted up vs. Jan baseline, so use recent_N demand window to capture the new regime and recent volatility. Chosen: L as recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent average lead_time \u22481.8; mu_hat recent_N (N=10) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over recent higher-demand periods; sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to capture recent volatility. These settings raise target base-stock to protect service during elevated demand while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering for older lost shipments.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Mar (many periods with demand >> Jan baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=855 (some earlier orders likely lost but many arrivals show lead times of 1\u20132). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 period behavior, avoids trusting promised L=2 blindly). For demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent ~20 periods (captures the post-Mar higher-demand regime). This balances service (capture elevated mean) against holding cost by using recent-data estimates rather than the low Jan baseline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=902 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times observed = mix of 1 and 2 periods (several recent 2s); average observed lead time used to better reflect variability vs promised L=2, so set L via calculate. Demand has shifted up since Mar (sustained higher demand regime); to capture the recent regime I use recent_N for demand moments with N=20 (captures recent ~5 months). Using recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a base stock tuned to the higher recent mean and observed lead-time behavior while capping orders via its cap to limit excess inventory given holding cost = profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=902. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20132 periods) with some lost shipments; average observed lead time \u22481.6. Recent demand shows a sustained downward shift in summer (Periods 21\u201326). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture the mixed 1\u20132 behavior. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the current summer regime (most relevant for (1+L) forecasting) and reduce influence of earlier higher-demand months. These parameters balance service (capture recent lower demand) while avoiding overstock from in-transit uncertainty and past lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg demand fell from ~280 (Periods 1\u201320) to ~156 (Periods 21\u201326), a -44% drop; lost shipments from Periods 1 and 3 remain unresolved (likely lost).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand regime since Period 21 is lower (~111\u2013223, avg ~156) versus earlier high-demand periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=855 (some prior shipments likely lost but many concluded arrivals later). To respect promised lead time and because concluded lead-time observations still cluster around 1\u20132, keep L as default (promised=2). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 21\u201327, 7 samples) so the OR engine sizes orders to the new, lower demand and avoids excess holding cost given equal profit/holding. This balances service vs holding given large in-transit and reduced demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent data show a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 21 (avg demand ~156 over P21\u2013P28) versus earlier high demand; several early orders appear lost but many concluded lead times cluster ~1\u20132 (avg ~1.64). On-hand=0, in-transit=855 (some may be lost). To reflect the confirmed demand drop I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (focus on the post-change regime) and match sigma_hat to the same recent window. For lead time I use the calculated average of observed lead times (uses concluded arrivals) so the OR engine models actual speed. These choices reduce overstating demand and inventory while allowing the engine to compute a base-stock consistent with observed lead times and recent lower variance/mean.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has stayed in the lower regime since Period 21 (weeks 21\u201329 show consistently lower demand vs earlier periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=855 (includes old likely-lost shipments but arrivals since Period 21 follow promised L=2). I keep L=default (promised 2) because concluded arrivals continue to show 1\u20132 period leads and lost shipments are historical anomalies; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the current low-demand regime. I choose N=9 (Periods 21\u201329) to cover the full recent regime length, so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std will reflect the lower demand and reduce overstock given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09): recent demand has settled into the lower regime since Period 21 (avg ~156 earlier, recent weeks much lower). On-hand=0, in-transit=855 with multiple long-unresolved shipments (Periods 1&3 likely lost) \u2014 evidence of occasional lead-time > promised or lost shipments. To be conservative and cover delayed arrivals, set lead time explicit=3. For demand forecast use a recent-N window capturing the new low-demand regime: recent_N N=6 (Periods 25\u201330 demands = 111,96,84,110,109,74) so mu_hat uses these recent samples scaled by (1+L). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect current lower volatility. These parameters raise the pipeline cover for delayed arrivals while sizing orders to the lower post-changepoint demand, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has shifted down since Period 21 (weekly demands mostly ~70\u2013223, recent 11-period avg much lower than early-year baseline). There is large in-transit (855) and historical evidence of delayed/lost shipments, but concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 1\u20132 in many recent cases. I choose L='calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded messages. For demand I use recent_N (N=11) to reflect the new lower-demand regime (Periods 21\u201331) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=11) so safety stock reflects recent variability. These settings reduce overstating demand from the high-demand early-year regime while letting the OR engine account for observed lead-time behaviour.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been in the lower post-change regime since Period 21 (weeks Jul onward); last 12 concluded periods show low weekly demand (roughly 70\u2013173, average ~80\u2013160 range). On-hand=0, in-transit=855 (large outstanding pipeline that includes earlier delayed/lost shipments). Historical concluded lead times are a mix of 1 and 2 periods; to let the backend infer the typical lead-time from observed concludes I request it 'calculate' average observed lead time. To reflect the sustained downward demand regime starting Period 21 I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (regime length from P21\u2013P32 = 12; N chosen per rules). These settings bias orders toward the lower recent demand while letting the OR engine estimate lead time from observed concludes and cap orders with its cap logic, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding=$1.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (weeks 21\u201333 show sustained lower weekly demand vs earlier periods). Multiple earlier shipments remain lost/delayed but recent concluded arrivals mostly show 1\u20132 period lead times. To capture the current low-demand regime I set L to be inferred from observed lead-time history (calculate) and used recent_N=13 for demand mean/volatility (coverage = review+lead). This biases orders down to match the sustained lower-demand regime while letting the backend compute base stock and caps using observed lead-time behavior; it also avoids overstocking given $1 profit & $1 holding cost and unresolved lost shipments.

On-hand=0, in-transit=855 with several earlier orders confirmed lost/delayed \u2014 concluded arrivals show actual lead times varying 1\u20132 periods. To reflect the empirically observed lead time distribution I use calculate (average observed lead_time \u22481.64). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 21\u201334, length 14) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower current demand and its volatility; this keeps base-stock small to avoid holding cost while meeting current service needs given uncertain in-transit status.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=855. History shows many delayed/lost early shipments (Periods 1\u20133) but subsequent arrivals exhibit mostly 1\u20132 period lead times. Demand regime dropped starting Period 21 (2019/7) and recent demand (Periods 21\u201335) is substantially lower than early periods. I set L using 'calculate' so backend infers the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals while accounting for lost earlier orders). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=15 (the recent low-demand regime from Period 21\u201335) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of those recent samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=15 to reflect reduced volatility in the new regime. These choices reduce overstock risk from basing forecasts on earlier high-demand periods while letting the backend set L from empirical arrival evidence, improving service vs. holding-cost tradeoff given likely lost early shipments and a sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has settled into a low regime since Period 21 with especially low weekly sales in Periods 30\u201336 (\u224834\u201374). Many prior shipments appear lost/delayed (large in-transit=855) so do not trust pipeline to protect service. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures observed 1\u20132 period arrivals while ignoring missing/lost shipments). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, anchoring forecast to the last 7 observed demands (Periods 30\u201336 plus Period 29) to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and reduce overstock risk. This reduces target base-stock and holding costs while accepting lower service for unlikely high demand spikes given current low realized demand and probable lost in-transit units.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (weekly demands ~34\u2013111 vs earlier ~280\u2013400). On-hand=0, in-transit=855 (some earlier shipments confirmed lost historically). Observed concluded lead times (recent 5 concluded arrivals) average \u22481.8 periods, so I use recent_N for L with N=5 to capture the currently observed faster-than-promised behavior while remaining robust to noise. For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (covers the sustained low-demand regime from Period 21\u201337) so mu_hat reflects current lower demand. Sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=17 to capture current volatility in the low-demand regime. These choices reduce overstating replenishment against the new lower-demand baseline while accounting for observed lead-time shortening in recent arrivals, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has fallen sharply since Period ~27; last 12 periods (P27\u2013P38) average demand \u224865.8 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=855 (includes earlier likely-lost shipments), so pipeline is large but arrivals are uncertain. Observed concluded lead times vary (mostly 1\u20132 periods) so I use calculated average lead time. To reflect the new low-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 12 samples (P27\u2013P38) so the backend bases base_stock on current lower mean/volatility while L is estimated from observed lead-time history.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=855; several earlier shipments remain unresolved but concluded lead-times (11 observations) average ~1.64. Demand has fallen and stayed low since early Sep. Set L by calculating observed average lead time to reflect realized supplier speed (< promised 2). Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime (most recent 10 demand samples since the Sept changepoint) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to the current lower demand and reduces holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30 (2019/09/02): avg demand fell from ~156 (Periods 21\u201326) to ~64 (Periods 30\u201339), a -59% decline (sustained over 10+ periods).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Recent demand has fallen sharply since Period 30 (sustained low weekly demand ~24\u201374). On-hand=0, in-transit=855 (large outstanding likely includes older lost/delayed shipments). Promised L=2 remains plausible given mixed observed lead times (1\u20132) and many lost earlier shipments; I will use default promised lead time to avoid overestimating L from unresolved lost shipments. For demand I use recent_N over the stable low-demand regime starting Period 30 (regime length \u224811 weeks) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current low mean/volatility and keep inventory lean versus holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Observed historical concluded lead times vary (mostly 1\u20132, some missing/lost shipments earlier) and average lead time appears between 1 and 2. Demand has undergone sustained decline since Period 30 (recent regime: Periods 30\u201341 low demand). To capture true lead-time behavior I request the backend 'calculate' average of observed lead times. For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N based on the current low-demand regime (Periods 30\u201341) to avoid legacy high-demand data inflating targets; N=12 covers the recent 12-week low-demand window and keeps safety stock aligned with current demand and holding cost parity (profit=holding cost). This reduces overstock risk given large in-transit volume (855) and likely lost older shipments.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand regime is low since Period 30 (weekly demand ~24\u201374, avg much lower than early-year peaks). On-hand=0, in-transit=855 (large outstanding pipeline; several early orders likely lost but many concluded arrivals show mixed lead times of 1\u20132). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,2,2] \u2192 avg \u22481.4, so I let the backend compute a data-driven average (method=calculate) for L. For demand I use a recent-regime estimate: changepoint at Period 30 (sustained lower demand), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (Periods 30\u201342) to capture current lower mean and volatility. This focuses ordering on the current low-demand regime while letting the backend cap orders given the large in-transit volume, balancing service vs holding costs.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 30 (sustained low weekly demand ~30-75 units). Historical concluded lead-times are a mix of 1 and 2 periods (no sustained shift), but earlier missing/lost shipments exist and in-transit remains high (855). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend averages observed concluded lead-times (uses evidence only from concluded messages). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (the post-changepoint regime from Period 30\u201343) so mu_hat reflects the sustained low-demand regime. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=14 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices down-weight the earlier high-demand periods and account for confirmed sustained low demand while letting the backend handle pipeline arithmetic and cap constraints.

Recent demand regime: sustained low-demand since Period 30 (~Nov\u2013Dec) vs earlier high-demand; on-hand=0, in-transit=855 (many outstanding orders, some likely lost earlier). Observed concluded lead times (11 samples) average \u22481.64 periods \u2192 use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead times. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N (last 15 periods, Periods 30\u201344) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes replenishment to current lower mean and volatility while still accounting for the review+lead horizon. This approach avoids overstocking given large in-transit volume and known missing/lost shipments by tying forecasts to the recent low-demand regime.

Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 30 (~2019-09-02) with weekly demand mostly in the 20\u201380 range; use recent data to avoid overstating demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=855 (large pipeline that may cover many weeks). Observed concluded lead times are mostly 1\u20132 periods; I let the backend calculate the average observed lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent low-demand regime (last 16 weeks, Periods 30\u201345) so the OR engine targets a base stock aligned with the current lower demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit. These choices balance service level (use recent demand evidence) against holding cost and account for the large in-transit pipeline.

Historical concluded lead-times (from conclude messages) show mostly 1\u20132 periods (average \u22481.64), with several lost shipments earlier but no new evidence of longer systematic delays. To reflect the empirically observed lead time I select 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate over the current low-demand regime (Periods 30\u201346, length 17) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower mean and volatility; this keeps target base-stock small and limits holding costs while matching current demand.
