Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Recent historical weekly demand (5 samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04) has mean ~102.4 and moderate variability; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 with no concluded arrivals so no evidence of lead-time or demand regime change. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample; this balances service level against holding cost given no new signals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent weekly demand history (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) shows mean ~102.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=116 (Period 1 ordered 116 arrived=0) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer actual lead time; the Period 1 order is overdue relative to arrival visibility but single missing conclude is expected given promised lead time. Use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. This keeps forecasting anchored to historical weekly demand while the in-transit shipment is monitored; if arrivals fail to conclude in future periods, switch to an explicit/recent lead-time estimate.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=230; two prior orders (P1=116, P2=114) show arrived=0 in conclude messages but this alone is insufficient to confirm a lead-time shift. Demand history (2019-01 weekly samples mean=102.4) used. To avoid overreacting to possible shipment delay/loss before sustained evidence, use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend balances service vs holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded periods show orders placed in P1\u2013P3 have not yet concluded as arrivals (orders placed in P1 would have been visible by P3 if lead time=2), and in-transit shows 364 units uncertainly pending. To be conservative against further delays/lost shipments I set lead time explicitly to 3 to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline. Demand history (Jan weekly samples mean=102.4) is limited and shows no clear recent regime shift, so I use default demand/volatility calculations based on all samples so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std automatically. This raises target base-stock to protect service level given potential longer lead time while relying on default sigma to reflect historical volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1666.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demand samples average ~102.4 units/week (samples: 110,107,94,107,94). Promised lead time = 2; one concluded arrival shows an order from P2 arrived in P4 (lead_time=2) so no strong evidence to change lead time. On-hand + in-transit = 25 + 390 = 415 units, which comfortably exceeds the (1+L)-period demand forecast ((1+2)*102.4 \u2248 307). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock and caps appropriately given historical stats.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand samples (historical weekly: 110,107,94,107,94) imply avg ~102.4/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=390 (orders from P1,P3,P4). Only one concluded arrival shows lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4); other outstanding orders remain in-transit and may be delayed/lost. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (keeps confirmed 2 where available) rather than blindly trusting promised; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, providing a balanced base-stock that covers review+lead demand and leverages the known demand stats while avoiding overfitting to the small recent sample. This approach hedges against the in-transit uncertainty by sizing targets to the long-run mean demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=390. Historical weekly demand (Jan samples) mean=102.4 but recent realized demand shows uptick: Period4=89, Period5=92, Period6=102. One concluded arrival shows an actual lead time=2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). Pipeline (390) covers upcoming needs but several earlier orders never concluded, so rely on observed lead-time. I set L by calculating observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed actual lead time=2. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 4-6) for (1+L)-period demand. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias stocking toward recent higher demand while using confirmed lead-time to avoid underordering given missing earlier arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period2 order arrived in Period4)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent observed demands (P4..P7 = 89,92,102,173) show a one-period spike (173) but not a sustained regime shift (need \u22653 periods). Carry-over from Period 7 confirmed actual lead time = 2. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=390 which exceeds expected (1+L)\xd7historical mean, so no adjustment needed. I therefore use default lead time (promised), default demand forecast based on all samples, and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base_stock while avoiding overreaction to a single high-demand week.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has risen sharply (last five demands: 89, 92, 102, 173, 195) indicating a new higher-demand regime. On-hand=0 but in-transit=409 units (large pipeline) which should cover upcoming periods; avoid inflating long-term forecast but capture recent demand pattern for appropriate replenishment. Use L=default (promised lead time 2) since lead time was previously confirmed and matches promise. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent upward demand regime while backend will cap orders against current large pipeline to limit extra holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has stepped up sharply: last 5 observed demands = [92,102,173,195,152] (mean 142.8), vs historical mean ~102. On-hand=0, in-transit=533 (large pipeline). Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods; I'll use L=2 explicitly. To react to the new higher-demand regime while accounting for the 2-period promise, I set mu_hat using the recent 5-period mean scaled by (1+L)=3 (method recent_N, N=5). Volatility will also use the recent 5 samples to capture increased variability (recent_N, N=5). These choices raise the base stock to meet higher demand and keep stockouts low while the OR backend will cap orders to avoid excessive overordering given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=1, in-transit=413 (large pipeline). Observed lead times: 2 (P2->P4), 2 (P8->P10), 1 (P9->P10) => mixed but recent average ~1.67; choose recent_N to capture recent variation. Demand has shifted up recently (see carry_over_insight) so use recent_N for demand mean/variance over last 5 periods to reflect current regime. These settings keep base-stock responsive to elevated demand while capping orders via OR cap to limit excess holding given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: recent mean of Periods 6-10 = 152.8 vs historical sample mean = 102 (+50%), sustained for 5 periods

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand regime elevated since Period 7 (sustained ~+50% vs historical). On-hand=0, in-transit=557 which covers ~3 periods of elevated demand (3\xd7~153\u2248459), so pipeline suffices. Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods; use promised/default L. To reflect the sustained higher demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent regime using the last 5 periods (to capture the shift while keeping sample size >=3). This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): recent demand has clearly shifted up (Period 6-10 mean = 152.8 vs historical sample mean \u2248102; sustained 5 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=563 units (large pipeline). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods in history. I therefore keep L as promised (default=2) and set demand estimates using the recent regime to reflect the sustained higher demand: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This biases orders toward the higher recent demand while the large in-transit volume reduces immediate ordering aggressiveness, mitigating risk of excess holding cost and covering potential lost/delayed shipments.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=432. Historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift starting around Period 7 (recent mean ~153 vs historical 102) and recent weeks (Periods 9-13) remain elevated (152,142,176,187,198 \u2192 avg \u2248171). Lead time has been observed as 2 periods repeatedly. To capture the higher recent demand while letting the OR engine account for promised lead time, I set L to default (promised=2). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 weeks (captures the new regime). This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given strong recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N propagates current volatility into safety stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 7 (confirmed earlier) and multiple observed lead times (1 and 2 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=581 (large pipeline). I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures observed 1s and 2s rather than blindly using promised). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (periods 7\u201315, regime_length=9) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean across the review+lead horizon. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=9 to reflect the recent volatility in the same regime. These choices keep orders responsive to the confirmed higher demand while letting the OR backend cap orders using its cap formula; using recent regime stats reduces stockouts while avoiding unnecessary long-term overstock given the large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=581 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to weekly demand. Historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift upward since Period 7 (recent weeks ~150\u2013198). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 in prior conclues. To reflect the higher recent demand and keep service while controlling holding cost, I set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the base-stock calculation on the last 10 weeks of demand.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand elevated vs historical: sustained higher regime beginning Period 7 (many periods of ~140-198 demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=574 which provides substantial cover. Actual lead time confirmed=2 in history. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirms 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (regime from Period 7\u201317, length 11) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean across the review+lead period. Sigma uses recent_N N=11 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the base stock up to avoid stockouts in the new higher-demand regime while accounting for observed lead time and current pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been elevated vs. historical (sustained shift starting Period 7). On-hand=0 but large pipeline=574 units (covers many future periods). Promised lead time was 2 and prior concludes confirmed actual=2. Use L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed evidence). Use mu_hat recent_N to focus the forecast on the elevated demand regime (capture last 12 periods to cover the post-changepoint data). Use sigma_hat default (population std across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)); large in-transit stock reduces short-term stockout risk, so relying on recent mean for demand is sufficient to balance service vs. holding cost.

Observed concluded lead times are consistently 2 periods (mostly), but one 1-period event\u2014use calculated lead time to let backend average observed lead times.

Historical data show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 7; recent realized weekly demand has moderated but remains above the very-early-sample mean. Use promised lead time (default=2) since lead time was previously confirmed at 2 and no new conclude messages suggest change. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should be based on the most recent 5 demand observations to capture the current regime while remaining responsive to recent moderation; this balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has been at the higher regime noted in carry-over (sustained ~150s+ since Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=592 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 and historical concludes confirm LT=2. Use default LT (promised) to keep OR engine aligned with supplier promise. For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent mean (regime confirmed Period 11) so mu_hat reflects current higher demand. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to measure volatility over the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service (capture higher demand) while using pipeline buffer to limit excess ordering and holding cost exposure.

Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Forecast demand using recent sample window to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use recent_N over the most recent regime since Period 7). Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These settings balance service (protect against stockouts under the new higher mean) vs holding cost by limiting the window to the sustained regime rather than all historical low-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=592 (large pipeline). Historical data shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 7 (recent mean ~153 vs historical 102). Promised lead time is 2 and prior concludes confirmed LT=2. To reflect the sustained higher demand while letting the OR engine use recent demand, set L to default (promised=2). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture the post-changepoint regime (sustained >3 periods) so the base-stock targets service the higher demand; sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated volatility. Large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency but parameters reflect higher demand to avoid stockouts once pipeline depletes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, In-transit=592 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to elevated demand. Historical data and prior carry-over confirm lead time=2 and a sustained demand regime increase since Period 7. I keep L as promised (default) since actual lead time has been confirmed as 2 previously and no new lead-time evidence appears. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (periods since the changepoint) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean over the recent regime. Volatility uses default to let backend scale std over (1+L). These choices give the OR engine a demand forecast tuned to the sustained higher regime while relying on the confirmed lead time; with current in-transit stock the policy will avoid aggressive new ordering.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=592 (large pipeline). Recent demand (Periods 23-27) averaged ~145.8/week, well above historical Jan samples (~102) and consistent with the previously recorded sustained uplift. Promised lead time is 2 and historical concludes support L\u22482; I keep default promised lead time to let backend assume 2. Given the sustained higher recent demand, I set mu_hat using a recent_N window to capture the current regime (N=5 weeks). Volatility has also shifted with the regime change, so sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current variability. These choices ensure the OR backend targets the elevated demand regime while the large in-transit stock will cap orders via the backend cap to avoid overstocking.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Product is a womens cardigan; recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 7 (previously recorded). On-hand=0, in-transit=592 (significant pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and historical concludes support LT=2. I set L=default to use promised lead time. Demand forecasting uses recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (regime length ~22 periods since Period 7, capped at 20). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward to meet elevated demand while sigma based on recent variability controls safety stock and holding tradeoff; existing large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand remains above historical sample mean but has moderated vs the peak after Period 7. On-hand=0, in-transit=592 (sizable pipeline). Use L=default (promised 2) because concluded history confirms 2 and no new contrary evidence. Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=10) to capture the most recent 10-week demand regime (weights current elevated mean while avoiding overreacting to short spikes). Set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep the backend base-stock responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while capping orders via the OR engine to avoid excess holdings given the large in-transit volume.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=592. Historical demand shows a sustained upward regime starting Period 7 (recorded earlier). Recent weeks remain elevated with volatility and a large spike in Period 30 (271). Promised lead time is 2 and prior concluded messages confirm LT=2; I keep L=default to align with supplier promise. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing recent volatility, I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std over the most recent 20 demand samples. This balances service level for the higher-demand regime versus holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 7 (sustained increase); to capture the current regime I use the recent 20 samples to set demand mean and volatility so the OR backend sizes base stock for the elevated demand (reduces stockouts) while holding cost ($1) remains small relative to profit ($19).

Promised lead time is 2 and prior concluded arrivals confirm LT=2. To capture the sustained higher demand regime and recent surge (last 10 weeks mean \u2248167.9), set L to default (promised=2) so backend uses known lead time, use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 to forecast the (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent regime, and use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level during elevated demand while acknowledging substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent demand has been materially higher than the historical 2019-Jan samples; prior carry-over confirmed a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 7 (recent mean ~152.8 vs historical ~102). On-hand=0, in-transit=673 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but actual arrivals are observed with a 1-period observation delay. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 2) since lead time was previously confirmed as 2 and no new evidence of change is present. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the most recent 20 demand observations to compute (1+L)*mean). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent variability. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts in the new higher-demand regime while using recent variability to size safety stock and control holding costs.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime (several weeks of 200+ to 360+ units) versus historical baseline. On-hand=0, in-transit=683 \u2014 with promised L=2 the pipeline likely covers multiple weeks but arrival timing uncertain. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (2) since concluded lead-time evidence remains consistent historically. For demand I choose recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime in the most recent 10 weeks, so the OR backend will raise base-stock to meet elevated demand while controlling holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been well above historical sample mean since the shift detected at Period 7 (sustained higher regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=847 (large pipeline). Occasional delayed arrival (one observed lead_time=3 at P32->P35) but majority confirmed lead_time=2 earlier; not enough evidence to change lead-time assumption. I set L=default (use promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I use recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent variability. These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline and kept promised lead time limit over-ordering and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=10, in-transit=602. Historical concludes show actual lead times varying but average ~2; demand jumped around Period 7 and has remained elevated (documented previously). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I'll use a recent-window demand estimate while using observed lead-time averaging. L set to calculated average (uses concluded lead times). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained higher mean/volatility since the changepoint and cap window per rules. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given large in-transit but prevents under-forecasting; recent volatility preserves safety stock sizing.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28. Recent demand has been higher and more volatile since the regime shift identified at Period 7 (sustained). On-hand=0, in-transit=732 \u2192 substantial pipeline stock but arrivals will be observed with delay. Lead time observations vary (mix of 1\u20133); I use recent_N (last 5 observed lead times) to reflect the most recent mix (avg \u22482). For demand I use recent_N over the last 20 demand samples to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term spikes. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. These settings aim to keep base stock responsive to the higher demand regime while letting the large in-transit pipeline reduce immediate ordering aggressiveness.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=625. Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 2 periods (earlier confirmation) with occasional 3-period events, but no new sustained lead-time change since prior insight. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 7 (noted previously); to reflect elevated recent demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over a reasonably large recent window to capture current volatility and elevated mean. Using default L (promised lead time=2) keeps backend lead-time assumption aligned with contract while mu/sigma recent_N helps the OR engine raise base-stock for higher service given Profit=19 vs Holding=1.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=777 \u2014 substantial pipeline arriving in future. Historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 7 (noted previously); recent months show much higher weekly demand (Sept\u2013Oct spikes). Promised lead time is 2 and prior evidence confirms 2-period arrivals; use default lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures most recent behavior while capping N at 20 per rules). These settings let the OR backend size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods under the higher recent mean while reflecting recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=777. Historical data shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 7 (recorded in carry-over). Many recent weeks (Periods 30-40) show elevated and volatile demand vs the original small-sample history. I keep L as the promised/default (use the backend's promised lead time) because concluded lead-time evidence is mixed (some 2s and occasional 3s) and no new sustained lead-time change is confirmed. To align stocking with the recent elevated demand I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight recent periods more heavily (capture current higher mean and volatility). I choose N=20 to cover the most recent two dozen weeks (balances recency with sample size) so the OR engine's base stock and cap reflect current demand while the large in-transit quantity (777) will reduce immediate orders via the pipeline term.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=32, in-transit=628. Profit=$19, holding=$1 \u2192 very high target service level (q\u22480.95). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead times observed (mix of 1\u20133, average \u22481.9) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 7 (higher mean sustained). To capture the sustained higher demand and recent volatility, set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (use observed evidence rather than promised). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std based on the most recent 20 demand samples, which reflects the elevated regime and recent variability while limiting influence of older low-demand history. This balances high service level (few lost sales) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=747. Historical data and prior carry-over show a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 7 (higher mean ~153 vs historical ~102). Promised lead time is 2 and prior conclusions confirm LT=2; I use default L to keep backend's promised LT. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=20 (use last 20 demand samples to reflect the elevated mean since the changepoint). Volatility is also best estimated from the same recent window, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20. This raises base-stock to achieve a high service level (profit/holding -> q\u22480.95) while using recent demand statistics to avoid stockouts given many large in-transit quantities and elevated demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Item shows on-hand=0 and in-transit=775 units; promised lead time=2 and historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=2. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 7 (sustained higher mean); I therefore use recent data to forecast demand over the review+lead horizon. Set L to default (promised 2). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (20 most recent periods of the regime) so the OR engine builds a base-stock reflecting the elevated mean and updated volatility, balancing higher service level (profit $19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has been elevated vs historical (carry-over notes a sustained regime shift starting Period 7). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=777 (large pipeline). I will trust the promised lead time (default=2) and set demand estimates using recent data to capture the elevated regime. Chosen methods: L=default to keep promised 2-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to base the review+lead demand on the most recent 20 samples (captures recent high demand); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to use recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to target a higher base-stock reflecting the sustained higher demand while using recent variance to size safety stock; relying on pipeline=777 reduces urgent replenishment risk.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent observed demand regime elevated earlier in year and Dec weekly demand has moderate volumes; on-hand=14, in-transit=627 (large pipeline arriving soon). Many past arrivals show actual lead times varying but earlier confirmed LT=2; promised LT=2. To avoid over-ordering given large pipeline I use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma estimated from the most recent 5 demand observations to capture current seasonality. recent_N=5 keeps the forecast responsive while the OR cap will limit orders versus pipeline. This balances service level (cover short-term elevated demand) against holding cost given heavy in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:

Promised lead time is 2 and prior confirms support using promised lead time rather than forcing a different estimate. I set L=default to keep promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base-stock on the most recent 20 demand samples (captures recent elevated mean/variance while smoothing older low-demand history). This balances higher service level for the sustained demand lift against holding costs, while relying on the backend cap to limit order size if needed.
