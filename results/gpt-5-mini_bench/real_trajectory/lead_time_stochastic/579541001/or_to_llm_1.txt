Inventory analysis: on-hand=0, in-transit=330 which equals the sum of prior orders (116+114+100). Historical weekly demand (given samples) averages ~102 units/week; recent observed demands in concluded periods are higher (99, 140, 137) but with only three recent samples. Requirement calculation: with promised L=2, the (L+1)=3-period demand exposure at recent elevated demand (~125\u2013137) would be ~375\u2013411 units; current pipeline of 330 is short of that extreme but likely to arrive if delays are temporary. Decision rationale vs OR: OR recommends 55 units (it uses promised L and historical mean). Ordering now would increase exposure to holding cost ($1/unit/period) while arrivals from prior large orders are still outstanding and may yet fulfill demand. Given the uncertainty (delays but no confirmed lost shipments) and high holding cost relative to ordering no extra safety (we already have a large pipeline), I avoid placing additional orders to prevent potential overstock. Strategy: place 0 units now, monitor upcoming period concludes for actual arrivals; if orders fail to conclude in the next period(s), escalate ordering to cover confirmed shortfall.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & arrivals: Recent history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods) and many previously-placed orders eventually arriving; several shipments are overdue/lost earlier but current in-transit = 566 units is large relative to demand. Inventory balance: on-hand=0 but pipeline=566 likely to deliver over coming periods (historical arrivals commonly occur within 1\u20133 periods). Demand outlook: weekly demand has fallen from the earlier surge (Sept\u2013Oct) to ~105\u2013136 in the last three concluded periods (P44\u2013P46), so near-term demand is moderate. Cost trade-off: profit $19 >> holding $1, so some inventory is valuable, but with 566 units already in-transit we risk high holding cost on excess ending inventory if we add more. OR recommends 69 using promised L=2 and historical mean; given the large confirmed pipeline and recent demand moderation, I will not add more risk: order 0 this period to let in-transit inventory fulfill upcoming demand and avoid unnecessary holding costs. Final action: order 0 units.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Order 0 (instead of OR's 69) because in-transit=566 units will cover upcoming demand and recent weekly demand has moderated (~105\u2013136), so avoid extra holding cost.",
