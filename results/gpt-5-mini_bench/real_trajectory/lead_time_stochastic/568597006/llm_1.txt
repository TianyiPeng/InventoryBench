Lead time/pipeline: recent evidence (P35/P36 arrivals) confirms actual lead time \u2248 3 periods for large orders; pipeline has had prior unreliable/lost shipments but recent large orders did arrive on a 3-period cadence. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=1134 units. With lead time=3, must cover (L+1)=4 weeks of demand after ordering; forecast 4\xd7120\u2248480 units needed. Current in-transit (1134) comfortably covers 4+ weeks of demand. Ordering more would increase ending inventory and incur $1 holding cost per unit/period with only $4 profit when sold, and risk excess stock given no near-term demand surge. Final action: do not place new order this period.",
