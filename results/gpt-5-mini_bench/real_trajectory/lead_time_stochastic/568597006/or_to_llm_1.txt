This strongly suggests either actual lead time > promised 2 periods or lost/delayed shipments, but we have no concluded arrival messages to confirm exact lead time or which orders (if any) will arrive. Inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=287 (these units may or may not arrive). Demand outlook: historical weekly samples (79,80,88,115,80) give single-period mean \u224888.4 and 3-period expected demand \u2248265.2. OR computed a capped order of 13 units using promised L and pipeline; given pipeline=287 > 3-period demand, OR recommends a small order. Decision: place 13 units. Reasoning: I follow OR's small order because the visible pipeline (287) exceeds expected (L+1)-period demand, so ordering large now risks holding cost if those units do in fact arrive. However, because three consecutive non-arrivals indicate a sustained supply problem, I still place a minimal order (13) to slightly top up in case some in-transit units are valid or to partially cover near-term risk if some of the 287 are lost. This balances avoiding excess holding cost (Holding=$1/unit/period) against stockout risk given uncertain arrivals. Short operational note: monitor upcoming conclude messages for any arrivals; if conclude continues to show no arrivals, escalate by increasing order quantities later to cover confirmed lost shipments.",

Demand regime: carry-over insights already confirm a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 31\u201337 avg \u2248241) so single-period demand is high, but 741 units in-transit cover multiple weeks. OR recommended 0 because its base-stock minus pipeline is \u22640 given large pipeline; I see no new confirmed lead-time/loss signal that would invalidate the pipeline volume (no recent conclude showing large losses). Trade-off: ordering more now only increases holding cost ($1/unit/period) while profit per unit is $4 \u2014 with 741 units already inbound, adding inventory risks unnecessary holding cost. Decision: follow OR and place 0 units. This preserves profit by avoiding excess holding cost while inbound supply should meet demand over coming weeks. If future concluded messages show missing arrivals (lost shipments) for several consecutive periods, I will revise and order proactively.",
