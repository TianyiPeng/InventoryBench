Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals observed yet. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean=4.8 and modest spread. Promised lead time is 2 periods and no evidence of lead-time or demand regime shifts, so use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample history while avoiding overreaction to limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013early Feb) show low mean (~4.8 units/week) but Period 1 demand reported 18 units \u2014 a single large spike. On-hand=0, in-transit=9 (order placed in P1; arrived=0 in P1 conclude). Promised lead time is 2; no concluded arrival yet so do NOT infer actual lead time or lost shipment. To be responsive to the recent spike while remaining conservative given limited evidence, keep L as default (promised=2). Use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to give moderate weight to the recent high demand without overreacting to a single period. Keep sigma_hat as default (use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These choices let the OR backend increase target stock to partially cover the observed spike while avoiding overstock if the spike is transient.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=31. Two prior orders (P1:9, P2:22) have not concluded (arrived=0) so actual lead time is unconfirmed; do NOT assume a lead-time change yet. Use promised lead time (default L=2). Historical weekly demand samples mean = 4.8 units; with (1+L)=3 the default mu_hat = 3\xd7mean (backend will compute). Demand std \u22482.28; with sqrt(1+L)=\u221a3 the default sigma_hat = \u221a(1+L)\xd7std (backend will compute). These default settings balance service level and holding cost conservatively while we wait for conclusive arrival evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3: 18,79,56) is far above historical pre-sample mean (~4.8), indicating a sustained demand spike. All orders placed in Periods 1-3 show arrived=0 in their conclude messages, so shipments are missing/delayed vs promised L=2; lacking confirmed alternative lead-time, I explicitly set L=3 to be conservative. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (use last 3 demand observations) so the OR backend targets inventory for the current higher-demand regime while acknowledging transport issues. This raises service level to capture spike but keeps sigma based on recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical avg=4.8 (five-sample) \u2192 recent avg=51 (Periods 1-3) (+~964%); Missing shipments: orders from Periods 1-3 did not arrive by promised lead time (arrived=0) \u2014 potential longer lead time or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent on-hands 0, in-transit 174. Demand has sharply increased vs. historical sample mean: Periods 1-4 demands = [18,79,56,71] (recent avg \u2248 56). Historical sample mean (five-sample) = 4.8 is no longer representative. One observed lead-time (Period2 order arrived in Period4) equals 2, so no confirmed lead-time shift. However several earlier orders remain in-transit (possible lost/delayed shipments) \u2014 be cautious but do not yet override promised lead time. Therefore: keep L as default (promised=2), set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 4 periods: Periods1-4), and set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same 4 most-recent periods to reflect increased variability. This raises the base-stock to meet the new demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock for variability and potential shipment delays.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has jumped sharply vs historical (recent period demands: P2=79, P3=56, P4=71, P5=88), signaling a sustained higher-demand regime; historical five-sample mean (Jan\u2013Feb) is ~4.8 and no longer representative. On-hand=0, in-transit=246; some earlier orders did not conclude (missing arrivals from P1,P3,P5) but we have one confirmed lead time observation of 2 (P2 order arrived in P4). I set L via calculate to use observed lead-time evidence (avg observed = 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 4 observed period demands) so the OR backend increases base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given strong demand) versus holding cost by basing forecasts on the confirmed new regime rather than low historical samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent realized demand is much higher than the Jan baseline (recent demands: 18,79,56,71,88,105) indicating a sustained demand regime shift upward. Observed concluded lead times = {2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6)}; some earlier orders still missing suggesting occasional lost shipments but no consistent >2 lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime, use recent_N=6 for demand mean and volatility (covers all six recent high-demand samples). For lead time, average the last 2 observed lead times to reflect recent variability (1\u20132 periods) rather than default promised value. These choices make mu_hat responsive to the new demand level while sigma_hat captures recent variability; L recent average reduces risk of over/under-ordering given mixed arrival evidence and helps the OR backend set a base-stock that balances $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded arrivals show actual observed lead times of 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6); several orders remain missing/delayed but evidence is mixed, so use calculated average lead time to let OR adapt to observed data. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean (all five samples mean=4.8) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a conservative forecast while accounting for inferred L. This balances service (capture recent higher demand vs. historical baseline) against holding cost given large in-transit volume (295 units) and uncertain arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has jumped markedly since Period 2 (multiple weeks of 56\u2013161 units), so I use a recent-sample forecast to capture the new high-demand regime. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1} (avg 1.5) so I let the backend compute an average via 'calculate'. On-hand=0, in-transit=174 \u2014 pipeline is large but past shipments have been intermittent; using recent_N for mu and sigma (N=6) focuses the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand periods to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has shifted sharply upward: Periods 1-9 demands = {18,79,56,71,88,105,110,161,108}, recent mean \u224888.4 vs historical mean 4.8. Pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=333 (likely covers several upcoming periods). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1} \u2192 avg=1.5; variability and some earlier delays observed. I set L to "calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1.5). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to base mu_hat on the confirmed high-demand regime (uses last 9 samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=9) to capture current demand volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine targets base stock appropriate for the new high-demand regime while reflecting the empirically observed lead time and variability; with in-transit=333 the order decision will be compared to pipeline to avoid over-ordering given holding cost $1/unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: historical avg=4.8 (five-sample) \u2192 recent avg=88.4 (Periods 1-9) (+~1740%); observed lead time average = 1.5 periods (observed lead_times: 2,1,2,1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand is much higher than the historical Jan samples (recent avg \u224888.4 over Periods 1-9) and shipments show variable lead times (observed lead_times = 2,1,2,1). On-hand=82, in-transit=221 (some early small orders appear lost but recent pipeline is active). I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the 1.5-period empirical lead time). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=9 to reflect the new high-demand regime (use last 9 periods to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=9 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These choices raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while basing safety stock on recent variability and empirically observed lead time, mitigating stockouts from delayed/lost earlier shipments.

Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead times mostly 1\u20132 periods. I choose L='calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 period reality). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to focus the forecast on the high-demand regime reflected in the last 9 concluded demands. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=9 to estimate volatility from the same recent high-demand window. These choices bias orders toward meeting the new high demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using observed lead time and recent variability; they also avoid overreacting to the long-ago low-demand samples. I flag that in-transit=291 likely includes multiple outstanding shipments (some overdue historically), so using recent demand and observed lead times helps prevent stockouts while controlling holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand is in a sustained higher regime: last 5 weekly demands = [161,108,77,116,137], avg=119.8 which is far above the historical 4.8 baseline. Pipeline is large (in-transit=386, on-hand=0) from prior orders; earlier missing arrivals occurred but recent concludes show arrivals with observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,1] (avg ~1.4). To reflect the empirically shorter lead time and the elevated recent demand, set L using calculated recent experience (so backend uses observed-average lead time), and set demand and volatility using the most recent 5 weeks to capture current regime and volatility. These choices let the OR engine compute a base-stock targeted to the current high-demand regime while accounting for the empirically observed shorter lead time and the present pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13): recent demand is much higher than initial historical samples (confirmed regime shift around Period 10). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,1,2} \u2192 avg 1.5. Many past orders experienced delayed/no arrival before conclusion windows; using observed lead-time history avoids trusting promised L=2 alone. I set L by calculating the average of all observed lead times to reflect realized behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) covering the most recent six concluded demand periods (Periods 8\u201313) to capture the sustained high-demand regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N window to reflect current volatility. These choices make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the new, higher demand while L captures the shorter observed lead time, helping the OR backend size base stock to meet service while limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent demand has shifted sharply higher (sustained high weekly demand across recent periods) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=336 units (pipeline large but arrivals are observed with variable lead times). Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2,1,2,1,1,2,2 (avg \u22481.57), so I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed arrives (method=calculate). To capture the new high-demand regime and avoid dilution from early low pre-season samples, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (uses last 9 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This focuses provisioning on the confirmed high-demand regime while the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost with its base-stock and cap calculations.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Demand has been in a higher regime since early periods (sustained high weekly sales since Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=413 (large pipeline but several recent concludes showed arrivals=0 for some orders \u2192 possible variable lead time/lost shipments). Observed lead times from concluded arrivals = [2,1,2,1,2,2]; I use recent_N for L (N=6) to capture the recent average lead time (~1.67) rather than blindly trusting promised=2. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to base mu_hat on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (captures increased mean over the last ~12 periods). Sigma_hat set to recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These settings steer the OR engine to a base-stock appropriate for the new high-demand regime while using an empirically estimated lead time to avoid under- or over-ordering given observed delivery variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time updated: observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,2], average \u22481.67 periods (Periods with concluded arrivals: P4, P6, P8x2, P10, P13, P14) \u2014 confirms variable but shorter-than-promised average lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime (large, multi-period spike vs. historical mean) and variable but shorter observed lead times (avg \u22481.67). On-hand=0, in-transit=420 \u2014 sizable pipeline that will cover several upcoming periods. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the confirmed shorter/variable lead time vs. promised=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to base mu_hat on the most recent high-demand regime (captures the new demand level while smoothing short noise). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders to match the new higher demand while relying on the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering; using recent samples reduces the influence of old, low-demand data and aligns safety stock to recent variance.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 4 (much larger than the 5-sample historical baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=374 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times show variability but an average shorter than promised; use backend's calculation to capture observed lead-time distribution. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent history (last 9 periods) so the base-stock accounts for elevated mean and volatility while the backend cap limits extreme orders. This balances high service (profit/holding => q\u22480.95) with holding cost and addresses past delayed/lost shipments by relying on observed lead-time calc rather than the promised value.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times are variable but shorter than promised (avg ~1.67); use backend 'calculate' to let it average observed lead times. Set demand forecast using recent data to capture the sustained high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=15 (captures Periods 4\u201318 regime). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=15 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure base_stock and caps are computed from current high-demand regime and observed lead-time behavior, preventing understock given large in-transit but high ongoing demand.

Use 'calculate' for L so backend averages observed lead times from concluded messages (captures variable/shorter LT). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L), letting the OR engine compute base-stock and cap given the inferred L. This balances higher service need (observed demand surge) against holding cost.

Observed concluded lead times show variability but shorter-than-promised on average; use calculated average lead time to let backend account for empirical arrivals. Use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base demand estimate on the confirmed high-demand regime (N=9 matches the recent high-demand window referenced in carry-over). These choices bias orders toward meeting elevated demand while relying on existing large pipeline to limit incremental ordering and holding cost exposure.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent demand has been persistently high (~100+ units per period since Period 5) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=440. Historical concluded lead-times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (variable but centered below promised 2). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average all observed lead times (captures variable 1-2 behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the sustained high-demand regime (regime length \u224818 periods: Periods 4\u201321) so the forecast reflects current elevated demand rather than small early-sample values. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=18 to estimate volatility from the same regime. These choices prioritize service (meet high, persistent demand) while using observed lead-time behavior to avoid overstocking for a 2-period promise that empirically varies.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand remains at a much higher regime (weekly demand often ~100+ vs historical mean ~4.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=415 (large pipeline but arrivals have variable lead times historically). Observed concluded lead times show variability around ~1.5 periods (some 1, some 2); promised =2. To capture shorter recent lead-time behavior I set L to be calculated from observed arrivals. For demand I use a recent-window estimate to reflect sustained high demand (avoid diluting with tiny historical samples). I choose recent_N (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent 12 demand observations, which balances service (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) against holding cost and accounts for the new high-demand regime and variable lead time.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 4 (recent weekly demand ~100+); on-hand=0, in-transit=386 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures variable but < promised). For demand I use recent_N (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the sustained high-demand regime (last 12 samples capture current intensity while avoiding outdated low historical samples). This balances service (meeting high demand) while the large pipeline limits additional ordering aggressiveness.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=425. Recent demand has been much higher than historical five-sample mean (sustained ~100-160 per period across many recent periods). Observed concluded lead_times show variability but a shorter average (~1.67) from the last 6 concluded arrivals. I set L to recent_N (N=6) to reflect the empirically observed shorter lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=9 to base the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (capture elevated mean and volatility from the last 9 demand observations). These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts while using recent volatility to limit excessive safety stock and holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05): demand has been persistently high since Period 4 (many weeks of 80\u2013160 weekly demand vs historical ~5). Pipeline=425, on-hand=0 (large in-transit stock). Observed concluded lead times fluctuate 1\u20132 with average \u22481.67; this supports using an empirically estimated lead time. To capture the sustained high-demand regime, I use recent_N=20 for demand mean and volatility (caps at 20 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent high-demand behavior and reduce influence of the old low-demand samples. L uses calculate to let the backend average observed lead times from concluded arrivals. These settings balance service (high mean \u2192 higher base stock) against holding cost by using recent data and backend caps.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been much higher than historical five-sample levels (sustained high weekly demand ~80\u2013160 over many periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=413 \u2014 substantial pipeline but several past orders showed variable lead times (including a 3-period outlier at P26 conclude). I choose L="calculate" to let the backend average all observed concluded lead times (captures variable/shorter-than-promised behavior). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to base mu_hat on the latest 20 weeks where the high-demand regime is established. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=20) to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the backend compute lead-time from observed arrivals and cap orders to avoid excessive single-period replenishment given the large in-transit inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime vs historical low mean (carry-over confirmed). On-hand=0, in-transit=413 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times produce a shorter/variable actual lead time \u2014 use calculated average from concluded arrivals to reflect that. Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast/volatility on the most recent nine demand periods (captures the sustained high-demand regime) while letting the OR backend scale by (1+L). This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given a large in-transit position and shorter observed lead times.

Recent demand is elevated and stable (~90\u2013130/week in last 9 periods). Set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times from concluded arrivals (captures variable but shorter-than-promised LT). Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime (last 9 periods), so base-stock targets replenishment to cover the current high-demand level while avoiding excess held inventory given holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=413. Recent demand has been persistently high (many weeks 80\u2013162) versus the original small-sample historical series. Observed lead times have varied but recent carry-over evidence shows average ~1.67 (shorter than promised 2). To let the OR engine adapt to observed variability I set L using the observed lead-time average (backend 'calculate') so pipeline coverage reflects realized arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the sustained high-demand regime from the most recent samples (reduces weight of the original five low samples). I mirror this for sigma_hat (recent_N, N=9) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the high-demand regime while using observed lead-time info to avoid over/under-ordering given the large in-transit volume (413 units) already en route.

Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand regime remains high (recent weekly demands ~100\u2013130); on-hand=0, in-transit=413 (some prior shipments delayed/lost). Use lead-time estimate from observed arrivals (shorter-than-promised average) so backend sizes replenishment appropriately: L set to calculate (average of observed lead times). For demand, use recent_N with N=9 (last 9 demand samples reflect the sustained high-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect current elevated mean and volatility and avoid chronic stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind.

On-hand=0, in-transit=413 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are delayed (variable lead times historically). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (captures variable but shorter-than-promised LT).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Demand has been persistently high for many periods (recent weekly demands ~82\u2013162); on-hand=0, in-transit=413 but no arrivals observed in the last many conclude messages despite promised L=2 \u2192 suggests overdue/lost shipments. Use observed lead-time history to set L (backend will average observed lead times). For demand forecast use recent window to capture the new high-demand regime (recent 9 weeks) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean and volatility. This balances service (capture high demand) versus holding cost by using a recent-sample forecast rather than the long-run low historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Outstanding in-transit = 413 units appear overdue: no arrivals observed in conclude messages for Periods 24\u201332 (9 consecutive periods with arrivals=0) despite promised lead_time=2 \u2192 evidence of prolonged shipment delays or lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30): on-hand=0, in-transit=413 (many overdue), recent demand has been persistently high since Period 4. Historical concluded lead-times show variable but shorter-than-promised (several 1\u20132 period observations). To reflect observed lead-time behavior while letting the backend compute a robust average from concluded arrivals, set L=calculate. Demand regime is clearly higher and sustained since Period 4 \u2192 use recent_N for mu_hat (N=20) to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent regime; match sigma_hat to recent variability with recent_N (N=20). These choices keep the backend\u2019s base-stock responsive to the new high-demand regime while letting lead-time inference use observed arrival data; they also avoid overcommitting to presumed non-concluded shipments (the overdue in-transit may be lost).

On-hand=0, in-transit=413 which appear overdue (no concludes for many periods) \u2014 treat in-transit as unreliable. Use observed lead-time history rather than promised. Set L via calculate to let backend average observed lead times.

These choices prioritize matching inventory to the new high-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances $19 profit vs $1 holding cost; using recent samples limits understock risk from the large, likely-lost pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand regime is the elevated regime confirmed earlier (sustained high weekly demand since Periods ~4\u201335). On-hand=0, in-transit=413 (many overdue arrivals since Period 24\u201332); treat pipeline cautiously but do not yet declare new lead-time regime. Set L via calculate to let backend use observed arrivals history (captures variable lead times ~1.6\u20131.7). Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent 9 demand observations (Periods 27\u201335) reflecting the current high-demand regime and limiting influence of the original low-demand samples. This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302 for high demand) against holding cost while allowing the OR engine cap to limit excessive ordering given uncertain/possibly lost in-transit stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): recent demand remains high (last 5 periods avg \u2248103.8/week) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=413 units have shown no concludes for many periods (Periods 24\u201336 arrivals=0) suggesting prolonged delays or lost shipments. To protect service level given possible lost/very-delayed pipeline, I set lead time explicitly longer so the backend raises safety stock. I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 weeks) to capture the new high-demand regime and match sigma to recent volatility (N=5). These choices bias orders upward to cover (L+1) future periods of elevated demand while accepting higher holding cost to avoid stockouts under uncertain/overdue pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=0, in-transit=557 with prolonged missing arrivals since Periods 24\u201336; demand has shifted to a higher regime (recent weekly demands ~80\u2013136). Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed concluded lead times (evidence of variable but shorter-than-promised lead time). For demand, use recent_N N=10 to focus mu_hat on the last ~10 high-demand samples and reduce influence of the low historical baseline. For sigma_hat use recent_N N=10 to capture recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize meeting elevated recent demand while reflecting observed lead-time variability and avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=92, in-transit=413 (many overdue/unconfirmed arrivals in prior conclude messages). Historical demand shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 10; observed concluded lead_times are variable but average shorter than promised. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures realized, variable LT rather than blind promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to weight the (1+L) forecast toward the sustained high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect current volatility in that same recent regime. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated demand revealed since Period 10 while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid over/under-ordering given missing/late shipments.

Observed concluded lead times are variable but shorter-than-promised on average; use backend-calculated average to capture that variability. To prioritize service (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 high target service level) while reflecting the recent high-demand regime, set L to 'calculate' (use observed lead times), use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecasts on the latest 20 demand samples and recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): on-hand=31, in-transit=413 (many appear overdue; long run history shows variable actual lead times ~1.67 and sustained high demand since Period 4). I set L explicit=1.67 to reflect the shorter-than-promised observed lead time (reduces pipeline safety but matches concluded arrivals). Demand has been in a sustained high regime (many periods of 70\u2013160); I use recent_N with N=20 to let the backend compute mu_hat over the most recent 20 demand samples (captures current elevated mean) and sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align base-stock upward for high demand while using a realistic shorter lead time to avoid over-ordering against potentially lost in-transit stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=9, in-transit=413 (many appear overdue/lost per history). Observed concluded lead_times show variable but shorter-than-promised behavior (recent observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,2], avg \u22481.67) so I use recent observed lead times to set L. Recent demand has declined from the earlier spike; using the most recent 8 demand samples (Periods 34\u201341: 119,84,79,74,52,41,20,22) captures the current lower-winter demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat as recent_N (N=8) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std \u2014 this scales safety stock to the inferred lead time while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost is low ($1) but profit is high ($19), so we bias toward service but avoid overstocking from the large overdue in-transit.

Historical concluded lead times are variable (mixture of 1\u20133; recent average \u22481.6\u20131.7). Demand history contains earlier high spikes but recent weeks show moderate weekly demand. To let the OR engine use observed lead-time behavior while keeping demand/volatility estimates grounded in all available samples, I choose: L by calculate (backend will average observed lead times); mu_hat default (backend uses (1+L)*mean of all samples); sigma_hat default (backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). This balances service level given variable/shorter observed lead times while avoiding overreacting to transient spikes; flags of overdue in-transit will be carried forward separately.

Historical small-sample base (Jan samples avg=4.8) is no longer representative \u2014 demand regime shifted upward earlier (confirmed in carry-over). Observed lead times have varied but recent concluded arrivals imply shorter-than-promised L; allow backend to compute empirical average from observed arrivals. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the sustained high-demand regime (use most recent 20 demand samples to capture current mean/volatility across the review+lead horizon). This increases base stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current demand variability, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=413 but those shipments appear overdue (no conclude arrivals for many periods) and likely lost or delayed; use concluded arrivals history to infer lead time. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of all observed lead times (observed arrivals imply avg \u22481.64), which reflects the realized variability shorter than the promised 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent regime (captures the recent moderated demand vs earlier spikes). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=6) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering against the large overdue pipeline while preserving service given current demand levels and the observed lead-time behavior.

Historical concluded lead times imply an average shorter-than-promised lead time (~1.6\u20131.7). I choose L=calculate to let backend use the observed average lead time from concluded arrivals. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime (most recent 9 periods, Periods 37\u201345) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 so the OR engine targets supply for the current demand level and measured volatility, reducing excess holding given the large overdue pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=413 (long-overdue; many periods with no conclude arrivals \u2192 likely lost/delayed shipments). Recent demand has declined in December (last 4 concluded demands: 33,35,27,31 \u2192 avg\u224831.5) so I bias the forecast to the most recent low-demand regime and avoid inflating orders against possibly lost pipeline. Set L by calculating observed lead times (use backend's average of concluded lead times) so OR learns from historic arrival behavior. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=4) to reflect the current December demand level and volatility, reducing stock risk given holding cost and uncertain in-transit. This balances service level (cover near-term demand) against holding cost and the risk of ordering into potentially lost pipeline.
