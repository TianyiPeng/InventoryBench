Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (5 weeks) average ~51.2 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals or overdue shipments visible. No evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime change (only 5 consistent samples). Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service vs holding given symmetric profit and holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=63 (ordered P1) and Period1 conclude shows ordered=63 arrived=0 \u2192 shipment has not yet concluded but single missed arrival is insufficient to confirm a lead-time change or lost order. Historical weekly demand samples mean=51.2; promised lead time=2. To avoid overreacting to a single delayed arrival, use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand stats so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This preserves service level from historical demand while avoiding added holding cost from prematurely inflating forecasts given no sustained demand or lead-time shift evidence.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical sample mean = 51.2 units/week (5 samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=131. Promised lead time=2 but orders placed in P1/P2 have not yet concluded (arrived=0 in P1/P2 concludes) \u2014 insufficient evidence to change lead-time (need \u22653 periods of delayed arrivals). Pipeline (131) < (1+L)*mean \u2248 153.6 so risk of shortfall; use default demand aggregation so backend uses full sample mean and promised L to compute base-stock and the capped order. Chosen methods are conservative: keep L as promised, let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full sample to avoid overfitting to short history or transient delays while the shipment status clarifies in future periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-3): 66, 88, 70 (mean=74.67). On-hand=0, in-transit=176; no concluded arrivals yet for Periods 1-3, so cannot confirm a lead-time change. Use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting. Set L=default (promised=2). For demand, use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current higher short-term demand: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last3)=3\xd774.67 \u2248224. sigma_hat use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting near-term demand while limiting exposure to holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $68.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=156. One concluded arrival shows an actual lead time of 2 (order on P2 arrived P4); earlier P1/P3 orders have not concluded and may be lost/delayed. Historical weekly sample mean=51.2 (Jan samples) but recent observed demand (Periods 1-4) averages 75.25, indicating a higher current demand regime. To capture the confirmed lead-time evidence use calculate for L (backend will average observed lead times). To reflect the recent higher demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (uses last 4 observed demands: 66,88,70,77) so the OR engine reorders to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while accounting for recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given higher recent demand) against holding cost by using a short recent window rather than the older lower-mean samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: historical mean (2019-01 samples) = 51.2 vs recent Periods 1-4 mean = 75.25 (+46.9%), sustained over 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand elevated vs historical: recent 5-period mean = 73 (periods 1-5) vs historical mean 51.2; sustained higher demand evidenced in periods 1-5. On-hand=0, in-transit=226; one concluded arrival shows actual observed lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (supports promised 2). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead demand forecast. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders up to cover the confirmed higher demand while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering given in-transit units and possible lost shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=156. Observed arrivals in conclude messages show variable lead times (observed W=2 for order on P2->arrived P4; W=1 for order on P5->arrived P6), suggesting actual lead time has been inconsistent vs promised=2. Demand has shifted upward versus historical Jan samples (recent periods show sustained higher weekly demand around 64\u201388). I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures recent variability objectively). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (use the last 6 demand samples from Periods 1\u20136) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher regime and recent volatility. This balances higher service needs (higher mu_hat) while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from recent variability; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure but we keep forecasts responsive to the new regime.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has been well above historical Jan samples (sustained higher regime noted earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=220 \u2014 there are multiple outstanding shipments (some arrivals observed with lead times 2 and 1, others delayed), so infer lead time from observed arrivals rather than using promised blindly. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect recent variability. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (last 5 demand observations), so the OR backend targets a higher base-stock and accounts for short-term variability while limiting excess inventory given holding cost equals profit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=164. Recent concluded lead times: P4 showed 2, P6 and P8 showed 1 \u2014 recent mode is 1. Demand has been in a higher regime since early periods (carry-over already recorded). I set L based on the most recent observed lead times average to reflect the shorter recent deliveries. For demand I use a recent_N window (last 4 concluded demands P5\u2013P8) to capture the elevated regime; sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias ordering toward meeting the higher short-term demand while keeping holding risk limited given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has been higher than historical 2019-Jan baseline (sustained uplift across periods), and on-hand=0 with in-transit=236 (multiple outstanding orders; some arrivals observed with lead_times 2,1,1). I set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures observed 2,1,1 \u2192 ~1.33). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across all available post-start periods; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the elevated recent mean while letting the OR engine balance service vs holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent realized demands (Periods 1-10) show elevated demand versus historical 2019-Jan samples; carry-over previously recorded a sustained regime shift. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2,1} -> average ~1.4, so I use the calculated average rather than the promised L=2. On-hand=43 and in-transit=156 provide substantial pipeline cover; using recent_N (last 5 demands: P6-P10 = 75,93,82,56,37) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the current demand regime while limiting sensitivity to a single low week. These parameters balance service (higher mu_hat from recent elevated demand) against holding cost given already-large in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=163. Historical concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P8:1, P10(from P8):2, P10(from P9):1} => average ~1.4. Demand has shown a sustained higher regime vs Jan samples (recent elevated mean over several periods). To capture shorter realized lead-time while remaining conservative, set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate). For demand level, use a recent-window mean to reflect the sustained higher regime (recent_N N=4 covers the detected changepoint window) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 4 samples). Similarly use recent_N N=4 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock that raises target inventory to meet elevated demand while using observed shorter lead-time to avoid over-pipeline; using recent_N for sigma keeps safety stock responsive to current variability. No overdue shipments require explicit action beyond using observed lead-time inferences.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has shifted up vs historical (recent 4-period mean ~75.25 vs historical 51.2). Pipeline = 213, on-hand = 0; several prior orders arrived with mixed lead times (observed lead times: 2,1,1,2,1). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time (~1.4) from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 4 demand samples). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices steer the OR engine to raise base stock for the new regime while using observed lead-time evidence rather than the promised value.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=219 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent demand but arrivals have shown inconsistent lead times (observed lead times: 2,1,1,2,1,2 => avg 1.5). Historical demand shifted up around Period 5 and has stayed higher; use recent regime to set demand forecast. Set L using calculate (avg observed lead time) to let OR backend account for realized lead-time ~1.5. Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5 (regime length 9 periods), so forecasts and safety stock are driven by recent higher mean and volatility while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=186 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times show variability but average >1 (observed W series: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2 \u2192 mean \u22481.57) so I let backend compute the empirical average (method: calculate). Demand shifted upward starting around Period 5 and has remained elevated (recent weeks show high demands: e.g. Periods 11-14 = 108,100,91,121). To capture the recent higher regime I use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 7 demand samples; this balances service (higher recent demand) against holding costs while the backend's cap prevents over-ordering given pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 and has remained elevated; use recent demand (last 11 weeks since the changepoint) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the higher demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=255 (large pipeline) \u2014 parameters aim to size orders to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=260. History shows variable actual lead times (observed: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2 \u2192 avg \u22481.57) and a sustained demand increase since mid-periods (high demands in Periods 11\u201316). I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the observed average lead time rather than the promised 2 (captures mixed 1\u20132 leads). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (reduces bias from earlier low-demand January samples). Sigma uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new higher-demand regime while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg demand Periods 11\u201316 = 114.33 vs prior recent avg ~75.25 (+52%), sustained over 6 periods

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=219. Recent demand regime elevated since Period 11 (avg Periods 11\u201316 = 114.33), so forecast should use recent high-demand regime. Observed concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods with a recent average ~1.67; to capture this variability use recent lead-time estimate. Set L using recent_N to reflect recent observed lead times. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N equal to the detected elevated-demand regime length (6 periods, Periods 11\u201316) so (1+L)*mean reflects the new higher demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given confirmed higher demand, while using recent volatility and lead-time estimate to limit overstock given holding cost parity with profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time variability confirmed: recent 6 observed lead times = [2,1,2,2,1,2], avg = 1.67 (mix of 1 and 2 periods); treat lead time as variable rather than fixed promised 2.

Lead times have been variable (mix of 1 and 2); use recent observations. Set L using recent 6 observed lead times to capture variability.

Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 11 (avg Periods 11\u201316 = 114.33 vs prior ~75) \u2014 treat recent higher mean as persistent. Lead times have varied recently (observed last 6 = [2,1,2,2,1,2], avg\u22481.67) so use a recent-average lead time. To align the OR backend with the confirmed higher-demand regime while accounting for variable lead time and large pipeline, I set L based on the last 6 observed lead times (recent_N N=6). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use the recent-demand regime (last 11 periods since the changepoint at Period 11) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most-relevant samples. This balances service (higher base stock) against holding cost while recognizing substantial in-transit inventory.

Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 11; observed lead times vary (mix of 1\u20132 periods). Current inventory: on-hand=26, in-transit=228 (pipeline=254). Because lead time is heterogeneous, use recent observed lead-time average (short window) to capture variability. For demand I focus on the most recent 6 periods to reflect the current high-demand regime and recent volatility; same window used for sigma to feed OR backend a responsive base-stock and realistic cap. These choices balance service (protect against stockouts in a higher-demand regime) vs holding cost by limiting horizon to recent data rather than all historical samples.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows elevated demand regime since Period 11 (sustained higher demand) and variable lead times (mix of 1\u20132 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=258 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals will be observed with delay. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to capture the 1\u20132 period variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR backend computes demand over the review+lead horizon using all samples, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=258. Recent observed lead times are mixed (recent 6 avg \u22481.67), and demand has shown multiple regime shifts; recent demand (Periods 19\u201325) averages ~83.9. To reflect variable lead time use recent_N on last 6 observed lead times. To capture the most recent demand level and volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 7 demand samples (Periods 19\u201325). This keeps orders responsive to the currently elevated but variable demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate ordering risk.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand is volatile: after prior high regime (Periods 11\u201316 avg ~114), the last 6 demands (Periods 21\u201326 = 79,52,68,39,74,44) average ~59.3, so I favor a recent-window forecast. On-hand=0, in-transit=258 (large pipeline) so use recent lead-time estimate rather than promised 2. Set L by averaging the last 6 observed lead times (mix of 1 and 2, avg ~1.67). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 demand samples to capture current downward shift while preserving responsiveness to volatility; this balances service (given substantial in-transit stock) versus holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=258. Historical lead times show variability (mix of 1 and 2); recent 6 observed lead times avg ~1.67 so I use recent_N to capture that. Recent demand (Periods 22\u201327 = 52,68,39,74,44,65; mean=57) is materially below the earlier high regime, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods to reflect the current lower regime and recent volatility. Using recent_N for L, mu_hat, sigma_hat lets the OR engine size orders for the current demand level while accounting for the observed lead-time variability and avoids overstock given holding cost parity with profit. Pipeline (258) already covers multiple review+lead periods, so this conservative recent-based forecast prevents additional excess ordering if shipments are delayed or lost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=258 (large pipeline but no arrivals observed in Periods 25-28 conclude messages). Historical lead times show variability (mix of 1 and 2); recent observed lead times = [2,1,2,2,1,2] (avg~1.67). Recent demand has cooled from earlier spikes; last 6 concluded demands (Periods 23-28) = [68,39,74,44,65,64], mean ~59. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5 \u2192 z\u22480), use recent data for both lead time and demand to reflect current regime and pipeline uncertainty. Therefore: infer lead time from the last 6 observed leads, and forecast demand and volatility from the most recent 6 demand samples. This treats the variable lead-time behavior explicitly and avoids overstocking from older high-demand regimes while accounting for current pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has fallen back toward pre-spike levels: last 6 demands (Periods 24\u201329) average ~55 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=258 (ample pipeline). Lead time history shows mixed 1\u20132 periods; use recent average to capture variability. I set L using recent_N to reflect measured lead-time mix. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=6 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures post-spike lower mean). This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit inventory while matching short-term demand and variable lead time.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times (11 observations) average \u22481.55 periods with mix of 1 and 2; use calculated average to capture variability. Demand has shifted upward vs initial samples and shows variability; no new sustained regime detected since prior carry-overs. Use calculate for L to reflect observed lead-time mix; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting OR engine balance service vs holding cost given estimated L.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=258 (large pipeline). Historical demand shows a recent sustained downshift since Period 25. Lead times have been variable (mix of 1 and 2). To reflect variable LT use recent_N for L (short window of observed Ls). For demand and volatility use recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (Periods 25\u201331) so the OR engine targets a lower base-stock and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5). These choices balance service vs holding given substantial in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: avg Periods 25\u201331 = 51.0 vs prior avg Periods 11\u201316 = 114.33 (\u221255%), sustained over 7 periods

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been in the lower regime (Periods 25\u201331 avg = 51.0); on-hand = 0, in-transit = 258 (large pipeline but recent concludes show no new arrivals arriving in Periods 25\u201332). Observed lead times have varied (mix of 1 and 2); to reflect recent variability I use recent_N for L with N=6 (captures most recent observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to align mu_hat and sigma_hat to the confirmed lower-demand regime (Periods 25\u201331 length=7). These choices bias ordering down to avoid excess holding cost while respecting variable lead time and the large existing pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since Period 25 (recent 9-period avg \u224853.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=258 (large pipeline) \u2014 no urgent top-up needed but must account for variable lead times previously observed. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (mix of 1\u20132 periods, avg ~1.67). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (periods 25\u201333 avg \u224853.7) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=9 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices bias orders toward the current lower-demand regime while the calculated lead time captures the 1\u20132 period variability, balancing service vs holding costs given the large in-transit stock.

I set L=calculate to let backend use the observed average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 25\u201334). Sigma uses recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstating demand (lowers holding cost) while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit stock.

I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures 1\u20132 mix). For demand I use recent_N (N=11) to capture the lower post-Period-25 regime (Periods 25\u201335) rather than older high-demand periods; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N window to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce forecast bias from earlier high-demand regime while letting the OR engine size orders for the current lower-demand regime and the empirically observed lead-time variability.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 25 (many zero-order periods and small weekly demand: recent samples P25\u2013P36 show lower means vs earlier spikes). Lead time has shown variability (mix of 1 and 2 periods in prior observations). On-hand=0, in-transit=258 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent low demand, so avoid inflating demand forecast. I set L using recent observed lead times to capture variability; I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window covering the current low-demand regime (12 most recent demand samples) so the backend base-stock targets a low-service level appropriate to equal profit and holding cost. These choices reduce risk of excess holding while acknowledging lead-time volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 25 (avg \u2248 51 for P25\u201331 then falling further through P37); on-hand=0, in-transit=258 (many shipments overdue/no recent arrivals). Observed lead times historically vary 1\u20132 periods; no new concluded arrivals to change that view. To reflect variable lead time use recent_N on lead-time observations (stable evidence from prior periods). For demand, use recent_N covering the current low-demand regime (most recent 13 periods P25\u2013P37) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower demand and reduce overstock risk given high in-transit. These parameters bias orders downward to avoid excess holding cost while acknowledging variable 1\u20132 period lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been much lower since Period 25; on-hand=0 but large in-transit=258 (covers several weeks). Observed lead times vary (mixture of 1 and 2); use recent observed lead times. To reflect the latest low-demand regime and lead-time mix, set L based on the last 6 observed lead times and forecast demand/volatility from the last 6 demand samples. This keeps orders responsive to the recent low-demand regime while accounting for pipeline stock to avoid over-ordering.

Lead time has shown variability (mix of 1\u20132); use a recent_N average of recent observed lead times to reflect that variability.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has fallen sharply since the Period 32 regime shift: Periods 32\u201340 demand series = [60,66,16,18,13,10,9,11,12], recent mean \u2248 23.9 units/week. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 258 \u2014 ample pipeline stock vs current low demand, but promised lead time = 2 has shown variability historically (recent observed LT mix ~1\u20132). To avoid overstock given holding cost = profit, I rely on recent-demand estimates and short effective lead-time: set L based on recent observed lead-time mix (use recent_N=6). For demand forecast, use recent_N on the most recent low-demand regime (N=9 covering Periods 32\u201340) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For sigma_hat use recent_N with same recent window (N=9) to capture current low volatility. These choices reduce ordering compared with long-run averages, preventing excess ending inventory while still covering (1+L) periods of expected demand and accounting for lead-time variability.

Observed concluded lead times show variability (mix of 1 and 2 periods); use calculated average lead time to reflect variability. Use recent_N (N=17 = length of the low-demand regime, Periods 25\u201341) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the current low regime and avoids overstocking given holding cost = profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=258. Historical concludes show lead times varying between 1\u20132 periods (recent observed avg ~1.67). Demand has fallen into a sustained low regime since Period 33 (recent 10 periods demand avg \u2248 18), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current low-demand regime. Set L explicitly to 1.67 to reflect observed mixed 1\u20132 period deliveries; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent stable low-demand regime. This reduces over-ordering versus using older high-demand data while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the current pipeline of 258 units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time history shows mixed 1\u20132 periods; use calculated average lead time to let backend infer from observed concludes. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=11 to capture the current low-demand regime (N chosen as the recent regime length = 11). This emphasizes lower target stocking to avoid holding cost while maintaining service for the sustained low-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=258. Recent concluded history shows a sustained low-demand regime since late Sep (Periods 34\u201344) after earlier regime shifts; lead times historically vary between 1\u20132 periods. To avoid overstocking given high pipeline and low recent demand, use a lead-time estimate aggregated from observed lead-time history and downweight long-run demand by using recent samples (capture current low regime). Chosen methods: L='calculate' to reflect observed mix of 1\u20132 period lead times; mu_hat='recent_N' with N=12 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 12 demand samples (captures current low-demand regime and avoids inflating orders from older high-demand periods); sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=12 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This reduces target base-stock and caps orders given large in-transit inventory, balancing service vs holding cost.

Demand has been in a low regime for many weeks (recent 10 periods avg ~13.2 units/week), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the current low-demand regime and lower volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 25 with on-hand=0 and large in-transit=258. Lead times have been variable (mix of 1 and 2 periods) in concluded arrivals. To respect observed variability I choose recent_N for lead time (use recent 6 observed lead times). For demand I anchor to the recent low-demand regime (Periods 25\u201346, long sustained run) and use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current regime mean across the review+lead period. Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent variability. These choices reduce over-ordering versus using older high-demand data while acknowledging lead-time variability.
