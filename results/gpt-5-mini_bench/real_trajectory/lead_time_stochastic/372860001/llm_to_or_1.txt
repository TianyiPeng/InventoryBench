Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time change or demand regime shift. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates based on all historical samples; this gives the OR engine (1+L)-scaled mean/volatility and avoids overfitting to nonexistent short-run signals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=310 (ordered P1) but no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 insufficient evidence to change promised lead time. Historical weekly demand mean \u2248266.4 (5 samples). Use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility formulas so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters conservative while awaiting concluded arrivals; if the P1 order never concludes in future periods, switch to explicit/recent_N lead-time handling then.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand mean = 266.4 (samples: 231,255,302,272,272). On-hand=0, in-transit=621 (orders from P1/P2 not yet observed as arrived in concluded messages). Promised lead time=2 and there is no concluded arrival showing actual lead time different, so use default promised L to avoid premature adjustments. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std (captures demand across review+lead period). This keeps policy aligned with historical demand while letting backend handle service-level tradeoff; monitor upcoming conclude for any lost/delayed shipments and adjust if arrivals fail to materialize.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=929 (orders: P1=310, P2=311, P3=308) and no arrivals reported in Periods 1-3 conclude. Promised L=2 but three consecutive orders have not arrived by their promised conclude, indicating lead time has stretched. I choose L explicit=3 to reflect demonstrated delay (conservative next-step). Demand history (five weekly samples mean=266.4) used with default demand scaling so mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7mean to cover review+lead period under the longer lead. Sigma_hat left as default to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings bias orders upward to cover the extended pipeline while the OR backend applies its service-level cap to limit excess stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed \u22653 periods: orders placed P1(310), P2(311), P3(308) all unarrived by their promised conclude (3 consecutive missed arrivals).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=972 (orders: P1=310, P2=311, P3=308, P4=43?). History: P2 arrival observed (arrived=311, lead_time=2). P1 and P3 remain unarrived beyond promised lead time -> treat as potential lost shipments. Use calculated lead time from observed concludes (average observed lead_time=2) so L="calculate". Demand has shifted vs. older Jan samples; use most recent 4 demand observations (Periods 1-4: 287,548,399,338) to capture current regime for mean and volatility. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 4 samples. This balances service (higher short-term mean) against holding cost and accounts for likely lost units by not inflating L.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed P1 (310 units, Period 1) and P3 (308 units, Period 3) remain unarrived beyond promised lead time while P2 (311) arrived with lead_time=2 \u2014 evidence of partial shipment loss or irregular fulfillment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand elevated and volatile (Period1-5 demands: 287,548,399,338,252). On-hand=0, in-transit=1179 (some past orders unconfirmed/partially lost). Several early orders failed to conclude on time (P1,P3 missing) while P2 arrived with lead_time=2; risk of longer/irregular lead times persists so I use a conservative explicit lead time. Set L explicit=3 to cover potential delayed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher/volatile regime over the last 5 periods so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service level given shipment uncertainty while letting the OR backend cap orders via its cap rule to limit over-ordering.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent history shows irregular arrivals: some orders arrived with lead_time=2 (P2) and lead_time=1 (P5) while other orders remain unarrived beyond promised lead_time; pipeline=1253, on-hand=0. This indicates unstable/longer effective lead time and possible lost shipments. To protect service (given profit=holding so q=0.5) I set L explicitly to 3 to cover delayed arrivals. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat on default so the OR backend uses all historical weekly demand samples scaled by (1+L) to form base_stock and variability\u2014this balances higher safety stock for uncertain lead time while relying on historical demand rather than noisy recent arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (recent demands: P3=399, P4=338, P5=252, P6=329, P7=415). On-hand=0, in-transit=1268 but history shows irregular arrivals and some lost/late shipments (partial arrivals observed P4 and P6; other orders missed). Because actual lead times have exceeded the promised 2 in prior periods, I set L explicitly to 3 to be conservative and cover additional in-transit delay. To capture the recent higher demand regime, mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples P3\u2013P7) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on recent behavior. This increases safety stock to protect service level given shipment unreliability while balancing holding cost (profit=holding, so service vs inventory tradeoff handled by OR using these estimates).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand is elevated and volatile (period demands P1-P8 = 287,548,399,338,252,329,415,382). On-hand=0, in-transit=1091 (covers multiple outstanding orders but some earlier shipments were lost/delayed). Observed concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1] (orders from P2,P5,P6,P7); earlier P1 and P3 remain unarrived suggesting partial loss but not a sustained higher lead time. I set L by averaging the most recent 4 observed lead times to capture current variability without over-weighting older lost shipments (method: recent_N, N=4). For demand (mu_hat) I use the recent 8 periods to reflect the current higher-demand regime (method: recent_N, N=8). For sigma_hat I use recent 8 periods to capture current volatility (method: recent_N, N=8). These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock appropriate for the current elevated mean and variable lead time while avoiding overcommitment for possibly lost older orders.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=1107. History shows multiple late/missing arrivals (orders from P1,P3 remained missing while some orders arrived with lead_time 1\u20132), indicating actual lead time has been volatile and occasionally \u22653. To be conservative versus lost/delayed shipments, set explicit lead time=3 to cover longer fulfillment. Recent demand (Periods 4\u20139: 338,252,329,415,382,322) shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs the very early samples; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect current demand mean/volatility across the review+lead window. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve fill rates given delayed arrivals while sigma_hat recent_N captures observed variability so the OR backend caps orders appropriately.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent realized weekly demand has been well above the older 2019-Jan samples (recent 5-week mean ~351/wk). On-hand=0 but in-transit=1224 (large pipeline with some historical missing/late arrivals). Concluded history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20132) and evidence of lost/very-delayed shipments; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 to cover the risk of delayed arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 demand observations, capturing the recent higher-demand regime) so the backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and volatility over the most relevant regime\u2014this balances service level (avoid stockouts given recent high demand and uncertain arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent realized demand is consistently higher (~300-430/week) than the Jan baseline (231-272), so I treat this as a sustained higher-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=1405 (large pipeline), but history shows irregular/partial arrivals and some missing shipments (P1,P3 unarrived) so use observed lead-times only to estimate L. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,1} \u2192 avg=1.5; select calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent data (most recent 11 demand samples) to capture the higher regime: set mu_hat recent_N N=11. For volatility use recent_N N=11 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices balance higher service level to meet elevated demand while relying on pipeline to avoid overordering given missing-shipment risk.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=1405; history shows variable actual lead times (observed concluded lead_times = {2,1,2,1,2,1} -> avg 1.5) and a sustained higher demand regime since Period 2 onward (recent periods much larger than the 2019-Jan seed samples). To reflect the observed actual lead-time evidence I let L be calculated from observed lead times. For demand I use a recent-window estimate to capture the higher recent demand: recent_N with N=6 (uses the last 6 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds base_stock for the current (1+L) review+lead period while using recent volatility. This balances service (capturing elevated recent demand) against holding cost given profit=holding so the critical fractile is 0.5 and we avoid over-committing to long, uncertain in-transit inventory (some past shipments appear partially lost).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Demand history shows high and volatile weekly demand (samples: 231,255,302,272,272 and subsequent observed weekly demands up to 438). Lead times observed in concluded messages vary between 1 and 2 periods; some earlier orders appear lost or heavily delayed but recent concluded arrivals indicate most successful shipments have lead_time 1\u20132. On-hand is 0 with 1224 units in-transit (multiple outstanding orders, some previously delayed). To let the OR engine infer an empirical lead time from concluded arrivals, I request the backend calculate average observed lead time (method=calculate). For demand parameters use defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages the full historical demand while the backend's base-stock math and cap handle service/holding tradeoff. This approach is conservative given mixed delivery reliability: it avoids overfitting short recent spikes while allowing the OR engine to raise targets if calculated L increases from observed delays.

Historical concludes show irregular/extended lead times and several shipments missing beyond promised L=2 (some orders arrived with L=1 or 2, others remained unarrived) \u2014 evidence actual lead time is longer than promised. Set L explicit=3 to conservatively cover delayed/partially lost shipments. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) (captures baseline demand scaled for review+lead period). Use sigma_hat default so backend scales observed variability by sqrt(1+L). These choices raise target base-stock to protect service level given delayed arrivals while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-27. History shows irregular/ delayed arrivals and some lost shipments; pipeline=1331 but many prior orders missed promised timings. I set L explicit=3 to reflect sustained evidence of longer effective lead time (partial losses and >2 period delays). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (periods 11-15) which better reflects current demand levels; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These parameters raise target base stock to protect service given delayed/irregular arrivals while keeping recent demand-driven sizing to limit excess holding.

Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=1404. History shows inconsistent arrivals with multiple missed/late shipments and prior evidence that actual lead times have been >=3 for some orders and some partial losses. To be conservative vs. lost/delayed shipments, set lead time explicitly to 3. Demand has shifted upward vs the early-sample seed; use recent_N demand estimates to capture the current regime (stable recent high weekly demand). I choose recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, letting the engine size orders using up-to-date demand while capping order size to limit exposure to further lost shipments.

Historical concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1] \u2192 average ~1.56; earlier periods showed missing/lost shipments but recent pattern is mixed 1\u20132 periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=1241. History shows intermittent late/missing shipments (multiple orders unarrived beyond promised LT earlier) though several orders have observed LT=1\u20132 recently. To guard against further unseen delays/losses I explicitly inflate lead time to 3. Demand in recent periods has been consistently high (~294\u2013370); I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Thus: L explicit=3 to protect service, mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to base forecast on the most recent 6 demand observations, and sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias toward higher cover (reducing stockouts) while controlling excessive holding by using a recent-window demand estimate.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=1241 with history of irregular / partially lost shipments and several orders arriving with >=2-3 period delays. To be conservative vs. observed missed arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3. Demand recently has been stable in the 290\u2013340/week range (recent periods 11\u201319 show sustained weekly demand ~267\u2013438, most recent 9 periods average \u2248 ~320). Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime while limiting noise from older data. These choices increase on-hand coverage (1+L periods) to protect service level given unreliable arrivals while keeping variance estimate tied to recent demand to avoid excessive safety stock.

History shows irregular/partial arrivals: some orders never concluded and arrivals alternate between LT=1 and LT=2, implying unstable fulfillment and possible lost shipments. To be conservative against missing/late shipments I set lead time explicitly to 3. Demand has risen recently vs early-sample baseline; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher mean and volatility (weeks P16\u2013P20).

I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132-period behavior). For demand I use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)*mean of all historical samples (leveraging full sample set given limited recent stable regime evidence). Sigma uses 'default' to reflect historical volatility. This balances service level against holding cost while allowing the OR engine to handle pipeline uncertainty; I leave carry-over insights blank here as no new sustained pattern beyond existing notes is being added.

Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent weekly demand samples average ~322 with typical volatility; on-hand=0, in-transit=1316 (multiple past orders showed irregular/partial arrivals). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,2} (avg 1.6). To let the OR engine incorporate realized lead-time behavior I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will use average \u22481.6). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples scaled by 1+L) so the backend uses the full historical mean/volatility while accounting for the computed lead time; this balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) vs holding cost and leverages large in-transit stock while not overreacting to irregular lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=1316. History shows variable observed lead times (mostly 1\u20132 periods) and some earlier missing/partial arrivals; pipeline is large now. Use estimated lead time from observed history (calculate) so the OR engine adjusts for realized behavior vs promised. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, keeping forecasting stable given no clear recent demand regime shift.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows intermittent arrivals with some lost/late shipments earlier; on-hand=0, in-transit=1316. Observed concluded lead_times vary (1 and 2), so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand samples are sparse (historical sample list); use default forecasting (backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let OR engine apply standard safety stock given the inferred L. This balances service level (by increasing L if observations imply longer fulfillment) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times including a 3-period arrival (P23->P26) and several 2-period arrivals; recent average lead time is closer to 2. I use recent lead-time evidence (last 5 observed lead times) to set L to capture recent fulfillment variability. Demand has been lower than early-year samples; recent 5-week demand (P22\u2013P26 = 313,352,277,256,258) averages 291.2. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand regime and scale by (1+L) so the OR engine targets coverage across review+lead. I set sigma_hat with recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility; this helps the backend compute a base stock balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=1241. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods) and some missed/partial shipments; to be conservative about uncertain fulfillment I let the backend infer an empirical lead time from observed concludes. I choose L='calculate' so the backend averages observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so demand is computed from all historical samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (by using observed lead-time reality) against holding cost without overfitting to short-term spikes or missed arrivals.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weekly demand has been ~250-350 units with many stockouts; on-hand=0, in-transit=1241 (large pipeline, includes overdue/unconfirmed shipments). Historical conclude messages show variable lead times (observed arrivals with lead_time values: 2,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,3 \u2192 avg \u22481.78) and evidence of partial/missing shipments earlier. To capture the realized lead-time variability I set L=calculate (use average observed lead times). For demand I use default (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of all samples) and default sigma (backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std) so the OR engine leverages full history while the calculated L adjusts the review+lead coverage to observed fulfillment performance. This balances service (increase coverage if average lead >1) versus holding cost given high in-transit volume and past lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 Period 30. On-hand=0, in-transit=1241. Historical concluded arrivals show inconsistent lead times including multiple 3-period arrivals and several missed/late shipments; evidence supports treating actual lead time longer than promised to avoid stockouts when pipeline is unreliable. I set L explicitly to 3 to capture the observed >=3-period deliveries and partial shipment losses. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=1277. History shows irregular/extended lead times (multiple arrivals with L=3 and some lost/partial shipments) so using a conservative longer lead time. Set L explicitly to 3 to cover observed 3-period arrivals and reduce stockouts. Demand recent weeks average higher-than-original sample mean; to capture current regime I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 5 demand samples) so the backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and scaled std over the same window. This increases pipeline cover (L+1 periods) while keeping volatility estimate responsive to recent demand, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133), with recent evidence of 3-period arrival (Period 26). To balance service vs holding cost I set L to recent_N to reflect recent variability, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes the (1+L) forecast from the most recent demand regime and recent volatility. The large in-transit stock means orders will be capped by pipeline when OR computes final order.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133) and some missing shipments; average observed lead time ~1.8 periods. To let the OR engine internal forecast use full sample history while accounting for realized lead-time variability, I set L by calculating the average observed lead time, and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend computes demand across (1+L) review+lead using all samples. This balances service (use observed lead-time average) versus holding cost by relying on backend's base-stock computation rather than inflating explicit forecasts given irregular arrivals and suspected partial losses.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=1241 (covers multi-period demand). Historical weekly demand mean (seed samples) \u2248266.4. Concluded history shows multiple late/missing shipments => actual lead time appears longer than promised and uneven. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed \u22653-period deliveries and partial losses. Use an explicit mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 4*266.4 = 1065.6 to target coverage of review+lead demand (matches in-transit scale). Use default sigma_hat so backend computes volatility from full samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service level (due to supply unreliability) against holding cost given large existing in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed \u22653 periods with partial fulfillment irregularity: multiple orders (P1,P3) remained unarrived beyond promised lead time while some (P2) arrived with lead_time=2 \u2014 evidence of intermittent lost/ delayed shipments.

To protect service against these prolonged/irregular lead-times I set an explicit conservative lead time of 3. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend uses the full-sample demand mean and std scaled by (1+L) \u2014 this increases the forecast horizon automatically for the longer L while relying on the full historical demand signal.

To protect against delayed/partially lost shipments I set L explicitly to 3. Demand has recently averaged ~297 over the last 5 weeks (Periods 31-35), so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest regime and variability.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand 0, in-transit 1241. History shows intermittent lost/delayed shipments and multiple occasions where actual lead time >=3 (some orders unarrived beyond promised 2). To be conservative and cover observed delays, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend uses full historical sample mean/variance scaled for the chosen L. This preserves a cautious replenishment quantity given large in-transit stock while accounting for extended lead time risk.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=1254. Historical conclude messages show intermittent late/partial arrivals and multiple orders unarrived beyond promised 2 periods (evidence from Periods 1-4, 23-26, 34), supporting a longer effective lead time and risk of lost shipments. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed >=3-period delays and intermittent fulfillment so the OR backend plans for a longer pipeline. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses the full historical demand mean/variance scaled by (1+L) \u2014 this avoids overfitting to recent noisy/partial arrivals while the lead-time pattern is accounted for explicitly. This balances service level (cover extra delay) vs. holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=1241. Historical concluded arrivals show highly variable actual lead times (observed sample average \u22481.64, with occurrences of 1,2 and occasional 3) and intermittent missing/late shipments; recent concludes include several 1-period and 2-period arrivals. To let the OR engine account for observed variability I set L to 'calculate' (use average of observed lead times). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all demand samples; this balances service-level (captures longer effective lead time via calculated L) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sample average \u22481.64) and occasional lost/delayed shipments; pipeline likely contains partial fulfillments. To balance service vs holding cost I set L to the calculated average observed lead time so the OR engine accounts for realized variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, leveraging full history given no recent sustained demand regime change.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=1241 \u2014 large pipeline but historic arrivals have been irregular (mixed 1\u20133+ periods). Use calculate for L (backend will average observed lead times from concluded history) to let the model internalize the variable lead time. Demand recently (last 5 concluded periods) averages near recent level (~240\u2013306 weekly), so set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to focus forecast on the latest regime; use default sigma_hat so backend computes volatility from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L). This combination keeps safety driven by observed lead-time variability while avoiding overstating mean demand from older data, balancing service level against $1/unit/period holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent concluded history shows intermittent late/partial arrivals and several orders arriving with lead_time \u22651\u20133; some shipments appear delayed or partially lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=1241 (large pipeline but unreliable). To be conservative vs. missing shipments, set lead time explicitly to 3 periods (captures observed \u22653 delays). Demand has been stable but slightly lower in recent weeks (last 5 concluded demands: P37\u2013P41 = 306,276,241,252,210 ~ mean\u2248257). Use a recent_N=5 forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine focuses on the latest regime. These settings bias orders upward for extra cover against intermittent delayed arrivals while using recent demand statistics to limit excess holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Historical concludes show intermittent deliveries with several orders missing beyond promised LT=2 and multiple confirmed instances of lead_time >=3 and partial shipment loss. On-hand=0, in-transit=1241. I set L explicit=3 to conservatively account for observed >=3 lead times and partial fulfilment delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (most recent five weekly demands are 276,241,252,210,354 -> mean\u2248266.6) and scale by (1+L) so the OR engine targets coverage of the review+lead window under the longer LT. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to protect service given delayed/partial arrivals while limiting excessive long-term holding because holding cost equals profit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=1241. History shows multiple concluded orders with lead_time >=3 and intermittent arrivals (partial/lost shipments confirmed across many periods). To guard against longer/missing fulfillment I explicitly set L=3 (best conservative estimate supported by concluded arrivals of 3+ periods and multiple missed arrivals). Use default demand estimation so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat scaled by (1+L)=4 from all historical samples; this keeps forecasts anchored to long-run demand while letting the OR engine apply its service-level cap. This raises pipeline coverage for the review+lead horizon to reduce stockouts given irregular fulfillment.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Demand has been volatile but averaging ~late-200s historically; current on-hand=0, in-transit=1241 (some past shipments were lost/delayed). History shows intermittent lead-time breaches and partial losses so I conservatively increase lead time to 3 to avoid underordering. I let mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (backend will scale (1+L) by historical mean/std) so the OR engine recomputes demand over the longer review+lead window; this raises safety stock to protect service level while acknowledging holding cost parity (profit=holding=$1). No new sustained regime shifts beyond previously recorded irregular fulfillment.

Historical conclude messages show sustained irregular/extended lead times with multiple orders unarrived beyond promised L=2 and intermittent partial arrivals (evidence through Period 34). To be conservative against lost/delayed shipments I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L)=4; this leverages full sample history while the longer L raises target pipeline to protect service level despite fulfillment irregularity.

To be conservative I set lead time to 3 to cover observed \u22653-period delays. Demand recently (last 5 weeks) averaged moderately with some volatility; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and safety reflect the latest regime (captures holiday-week variability) and limits overreaction to older data. These settings bias orders upward to maintain service given missing/late shipments while controlling holding cost by using only 5 recent samples for variance and mean.
