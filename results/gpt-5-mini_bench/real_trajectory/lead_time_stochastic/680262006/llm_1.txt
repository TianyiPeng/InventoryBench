======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, approaching New Year). Product (women's sport tights) has seasonal peaks earlier in year; no major positive demand driver expected this week. Demand history: recent realized weekly demand is very low (Periods 41-46: 6,30,3,60-order then 6,5 sold when stocked; last several actual sales when on-hand: P45 sold 6, P46 sold 5). Longer-run regime since P16 shows much lower demand (~10 or less most weeks). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 49, in-transit = 910 but supplier has a long history of delayed/lost shipments (multiple overdue shipments including several likely lost as documented). Do not rely on in-transit units arriving. Lead time: supplier unreliable; use promised LT=2 but treat many past in-transit as effectively lost. Decision logic: target coverage = (L+1)=3 weeks. Forecast demand ~6/week (conservative). Required coverage \u224818 units; on-hand 49 already exceeds this. Given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($4), ordering risks unnecessary holding and potential further lost shipments. Therefore place no new order this period.",
