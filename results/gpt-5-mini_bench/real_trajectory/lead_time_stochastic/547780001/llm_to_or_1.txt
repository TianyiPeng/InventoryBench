Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (121,57,75,63,57) give mean ~74.6 with no evidence of regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals\u2014no overdue shipments to reconcile. Promised lead time is 2 and no observed lead-time data to contradict it, so use default lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap while avoiding overreaction to sparse data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=119 (ordered P1, arrived=0 in P1 conclude). No concluded arrivals beyond promised lead time observed, so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipment. Historical weekly demand samples mean=74.6; I use promised lead time (default) and default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (covering review+lead demand) while avoiding manual adjustments given no evidence of regime change or lead-time shift.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=233 (orders from P1/P2). Historical weekly mean demand = 74.6, std \u2248 24.1 (5 samples). No concluded arrivals yet beyond promised lead time; insufficient sustained evidence to change lead-time. Use promised lead time to let OR backend anticipate arrivals and avoid overreacting to delayed confirms. Set L=default (promised=2). Use default demand estimates: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean_all_samples and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples so base-stock reflects historical demand over review+lead period and balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand samples (historical weeks) mean ~74.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=279 (orders from P1-P3). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (119,114,46) have not concluded by Period 3 conclude \u2192 shipments overdue beyond promised L=2. To protect service and cover upcoming (1+L) periods while accounting for delayed arrivals, I set L explicit to 4 (treat lead time as extended). With L=4 I use default demand sizing so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed by backend as (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, preserving the historical forecast while letting the backend apply the capped ordering policy. This balances higher safety stock for delayed arrivals against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time extended: orders placed P1(119), P2(114), P3(46) had arrived=0 by Period 3 conclude \u2014 consistent 3-period delay indicating actual lead time >2 (treat as extended).

Daily Profit: $817.00, Daily Holding Cost: $71.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $746.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded history shows one confirmed arrival with lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4); earlier short-term delays resolved. On-hand=71, in-transit=271 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand. Using default lead time (promised=2) because the only confirmed observed lead time equals promised and missing arrivals are not a sustained new regime. Demand history mean \u224874.6/week; use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of all samples to capture (review+lead) demand and default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to reflect overall volatility. These settings let the OR backend compute base-stock consistent with long-run sample stats while avoiding overreacting to transient delays.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=23, in-transit=271 (outstanding from P1, P3, P4). History: P2 order concluded with lead_time=2; P1 and P3 remain overdue beyond promised L=2 indicating intermittent delays/lost shipments. To be conservative against delayed arrivals, set lead time explicit=3 (expects slower arrivals). Use default demand estimates (mu_hat & sigma_hat) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this scales forecasts/uncertainty for the longer review+lead period and balances service vs holding given profit=19 and holding=1.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=305. Recent concludes show mixed lead-time signals: P2 order observed lead_time=2 (arrived in P4) but multiple earlier orders experienced multi-period non-arrival, suggesting occasional extended lead time/loss risk. To be conservative vs. stockouts I set explicit L=3 (anticipate a longer effective lead time). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples, which increases target base-stock to cover 4 periods of demand and balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. On-hand=0, in-transit=320. Historical concludes show multiple delayed arrivals: orders from P1\u2013P3 had arrived=0 by P3 conclude (consistent 3-period delay), and an arrival pattern indicates actual lead time exceeded the promised 2 in earlier periods. To be conservative and cover (L+1) periods of demand, set L explicitly to 3 periods. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures historical average demand scaling with chosen L) balancing service level vs. holding cost given high in-transit and past delays.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=271 (many outstanding orders; some delayed earlier). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4: order P2), 2 (P8: order P6), 1 (P8: order P7) \u2014 variability exists but average observed lead time is best estimate. Demand has dropped from the early high (121) to a stable lower regime (~40\u201350) in the most recent 5 periods (P4\u2013P8 mean ~43.4). To balance service vs holding cost: infer L from all observed lead times (calculate) so backend uses empirical lead-time; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the new lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking given large pipeline.

Given mixed but majority 2-period observations, set L by calculate (avg observed lead time) so backend infers ~1.67. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances higher service (profit $19 vs hold $1) with holding cost while respecting inferred longer lead time and large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=271. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {P4: order P2 -> 2, P8: order P6 -> 2, P8: order P7 -> 1} (avg \u22481.67). Use recent_N for L to reflect recent observed lead-time behavior (N=3). No strong demand regime change detected versus provided historical samples, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will scale by (1+L)). This balances service (captures slightly >1 promised lead) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost is low relative to profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent observed demands (historical samples) avg \u224874.6/week. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=271 (sufficient to cover a multi-week pipeline). Lead times observed in concluded messages are mixed (observed lead_times = 2,2,1), so use calculated average lead time. Use default demand and volatility scaling so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; with large in-transit inventory this will likely produce no new order while preserving service vs holding tradeoff.

Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=271. Recent conclude history shows long stretches of zero arrivals (Periods 9-12) and earlier delays\u2014evidence of late or missing shipments. To be conservative versus lost/delayed in-transit stock, I explicitly set lead time longer than the promised 2 to cover slower arrivals. Demand history (Periods 1-12) average \u224844 units/week; using default mu/sigma (backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) lets the OR engine apply its profit/holding tradeoff while scaling to the chosen lead time. This balances service (protects against further delays) versus holding cost by increasing target stock proportionally to estimated extended lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=285. Historical conclues show multiple shipments delayed beyond promised 2 periods (Periods 1-3 orders did not arrive by P3 conclude) \u2014 consistent with an extended lead time; recent demand has moderated (last 5 periods demand = 46,24,25,44,38, avg\u224835.4). To cover review+lead demand I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime and avoid overweighting early high-Jan samples. This raises planned pipeline cover (1+L=4) while keeping variability estimate responsive, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent demand has fallen to ~25\u201344/week (recent 5 periods mean=32.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=285 (some shipments delayed historically). Historical concludes show shipments delayed beyond promised 2 periods so I assume longer lead time. I set L=3 to reflect observed multi-period delays so the OR backend plans for a longer pipeline; mu_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture current lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean_recent = 4\xd732.8 \u2248131) and sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices increase target pipeline to cover (L+1) periods of demand while avoiding excess stock from older high-demand weeks, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=285 (large pipeline but arrivals have been irregular/delayed historically). Recent demand has averaged ~36 units/week over the last 5 concluded periods (P11\u2013P15). Observed concluded lead times include 2,2,1 \u2192 average ~1.67, and earlier evidence showed extended delays; therefore use backend-calculated average lead time to capture this. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to respond to the current lower-demand regime while the backend applies the (1+L) scaling. This balances service (capture extended lead-time via calculate L) against holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than older higher peaks.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=285; recent demand avg (Periods 1-16) \u224841.75/week. Historical concludes show some shipments delayed beyond promised 2; to be conservative I set lead time explicitly to 3 to cover observed extended delays and protect service. Using mu_hat default lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean over all samples (with L=3 this yields ~167) so orders cover review+lead demand. sigma_hat default lets backend scale observed variability by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher safety stock for longer/uncertain lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats.

On-hand=0, in-transit=285 \u2014 substantial pipeline but several past periods had zero arrivals indicating volatile fulfilment; use inferred average observed lead time rather than blind promised value. Set L using calculate (average of observed concluded lead times) to reflect realized lead-time behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, maintaining a balanced service level given profit/holding cost tradeoff and the sizable in-transit units.

Historical concludes show prolonged delays earlier\u2014carry-over noted lead time extended; some later small arrivals had mixed LT but missing shipments persist. To be conservative I set L explicitly to 3 (longer than promised 2) to cover observed extended delays. Recent demand has fallen versus earlier weeks; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (last 5 demands = 33,40,29,17,30). With L=3, (1+L) window scaling will let the OR backend compute a base stock that balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while reflecting reduced recent demand and higher effective lead time.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent weekly demand has been low-moderate (last observed demands: 17,30,13) but historical sample mean from Jan-Feb is higher. On-hand=0, in-transit=285 (many periods of in-transit stock suggest earlier delayed arrivals). Concluded history shows multiple delayed arrivals beyond the promised 2-period lead time; treat current actual lead time as extended to 3 periods to be conservative against lost/delayed shipments. I set L explicit=3 to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline and avoid stockouts given observed delays. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving the long-run demand signal while accounting for the longer review+lead horizon. This balances service (avoid lost sales given delivery delays) vs holding cost by increasing coverage only via L while leaving demand/statistics to the backend.

Demand history shows low-to-moderate weekly demand since Feb. I choose to let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes to capture the realized lead-time distribution (method: calculate). For demand and volatility I use defaults so backend will scale (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given moderate profit/holding cost ratio and the uncertain lead-time. No explicit increases to mu_hat to avoid overstock while a large in-transit (285) exists and some shipments may still be delayed or lost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. Recent observed demand has been low (last 5 concluded demands: 30,13,8,13,26 \u2192 mean ~18) indicating a summer low-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=285 (large pipeline; some earlier shipments were delayed but substantial units are currently in-transit). Historical conclude messages show lead times > promised (consistent multi-period delays); therefore I explicitly set L=3 to reflect extended lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low summer demand regime over the review+lead window. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices reduce order sizing relative to long-run averages, avoiding excess holding cost while accounting for the longer effective lead time so pipeline + orders better cover (L+1) periods of expected demand.

I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed >2 period delays and to ensure pipeline covers longer arrival. Demand recently has risen from mid-June lows to ~13,8,13,26,36 (Periods 19\u201323); I detect a recent regime and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts weight current demand (N=5 chosen per recent changepoint and rules). This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while keeping variability estimated from the same recent window, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, In-transit=285. Early-period arrivals delayed (P1\u2013P3 orders showed 0 arrivals until P4), consistent with extended lead times; pipeline is large but arrival timing uncertain.

For demand I use recent_N with N=16 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime across Periods 9\u201324; same N for sigma_hat to estimate recent volatility. These parameters increase target pipeline to cover the longer effective lead time while using recent demand estimates to avoid overstock given low current demand and holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=285. Historical concluded lead-times observed: 2 (P2->P4), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8) => average ~1.67; earlier periods showed delayed arrivals but not enough recent sustained change to override. Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = 13,26,36,11,63) shows higher variability and a higher mean than the early-sample seed. To balance service vs holding cost: set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate) so backend uses empirical average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (recent_N N=5) so forecast and safety stock reflect the current demand regime and variability, leveraging the large in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=285. Historical demand shows a recent uptick (last 5 periods demands = 26,36,11,63,124 -> mean ~52) with a sharp spike at Period 26 (124). Previous periods show inconsistent arrivals; given prior evidence of extended delivery delays, I set lead time explicitly to 3 to guard against further late arrivals. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (captures the spike and near-term volatility). These choices raise the (1+L)-period demand forecast and the safety-stock calculation to reduce stockouts given delayed arrivals while limiting excess holding by using a short recent window rather than all-history averaging.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has spiked sharply (Periods 25-27: 63,124,212) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=355. Historical conclude messages show multiple delayed arrivals (Periods 1-4 evidence) \u2014 shipments have exhibited extended lead times. I set L=explicit=3 to account conservatively for the observed extended lead time so the OR engine plans for a longer pipeline. Demand forecasting uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (last 5 periods show a clear uptick), and sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase the base-stock and cap to avoid stockouts during the demand surge while recognizing higher holding cost via using recent data rather than inflating long-run averages.

Historical concluded lead-times observed = {2 (P2->P4), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8)}; use averaged observed lead time so backend adapts to realized variability. Demand historical seed (provided samples) is limited; use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. These choices keep safety stock tied to observed lead-time rather than the promised value, while relying on default demand statistics to avoid overfitting short-term spikes; that balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline uncertainty) and holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. Recent weeks show a sustained surge in demand (Periods 26-29: 124, 212, 151, 108) and multiple recent orders (P27=70, P28=222) did not arrive by Period 29 conclude despite promised L=2, consistent with prolonged delays. On-hand=0, in-transit=577; to protect service during continued delays I set explicit lead time longer than promised. I use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (covers the recent spike window) so the OR engine raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability. This balances higher service (profit per unit $19) against low holding cost ($1) by emphasizing meeting demand during delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed extended beyond promised 2 periods: orders placed P27(8/12) and P28(8/19) not arrived by P29 conclude (8/26); pattern aligns with earlier P1-P3 delays\u2014treat actual lead time \u22483 periods.

Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent conclude messages show orders ordered P27 arrived in P30 (lead_time=3) and P28 arrived in P30 (lead_time=2) plus earlier P1-P3 multi-period delays \u2014 strong evidence actual lead time has extended to ~3 periods. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 26 (demands: P26=124, P27=212, P28=151, P29=108, P30=112); use the most recent 5 periods to capture the new high-demand regime. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed 3-period lead time so the OR backend plans for the longer pipeline. Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to size base-stock and uncertainty around the new demand regime, improving service while avoiding excessive holding costs given current on-hand (180) and in-transit (341).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent concluded arrivals show extended lead time (~3 periods): e.g., order on P27 arrived in P30 (3-period lag). Demand has materially increased in recent weeks (Periods 26-30: 124,212,151,108,112) \u2014 I use the most recent 5 samples to capture this higher regime. On-hand=109 and in-transit=527 (pipeline large) but extended LT requires forecasting over (1+L)=4 periods. Choices: set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time; set mu_hat recent_N N=5 to scale forecast to the recent high-demand regime; set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher base-stock for spikes) against holding cost by targeting recent demand statistics and acknowledging extended lead time.

To cover the longer arrival delay and recent higher-demand regime I set lead time explicitly to 3. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 27-32). These parameters increase target base stock to protect service level given observed 3-period delays while sigma estimation uses the same recent window to size safety stock appropriately.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent concludes show consistent extended lead times (multiple orders arriving with W=3 observed) and earlier P1-P3 delays; on-hand=208, in-transit=367. Several shipments have arrived 3 periods after order (evidence in concludes), so treat actual lead time as 3 to cover overdue/lost shipment risk. Use L explicit=3 to force OR to plan for longer pipeline. Demand estimate and volatility use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from available samples; this balances higher safety stock from longer lead time while letting backend use full historical data for mean/variance.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: Period 30 conclude shows order P27 arrived in P30 => lead_time=3; earlier P1-P3 also showed multi-period delays).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Historical conclude messages show confirmed extended lead time = 3 periods (evidence: Period 30 conclude: order P27 arrived in P30 => lead_time=3; prior P1-P3 also showed multi-period delays). Current inventory: on-hand=130, in-transit=367 => pipeline=497. Using L=3 (explicit) ensures the OR engine plans for the longer true delivery delay and covers the review+lead horizon. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend uses the full-sample demand statistics (stable sample mean ~74.6) scaled by (1+L)=4; this yields a base-stock appropriate to the confirmed longer lead time while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock beyond what the demand history justifies. This choice accounts for missing/delayed shipments by explicitly setting L=3 so orders will be sized to cover 4 periods of demand.

Historical conclude messages show consistent multi-period delays and Period 30/34 evidence confirming actual lead time ~3 periods (orders P27 arrived in P30 => lead_time=3). To protect service given extended lead time, set L explicitly=3. Demand recently spiked in late summer (Periods 27\u201333) so use recent_N=8 to capture the most recent regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, balancing service level against holding cost while avoiding overweighting older low-demand weeks.

=== Period 36 Summary ===
547780001: ordered=48, arrived=18 units (ordered on Period 33, lead_time was 3 periods), starting on-hand inventory=135, demand=62, sold=62, ending on-hand inventory=73

Daily Reward (R_t): $1105.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time ~3 periods (evidence: P30 conclude showed P27 arrived in P30 => lead_time=3; multiple P1-P3 and P32-P35 patterns consistent). On-hand=73 + in-transit=333 => pipeline=406, which covers ~4*(recent mean demand) so no urgent shortage. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 demands: P32-P36 mean\u224872) to capture the current higher-autumn demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters align the OR base-stock to serve 4 periods of current demand while limiting holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=333. History shows confirmed multi-period delays with actual lead time = 3 (e.g., P27\u2192P30 arrival, P32\u2192P35 arrival, P33\u2192P36 arrival). Pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed; to avoid stockouts given demand run-rate in recent weeks (P30\u2013P37 demands = 112,71,58,85,78,77,62,80) I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (last 8 weeks) where demand has been elevated and more variable; this raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current demand level while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. This balances service (avoid lost sales given delayed arrivals) against holding cost by reflecting the current higher demand and delay evidence.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historic concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained evidence P27\u2192P30, P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36). Recent demand (Periods 34-38) averages ~73 units/week; seasonally elevated vs early-year samples. To ensure coverage over review+lead (1+L=4) and protect service while holding cost is low relative to profit, I set L explicitly to 3, mu_hat explicitly to 292 (4 \xd7 ~73 forecast) and sigma_hat explicitly to 16 (approx. sqrt(4)\xd7std of recent weeks \u224815.7). These parameters direct the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to utilize in-transit capacity and avoid stockouts given observed 3-period lead time.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). History shows multiple confirmed arrivals implying actual lead time \u22483 (e.g., P27->P30, P32 arrival at P35, P33 arrival at P36). On-hand=0, in-transit=318. To ensure pipeline covers review+lead demand and avoid stockouts given observed 3-period realizations, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples; this is conservative given mixed spikes in Aug/Sept and avoids overfitting to transient surges while the pipeline (318) is large.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=368. Historical conclues show a sustained shift to 3-period lead times (multiple confirms P30,P32,P35-P39). Demand recent regime (Periods 36-40) averages ~67/week; recent variability is moderate. To protect service given observed LT=3 and avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost, I use a recent lead-time estimate and recent demand stats: L via recent_N to capture the confirmed extended lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (last 5 weeks) to reflect the current demand level and volatility. This increases target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while letting the OR backend cap orders.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). History shows consistent 3-period actual lead time (multiple concluded arrivals: e.g., P27->P30, P32->P35, P33->P36). On-hand=0, in-transit=368 so pipeline exists but arrival timing is shifted. Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead-time extension. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (last 6 concluded demands ~62,77,67,66,61,74 -> higher weekly demand ~68) so the OR backend increases the base-stock for the longer lead time while sigma reflects recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given L=3) against holding cost by using recent data rather than all-time average.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning around Period 30 (large spikes and consistently higher weekly demand through Period 42). Lead time has been confirmed as 3 periods from concluded messages (evidence P27\u2192P30, P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36). On-hand=0, in-transit=368 (pipeline substantial but arrivals delayed by L=3). I set L explicitly to 3 to match observed actual lead time so the OR backend forecasts over the correct review+lead horizon. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (covering the sustained post-Period-30 regime) so mu_hat reflects the currently elevated demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=13 to capture recent volatility. This balances higher service level needs during the new regime while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: P27\u2192P30, P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39, P40\u2192P43). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 \u2014 substantial pipeline but delayed arrivals historically. Demand in recent 7 weeks (P37\u2013P43) is elevated/variable (80,67,66,61,74,91,51) indicating a higher short-term mean than early-year samples. I set L explicit=3 to match observed lead-time regime; use recent_N N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime over the review+lead horizon (1+L=4 periods). This increases target base stock to protect service level given extended lead times while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility to avoid over/under-shooting. No new carry-over patterns beyond the already-confirmed 3-period lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=323 so pipeline is sizeable but arrivals are delayed by one extra period vs promised. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time so the OR engine will size mu_hat over (1+L)=4 periods. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service level (using confirmed longer lead time) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

To avoid stockouts given large in-transit but continued demand spikes in recent weeks, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N=8 for demand estimates (most recent 8 weeks P38\u2013P45) to capture the elevated late\u2010year demand (mean \u224874/wk) so mu_hat covers (1+L) review+lead demand while keeping holding cost in check.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 periods (multiple confirms: P30 arrival patterns and Periods 32-36 arrivals). Recent demand has stepped up in Dec (Periods 44-46: demands 65,118,153) \u2014 a clear recent regime with higher mean. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed actual lead time and avoid under-ordering. For demand forecast use recent_N N=5 to capture the short, higher-demand regime (captures the recent spike while meeting the requirement N\u2208[3,20]). Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise base_stock and pipeline targets to protect service during extended lead time and elevated demand, while sigma_hat captures higher variability to balance service level vs holding cost.
