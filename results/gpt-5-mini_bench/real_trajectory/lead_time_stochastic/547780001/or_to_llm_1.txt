Decision logic: With 239 units in transit, even high recent demand (~80/wk) covers ~3 weeks (239/80\u22483.0) plus pending arrivals will continue; ordering now risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while pipeline likely suffices through lead time uncertainty.

Since we need to cover only L+1=3 future periods, the existing in-transit is sufficient to meet near-term demand even under high-demand regime. Holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), but ordering more now risks excess ending inventory if some in-transit shipments actually arrive sooner than observed or if demand reverts. Also no concluded-arrival evidence indicates new lead-time issues. Therefore order 0 to avoid increasing holdings while pipeline already meets the base-stock target implied by OR.
