Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean=130. Promised lead time retained (default) because no observed arrivals to infer a different lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level with holding cost given current lack of contrary evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~130 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=177 (order placed in Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Use promised lead time to avoid over-committing to an inferred change. Set L to default (promised=2). Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this produces a 3-period demand forecast and volatility that balances service level against holding cost given the profit/holding cost ratio. The choice is conservative given potential lost/delayed shipment risk: we keep the pipeline (177) in mind and rely on backend cap to limit order size.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded history shows two outstanding orders: Period1 ordered=177 and Period2 ordered=171 (in-transit=348) with on-hand=0; arrivals placed in P1/P2 will occur during Period3 but are only visible in the Period3 conclude read at Period4. Promised lead time is 2. Demand history (5 weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb 2019) has mean=130 units/week. I choose default lead time to trust the promised 2-period setting (avoid overfitting to only two missed concludes). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, giving a stable forecast for the review+lead period. This balances service (covering 3 periods of expected demand) against holding cost while not overreacting to two periods of unobserved arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. History shows three consecutive periods (P1-P3) where orders (177,171,112 = 460) were placed but no arrivals were concluded, while on-hand remains 0 and in-transit=460. Promised lead time=2 but shipments are overdue; to hedge stockouts I set lead time explicitly longer. Chosen L: explicit=3 to reflect observed delays (orders placed in P1 would have shown by P3 if L=2). mu_hat: default so backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) using L=3; this increases target base-stock to cover the longer review+lead horizon. sigma_hat: default so backend scales historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). These settings prioritize service (avoid lost sales) while allowing the OR cap to limit over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Lead time delay confirmed: orders placed P1-P3 (177,171,112; total 460) had arrived=0 in P1-P3 concludes, indicating actual lead time > promised 2 periods (treat as 3+ periods until arrivals observed).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent demand has been elevated (P1..P4 demands = 113,144,174,150). On-hand=21 and in-transit=462 (includes outstanding P1 and P3 orders not yet concluded). Period 4 conclude shows order from P2 arrived with lead_time=2, so actual lead time appears to be 2. I set L using calculate to use observed lead times (captures confirmed lead_time=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to base mu_hat on the last 4 realized weekly demands (captures the recent higher regime). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias inventory toward meeting current elevated weekly demand while the OR backend applies the profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order on Period 2 arrived in Period 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $399.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=487. Recent observed weekly demand has stepped up (Period1-5 demands = 113,144,174,150,168; recent mean \u2248149.8). Earlier delayed arrivals resolved and lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods (orders observed P2\u2192arrived P4). I therefore use the promised/default lead time to align with supplier performance, and set demand estimates based on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the higher current demand level. This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period forecast reflecting the elevated regime while sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This balances higher service level (to avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $475.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=493. Recent concluded lead times are mixed (observed 2,1 periods), prior orders showed delayed arrivals\u2014so we should let backend estimate average observed lead time. Demand history (P1-P6): 113,144,174,150,168,118 \u2014 no sustained regime shift; use recent 6 periods to capture current demand level and volatility. Using calculate for L lets backend average observed lead times; recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses forecasting on the most recent full six-period sample to balance service and holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent weekly demand has been volatile and elevated (last 5 demands: 174,150,168,118,181; mean ~158). On-hand=0, in-transit=505 \u2014 ample pipeline but past periods showed variable lead times (observed concludes: 2 and 1 periods). Use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to let backend reconcile variability. Use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the current elevated/volatile regime while avoiding older winter samples. Apply recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat for recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=504. Recent realized demand has stepped up vs. historical Jan samples (historical mean=130/week; recent 5-week mean=167.4/week with P4-P8 demands =150,168,118,181,220) indicating a demand regime uplift. Lead times observed in concludes are mixed (observed = 2,1,2,1); use calculated average lead time to reflect this variability. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bias the forecast toward the elevated recent demand and volatility while the pipeline remains large (so excess arrivals will be buffered). This balances higher service level from larger mu_hat against holding cost given existing in-transit units.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weekly demand has been elevated: last 5 demands = [168,118,181,220,142], avg ~166. Observed concluded lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods (evidence in Periods 4,6,8), so use calculated average lead time rather than assuming promised constant. On-hand=0, in-transit=610 \u2014 pipeline is very large relative to typical weekly demand, so use a short recent-demand window to reflect the current regime while letting the OR backend cap orders to avoid additional overstock. Chosen methods: L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (1\u20132 periods average); mu_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to forecast (1+L)-period demand from the most recent 5 weeks; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to capture recent demand volatility. These choices respond to the mixed lead-time evidence and recent high demand while avoiding expanding forecasts from older data that would exacerbate the large in-transit position.

Period 11 (2019-04-22): recent demand (Periods 4-10) shows a sustained higher regime vs. Jan samples (periods with demand: 150,168,118,181,220,142,116) so I forecast using the recent regime. On-hand=32 and in-transit=462 provide ample pipeline, and recent concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time reverted to promised 2 periods (no sustained >2 delay since Period 5). Therefore use promised lead time (default) and compute demand (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the most recent regime (N=7) to capture the higher recent mean and variance while letting the OR backend apply the high service level implied by profit/holding.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=543 \u2014 sizable pipeline but arrivals observed have varied and some orders were delayed earlier. Observed concluded lead times in history = {2,1,2,1,2,1} -> use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 1\u201311) shows a higher, noisier regime than the Jan samples; use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the full recent history (covers current March\u2013April demand spike). These choices balance service (use observed lead-time average) versus holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base-stock from recent demand mean and variance while respecting pipeline inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has been high and variable (last concluded demands: P9=142, P10=116, P11=121, P12=157) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=545 units. Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) are mixed: {2,1,2,1,2,1} \u2192 average 1.5. Earlier multi-period delays were seen but later periods show mostly 1\u20132 periods, so use the average observed lead time rather than the promised value. I choose L via calculate to reflect the empirical average (1.5). For demand, use default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples) because the provided historical sample set (2019-01 samples mean=130) is limited but representative; this keeps the OR engine\u2019s baseline forecast consistent and lets it scale with the inferred L. For volatility, use default so the backend scales std by sqrt(1+L). This combination balances service (captures increased effective lead time) and holding cost (avoids over-explicit inflation of mu/sigma given large in-transit pipeline).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=518 which is ample pipeline but prior concludes show mixed lead times (observed lead times: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2) suggesting average actual lead time ~1.63. Use calculated average observed lead time to let backend adapt to observed variability; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults based on all samples so the base-stock uses the full-sample mean (conservative given limited data). This balances service (using observed lead time) vs holding cost (not inflating demand forecast). No single recent demand regime change is strongly sustained, so full-sample stats retained.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27. Recent demand is high (last observed weekly demands up to 185); on-hand=0, in-transit=523. Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 2 with some 1s (observed lead times average \u22481.6), so use calculated lead time to capture actual behavior rather than blind promised=2. Use default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_of_all_samples based on the chosen L; this keeps forecasting anchored to long-run sample mean (mean=130) while the calculated L inflates the review+lead horizon to cover extra periods and reduce stockouts given many recent large demands and prior delayed arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=531. Historical concluded lead times (observed) = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2] \u2192 average ~1.625; I'll let backend compute authoritative average from observed lead times (method=calculate). Demand recently has been elevated and variable (recent demands over last 8 concluded periods: 150,168,118,181,220,142,116,121 \u2192 higher than early-sample mean), so I use a recent_N forecast to focus the base-stock on the last 8 periods. I keep sigma at default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled for (1+L). These settings aim to reflect the slightly shorter-than-promised average lead time while sizing mu_hat to recent higher demand to avoid stockouts given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals.

Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=518. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2) but average near 1.6 periods; pipeline is large but arrivals have been variable. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average (captures 1/2 mix). Demand has softened from earlier highs; last 5 concluded demands = [138,170,185,117,100], mean=142. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep safety stock tied to recent demand while letting OR backend adjust base stock for the measured lead-time variability and the large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, large in-transit=528 which already covers many weeks of demand; recent realized weekly demand has settled lower than early-year spikes. Recent demand (Periods 14-18 = 170,185,117,100,87) shows a cohesive recent regime; use recent_N=5 to capture that regime. Use promised lead time (default=2) since recent concludes (Periods 4-18) show mostly 1-2 period arrivals and a previous temporary delay has been resolved. Choosing recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat biases the base-stock toward current lower demand while the large in-transit provides downside protection, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has trended downward from mid-May peaks (185 \u2192 79 over P15\u2013P19) but historical weekly mean (~136) remains relevant. On-hand=0, in-transit=518 \u2014 pipeline is large so avoid inflating targets. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times vary but most evidence supports promised L=2 (Period 5 confirmed L=2). I select L=default to keep promised lead time; set mu_hat via EWMA (gamma=0.3) to bias the forecast toward recent lower demand while still smoothing; keep sigma_hat=default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This combination reduces risk of over-ordering given the large in-transit balance and recent demand decline while maintaining service-level weighting through the OR backend.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent weekly demand has been variable but generally between ~49\u2013185; on-hand=0, in-transit=518 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show typical lead time around 1\u20132 periods with several 2-period observations; prior carry-over flagged temporary delays but later confirms of 2-period arrivals. Given substantial pipeline inventory and no new sustained demand regime shift, use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine caps orders using its historical sample stats and the large in-transit stock. This avoids over-ordering while letting the backend compute base_stock against observed demand.

Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent weekly demand has been volatile but historical seed samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~130 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=518 (large pipeline). Lead time history contains mixed 1\u20132 period observations with a prior confirmed 2-period observation; I will use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine applies its standard L=2 assumption. With L=default the backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect multi-period demand (covers current+L periods) and sigma_hat=default to capture observed variability; keeping defaults avoids overreacting to noisy short-term arrivals while the large in-transit inventory reduces immediate ordering urgency.

On-hand=0, in-transit=518 (large pipeline). Historical lead times recently settled around 1\u20132 periods; no sustained evidence to override the promised lead time. To avoid overstocking given large pipeline and lower recent demand, set lead time to default (promised=2) and estimate demand and volatility from the most recent 5 periods so the OR engine lowers target base-stock to match the summer demand regime.

Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 4 periods to reflect the current lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk while leveraging large in-transit balance. This tightens the forecast and lowers safety stock given observed demand decline and holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Historical concluded lead times show 1\u20132 periods with a confirmed 2-period observation (Period 2\u21924); no new sustained lead-time change detected. Pipeline (518) is large relative to recent weekly demands, so use conservative defaults tied to promised lead time. Selected L=default to keep promised lead time (2) given mixed evidence; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring the backend balances service level vs holding cost using full-history statistics.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weekly demand has been low-to-moderate (historic samples provided). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=518. Multiple conclude messages show variable actual lead times (mix of 1 and 2 periods). However there have been no arrivals reported for the last 6 concludes (Periods 20-25) despite in-transit units, suggesting shipment delays/loss risk. To let the OR engine infer lead time from observed history while keeping demand forecasts simple and robust, I choose L=calculate (use average observed lead time), and default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples. This balances service level (using observed lead time) against holding cost sensitivity by relying on the engine's capped ordering policy rather than forcing a larger explicit forecast.

Carry-over insight: Possible lost/delayed shipments: in-transit=518 with no arrivals in Periods 20-25 (6 consecutive concludes) \u2014 treat lead time as unreliable until arrivals confirm.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=518 but no arrivals in Periods 20-26 (6 consecutive concludes) indicating shipments are delayed/unreliable. Promised lead time=2, but recent missing arrivals suggest effective lead time may be longer; to be conservative I set L explicit=3 to cover additional delay risk. Demand history (samples mean \u2248130/week) supports using the backend default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility; this balances higher service level against holding cost given large in-transit uncertainty.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): on-hand=0, in-transit=638. Recent history shows many multi-period arrival gaps and possible lost/delayed shipments (Periods 20-26 had six consecutive concludes with no arrivals). To be conservative I set lead time longer than promised to protect service level while backend uses demand stats. Choose L explicit=3 to reflect unreliable/occasionally extended lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging full historical demand given no confirmed sustained demand regime shift.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=638 with no arrivals in Periods 20-28 (9 consecutive concludes) suggesting delayed/unreliable lead time despite promised L=2. Recent demand has moderated versus early-year peaks; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 24-28) = [47,58,127,116,76], mean \u224884.8. To be conservative vs. missing arrivals, set lead time explicit=3 (treat as longer than promised until arrivals confirm). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N N=5 to capture the current lower summer regime ((1+L) factor applied in backend). Use recent_N N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise cover for delayed arrivals while avoiding over-weighting early high-winter demand, balancing service level vs. holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$19.

Carry-over insight: Lead time unreliable: in-transit=638 with no arrivals in Periods 20-28 (9 consecutive concludes); treat actual lead time as 3 periods until arrivals confirm.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=638 with no arrivals in Periods 20-29 => lead time appears longer/unreliable. I set L explicitly to 3 to be conservative (treat shipments as arriving ~3 periods out) so pipeline coverage and ordering cadence account for delays. Recent demand (Periods 20-29) = [49,64,55,78,47,58,127,116,76,86], mean=75.6; I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to capture the current lower/mid demand regime and multiply by (1+L) in backend. I use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher safety stock for unreliable lead time vs. modest holding cost (profit $19, holding $1).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=12, in-transit=518 with recent concluded arrivals showing variable lead times (P30: order P27 arrived with lead_time=3). Multiple recent periods (P20\u2013P29) had no arrivals despite in-transit volume, so treat operational lead time as longer than promised. I set L explicit to 3 to reflect observed 3-period arrival (avoids under-ordering given large in-transit uncertainty). Demand recently (P20\u2013P30) averages higher and more variable than the very early 2019 samples; I use recent_N=11 (periods 20\u201330 inclusive) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts over the review+lead horizon using the most relevant regime. This balances service (higher base_stock) against holding cost given high in-transit and unreliable arrivals.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent concludes show an order placed in Period 27 arrived in Period 30 (lead_time=3); overall lead time has been unreliable. On-hand=0, in-transit=518. Recent demand (Periods 26-31): [127,116,76,86,108,154], mean=111.17. With L=3, review+lead horizon = 4 periods \u2192 horizon demand \u2248 4\xd7111.17=444.7, so current pipeline (518) already covers expected demand for the horizon. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed 3-period lead time; mu_hat recent_N (N=6) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (6 most recent demand observations), which captures the current lower-than-earlier-season variability and avoids outdated early-year samples. These parameters prevent unnecessary new orders while maintaining service given the long in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (order placed Period 27 arrived Period 30, lead_time=3).

Recent concluded history (Period 30) confirms actual lead time = 3 periods (order P27 arrived P30) and multiple late/no-arrival periods indicate unreliable/longer lead times. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative. Recent demand has been higher than the historical Jan baseline; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime (demands in Periods 28-32: 76,86,108,154,153) so the OR engine will target coverage for (1+L) periods based on current demand and recent volatility while accounting for delayed arrivals.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=583. Historical concludes show lead time confirmed as 3 periods (P27\u2192P30 arrival) and multiple delayed shipments earlier; treat actual L=3 to be conservative. Recent demand has jumped (Periods 29\u201333 = 86,108,154,153,290; recent mean=~158). To cover review+lead (1+L=4) periods and reflect the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5. Volatility also appears elevated in the same recent window; use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5. These choices increase target base stock to improve service during the confirmed longer lead time and recent demand spike while sigma_hat captures higher uncertainty so the OR backend can size safety stock appropriately.

Many prior long delays/lost shipments make promised LT unreliable. To ensure pipeline covers review+lead demand under the confirmed longer lead time, set L explicitly to 3.

Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=852. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 periods (order P27 arrived P30; order P32 arrived P35). Demand has shifted up recently (last 5 period demands: 154,153,290,192,177 \u2192 mean \u2248193). To cover review+lead period and respond to the higher recent demand regime, set L explicit=3 and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility over the most relevant 5-sample window. This balances higher service needs from the demand spike while avoiding excessive inventory given large in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=914; recent concluded history shows actual lead time confirmed as 3 periods (Period 27\u219230, Period 32 arrivals) and prior unreliable arrivals\u2014treat L=3. Recent demand has stepped up (Periods 33-36: 290,192,177,145) so I use a recent_N forecast over the last 4 periods to capture the current higher regime. Set mu_hat as recent_N (N=4) -> backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 4 demands (captures spike and short-run level). Set sigma_hat as recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices protect against stockouts given long/unreliable lead time while avoiding excessive holding by using a short recent window rather than the full historical series.

Pipeline is large but arrivals have been delayed historically; to be conservative use L=3. Demand has jumped recently (Periods 33-37: 290,192,177,145,200); I use a recent_N forecast to capture the new high-demand regime (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current mean/volatility over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (higher base_stock for elevated recent demand and longer lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit but unreliable arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=914. Historical concludes show intermittent lead-time unreliability with confirmed 3-period arrivals (e.g. P27->P30, P32 evidence); recent arrivals also sometimes show 1-2 periods, so treat operational lead time as 3 until further confirmation. Demand has increased recently; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [192,177,145,200,163] (Periods 34-38) \u2014 use a recent-window forecast to capture the current high-demand regime. I set L explicitly to 3 to protect against observed multi-period delays and avoid under-ordering. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to size (1+L)-period expected demand using the most recent regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices favor service (reduce stockouts from delayed arrivals) while the OR backend's cap limits over-ordering to control holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent observed lead times have settled at 3 periods (see arrivals from orders placed P27->arrived P30 and subsequent 3-period arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=807 (large pipeline). Demand recent five weeks: [177,145,200,163,135], mean=164. To match the recent regime and unreliable shorter lead-time signals, set lead time to explicit 3. Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher-variance weekly demand; this yields (1+L)*mean over recent 5. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings prioritize service (given large pipeline and confirmed L=3) while using recent demand stats to avoid over-ordering beyond pipeline coverage.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Recent history shows actual lead time has been unreliable but was confirmed as 3 periods (P27\u2192P30, P32 arrivals) and several recent arrivals reflect LT=3; on-hand=0, in-transit=807. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed 3-period lead time (safer than promised 2). Demand has stepped up since Period 33 (several weeks of high demand: 290,192,177,145,200,163,135,166); I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on this new high-demand regime and recent volatility. These parameters will raise base-stock to protect against stockouts given longer LT and higher recent demand while keeping volatility measured from the same recent window to avoid over-ordering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=893. Historical concluded arrivals show highly variable lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods, with multiple prolonged delays and many periods with zero arrivals). Recent demand has been elevated: last 6 concluded demands (P36\u2013P41) = [145, 200, 163, 135, 166, 164], indicating a higher recent mean than the full-sample average. Because shipments remain unreliable and several past orders experienced 3-period lead times, I explicitly set lead time to 3 to be conservative. For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the elevated recent regime; same N for volatility to reflect recent dispersion. These choices bias orders upward to cover (L+1) periods of higher recent demand and protect against missed arrivals while balancing holding cost through the OR backend's capped policy.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent history shows a confirmed 3-period actual lead time (Period 32 evidence). Period 42 demand spiked (862) likely a seasonal/Black-Friday effect; the last 5 demand samples (Periods 38-42) capture this regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=893 \u2014 this pipeline is large and covers multiple (1+L)=4 periods, so we avoid increasing lead-time exposure. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the five most recent demand points, allowing the model to respond to the recent spike while keeping variability estimates aligned with current data and limiting excess orders.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1\u20133), most recently order on P41 arrived in P43 (lead_time=2). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1625 covers multiple periods of demand; some past shipments were delayed but recent evidence favors ~2 periods. I set L to recent_N to let backend average the latest observed lead times (captures recent shift back to 2). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample demand stats scaled by 1+L) because demand history is limited but stable and the large pipeline gives buffer; this balances service level vs holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1625 (large pipeline, multiple past delayed/lost shipments). Recent concludes show a sustained higher demand in late Nov/Dec (Periods 40-44 demands = 166,164,862,227,131) and lead-time history includes confirmed 3-period arrivals (Period 32) and multiple unreliable delays. To be conservative I set L explicitly to 3 (treat actual lead time as 3 until further arrivals confirm otherwise). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-winter demand regime (gives (1+L)-period demand forecast anchored to the last 5 weeks). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the current peak while relying on the large in-transit stock to limit additional overordering; using recent samples raises the base-stock to match the short-term spike while sigma from recent data calibrates safety stock vs holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent history shows mixed lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods) but recent large arrivals (P45 conclude: 818 units arrived from P43, lead_time=2) so no clear sustained shift away from promised lead time. Current position: on-hand=661, in-transit=1444 (total pipeline=2105) \u2014 ample cover for near-term demand including holiday week spikes. To avoid over\u2010reacting to intermittent delays and lost shipments, use the promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies the established statistical forecast. This prevents overly aggressive ordering that would raise holding costs given already-large pipeline.
