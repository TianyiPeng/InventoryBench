A reasonable central estimate is ~140 units/week. c) Lead-time / pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Supplier promised LT=2 periods; no concluded arrivals observed to contradict that. d) Inventory decision: Because profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1/period) and there is no pipeline, prioritize service level.

Forecast 3\xd7140 = 420 units. e) Final order logic: Place order for 420 units to cover expected demand over next three periods and reduce stockout risk while holding cost impact is modest.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-23 is the Christmas week where demand can be elevated, but the major Black Friday spike has passed (observed P42=862). Recent realized demand (P43\u2013P45) averaged ~171/week (227,131,157). Lead time behavior: recent evidence shows orders placed on P43 arrived on P45 (lead_time=2), so treat supplier lead_time as 2. Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=103, In-transit=991 \u2192 total available =1,094. Forecast & coverage: Conservatively forecast elevated holiday demand ~200/week; with promised lead_time=2 we need to cover L+1=3 weeks \u2192 required \u2248600 units. Given total pipeline (1,094) >> required demand, placing additional order risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) and reduces objective. Action: place no order this period.",

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas); recent demand has declined from the Dec peak (P42=862) back toward ~80\u2013160/week (P43\u2013P46 = 227,131,157,83). Lead time: historical concludes show actual lead_time \u22482 periods is valid (several P->P+2 arrivals) though occasional 1-period arrival occurred; no evidence of additional losses now. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=20, in-transit=991 => total available \u22481011 units arriving over coming periods. Forecast: near-term weekly demand expected ~80\u2013150 (post-peak). Given very large pipeline relative to expected demand, additional ordering would raise holding costs without improving sales. Action: place no order this period to reduce holding cost exposure and let pipeline absorb demand.",
