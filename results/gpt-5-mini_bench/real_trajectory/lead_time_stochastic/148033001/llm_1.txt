Lead time evidence: prior carry-over confirms actual lead time variable 1\u20132 periods (observed arrivals). Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=340. Required coverage = (L+1) periods = 3 weeks of demand. Forecast 3-week demand \u2248 3\xd7102 = 306 units. In-transit (340) currently exceeds this requirement, so no immediate replenishment is needed and placing an order risks extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) during a volatile pipeline where some orders have been previously delayed. Decision: do not order this period and let in-transit inventory arrive and be observed in subsequent concludes; reassess next period using updated arrival confirmations.",

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas) \u2014 expect elevated demand for womens hosiery. Recent demand (P42\u2013P45): 159, 85, 132, 177 \u2192 recent mean \u2248138/week and high variance. Lead-time evidence: historical actual lead time variable 1\u20132 periods (confirmed earlier); supplier pipeline previously unreliable but recent in-transit=340 is available. Decision logic: with promised LT=2, cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand to protect current period's sales and allow for 1\u20132 period arrival variability. Target stock = 3 \xd7 140 \u2248 420 units.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas week). Recent weeks show a strong December holiday spike in demand for this women's hosiery SKU (P43\u2013P46: 85,132,177,132). Product fits gift/seasonal buying, so elevated demand in Dec is plausible but likely to ease after the holiday. Demand analysis: recent demand regime is high (avg ~131 over last 4 weeks) vs. earlier months much lower; this appears seasonal (holiday) rather than a permanent new baseline. Lead time / pipeline: history shows variable/unstable lead times (1\u20132 periods observed) and episodes of delayed/lost shipments; in-transit = 420 units (includes prior undelivered orders, incl. P46 ordered=80). Inventory & pipeline assessment: on-hand=0, in-transit=420 likely to arrive within 1\u20132 periods but timing is uncertain; ordering now risks overstock if shipments arrive quickly or being necessary if shipments are lost. Decision logic: given large in-transit volume (420) versus one-week demand expectation (post-holiday demand likely lower than peak but could still be substantial), plus holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit, avoid additional orders this period to prevent unnecessary holding cost and to wait for confirmation of arrivals or evidence of lost shipments in conclude messages.",
