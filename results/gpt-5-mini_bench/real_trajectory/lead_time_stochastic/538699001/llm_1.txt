Lead time: supplier promised 2 periods; no concluded arrivals yet to contradict. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so current period demand will go unmet. Economics: profit = $1/unit, holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is very costly, so avoid large safety stocks; prefer ordering roughly one expected-period demand to avoid excessive end-period holding. Forecast: use most recent observed demand as best single-period estimate (~190 units). Order logic: place an order to cover approximately one period of expected demand at arrival (order placed now will arrive in Period 3 given promised LT=2). Do not build extra safety stock due to 1:1 holding cost to profit ratio and limited evidence of sustained higher demand.",
