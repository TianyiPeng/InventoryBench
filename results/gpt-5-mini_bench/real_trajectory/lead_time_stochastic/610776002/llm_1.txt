Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised LT=2; currently On-hand=0, In-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet, so assume promised LT until contradicted. Decision logic: must cover L+1 = 3 future periods of demand (current period's demand occurs after ordering). Using recent elevated demand as primary signal, estimate weekly demand in the near term ~300 units (conservative vs last observed 308, accounting for some volatility). Thus target coverage = 3 * 300 = 900 units. Profit per sold unit = $4; holding cost = $1/unit/period \u2014 the profit margin justifies stocking to meet demand while avoiding extreme overstock.

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 date 2019-12-23 is the week before Christmas; typically raises apparel demand, but recent Dec historical demand for this SKU is low (~55\u201364/week), so no clear large holiday spike. Demand forecast: use recent observed weekly demand ~60\u201370 units. Lead time / pipeline: historical evidence (carry-over) shows variable/unreliable lead times and some lost shipments; current in-transit=3123 likely includes several late/unreliable shipments. Inventory assessment: on-hand=256 units covers ~3\u20134 weeks at forecasted demand (256 / 70 \u2248 3.7 weeks). Holding vs profit: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period -> excessive overstock costly. Given uncertain pipeline and sufficient on-hand to cover the next (L+1)=3 periods, avoid placing new order this period. Action: place 0 units to avoid additional holding cost and prevent tying capital into unreliable in-transit stock.",

{
  "rationale": "Date/world knowledge: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (week of New Year). Product is womens' lightweight T-shirt \u2014 modest seasonal impact; possible slight uplift around holiday clearance but recent Dec demand has been low. Demand regime: recent concluded weeks show low weekly demand (P43=61, P44=55, P45=64, P46=92) -> short-run demand ~70\u201390/week; no evidence of a new sustained spike. Lead time & pipeline: history shows variable/unreliable lead times (1\u20133 periods) and prior lost shipments; many earlier in-transit quantities have been unreliable. Current inventory: on-hand=164, in-transit=3123 (treat as unreliable/unconfirmed). Risk policy: be conservative about relying on large in-transit; plan to cover (L+1) demand where L uncertain (use 2\u20133 periods). Forecast & order logic: forecast ~80 units demand next period; target cover ~3 periods (~240 units) to be robust vs variable lead time. With 164 on-hand, order \u2248240\u2212164 = 76 units. Round to 80 for operational simplicity while limiting holding cost. Order 80 units.",
