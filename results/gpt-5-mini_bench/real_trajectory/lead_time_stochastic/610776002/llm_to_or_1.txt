Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU 610776002 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks to 2019-02-04) show no sustained regime shift; no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time deviations. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service vs holding cost given lack of contrary evidence.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 (ordered P1) but arrived=0 in P1 conclude \u2192 cannot yet infer actual lead time (may still be in-transit). Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks to 2019-02-04) show mean \u2248204.8. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently with its capped policy. This avoids overreacting to a single delayed arrival while providing the backend with standard safety stock sizing to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand samples (148,175,160,233,308) show elevated but not yet a sustained regime change; on-hand=0, in-transit=635 equals orders placed in P1+P2 (314+321). No concluded arrivals observed, so cannot confirm actual lead time differs from promised (2). Use default lead time (promised=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a neutral forecast ((1+2)\xd7mean) that covers current period+lead and balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. History: three consecutive conclude messages (Periods 1-3) show ordered=314/321/156 and arrived=0 despite in-transit=791 now on-hand=0, indicating shipments are delayed or lost. This is sustained (3 periods) so I raise the assumed lead time to 3 to protect against understock. Demand samples mean=204.8 (five samples); I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with the chosen L to increase cover for the longer effective pipeline and balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears extended: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (314,321,156) all arrived=0; treat actual lead time as >=3 periods until contradicted.

Daily Profit: $1132.00, Daily Holding Cost: $38.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1094.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concludes show heavy demand (Period1-3 demand 266/316/306) and Period4 conclude delivered 321 units (ordered P2) with observed lead_time=2. On-hand=38, in-transit=754; some earlier orders never concluded (possible lost shipments) but we lack sustained proof to change promised LT. Choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (captures the confirmed W=2); use default demand and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_all_samples respectively, preserving the historical baseline while the OR engine applies its capped policy. This balances service (use observed LT) against holding cost given existing large pipeline and uncertain missing shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent realized weekly demand has risen markedly versus older samples: Periods 1-5 demand = [266,316,306,283,252], recent mean = 284.6 (5-week). On-hand=0, in-transit=792 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals uncertain historically). Observed lead-time evidence: Period 4 conclude shows an arrival of the Period 2 order with lead_time=2, so use observed average lead time. To capture the sustained upward demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (uses the last 5 demand samples). Use L='calculate' to reflect the empirical observed lead times. These parameters increase target base-stock to improve service during the higher-demand regime while sigma from recent data captures elevated variability; relying on recent samples also mitigates risk from earlier low-demand historical samples and addresses missing/delayed shipment noise by using observed lead-time calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods 1-5 recent mean demand = 284.6 vs prior sample mean = 204.8 (+39%); Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order on Period 2 arrived on Period 4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, In-transit=855 (orders in periods 1-6 net undelivered). Recent demand has shifted up: Periods 2-6 demands = 316,306,283,252,270 (sustained higher level vs older snapshot). Observed lead times from concluded messages: order P2->arrived P4 = 2, order P5->arrived P6 = 1 (avg=1.5). Use lead-time estimate as the average of observed lead times to let backend adapt to observed variability. For demand, use recent_N on the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the new higher regime and avoid dilution from older low-demand samples. Apply recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while keeping sigma based on recent variability so the capped order limits remain sensible given holding cost vs profit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has shifted higher (recent 7-period mean \u2248 293.9 vs earlier samples), and concluded arrivals show mixed lead-time evidence but promised lead time=2 remains reasonable. On-hand=0, in-transit=895 (large pipeline). To capture the recent higher demand regime while keeping lead-time at the promised value for the OR engine, I use L=default and set demand estimates from the most recent regime (recent_N=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 7 observed demands (periods 1\u20137). This raises the base-stock to meet (1+L) periods of the new demand level while sigma_hat from the same recent window captures current volatility; using recent_N avoids diluting the forecast with older lower-demand samples. No new sustained lead-time or seasonal insights to record.

Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=797 (large pipeline). Lead time evidence in concludes shows mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals; use observed average lead time to let backend reconcile variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the new higher-demand regime while capping exposure because pipeline is already large.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1006. Recent demand (Periods 1-9) has risen to mean=300 units/week versus historic sample mean=204.8 (+47%); this is a sustained higher-demand regime across 9 periods. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,1,2,1} (avg=1.5) but promised lead time=2 and recent arrivals are mixed; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed data while leaving mu/sigma driven by recent demand. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture the higher recent mean/volatility, so the OR engine increases target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand regime while recognizing pipeline (in-transit=1006) will cover demand in coming weeks.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-10) is uniformly higher than earlier sample set (period mean \u2248 ~ = mean of last 10 periods \u2248 305), so I bias the forecast to the recent regime. Observed concluded lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods; I'll let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded messages. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 demand samples to capture the sustained elevated demand regime and its volatility. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while keeping sigma based on recent variability to limit excess holding cost given on-hand=0 and in-transit=754.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand has increased sharply: last 5 demands = [364,372,271,310,564], recent mean \u2248 376.2. Pipeline is large (in-transit=963) and on-hand=0; several recent concludes show mixed lead times (1 and 2), so use observed-average lead time rather than promised. Set L by calculating the average of concluded lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime and recent volatility, so the OR backend raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while the cap still limits order spikes.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=1294 (large pipeline). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5) \u2014 recent behavior alternates 1\u20132. Demand has shifted up starting Period 7: recent 6-period mean (P7\u2013P12)=384.17 vs earlier mean \u2248285; elevated demand is persistent for 6 periods. To balance service vs holding cost: set lead time estimate using recent average (captures 1\u20132 alternation), and set demand forecast and volatility using the last 6 periods (captures the new higher regime) so the OR backend's base-stock and cap reflect the higher demand while pipeline already provides substantial cover.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent history shows confirmed higher-demand regime since Periods 1-5 and mixed observed lead times of 1\u20132 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1094 (ample pipeline). To reflect observed short lead-times while weighting recent confirmations, I set L using recent_N to average the last 5 observed lead times. Demand forecast and volatility use recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated recent demand regime and recent variability. These choices keep base_stock responsive to higher demand while the large in-transit position limits immediate ordering aggressiveness.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=969. Recent concluded arrivals show most actual lead times are 2 periods with occasional 1-period arrivals; average of observed lead times \u22481.63. Demand has been elevated vs the original sample (recent weeks high), but no new sustained regime change detected beyond previously noted shift. I select L='calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the backend applies (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR engine combine the inferred lead time with historic demand statistics to set base-stock while respecting the capped order cap and balancing service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1055. Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 1-2 period lead times with multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals (P4, P8, P10, P13, P14) and some 1-periods\u2014use calculated average lead time to capture this mix. Demand has clearly increased vs the very early samples; use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) to capture the current high-demand regime and set both mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand observations to reflect current mean and volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory already present.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent weeks show substantially higher demand (multiple 300-500 weeks) and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=1434. Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times but overall average lead time >1 with many 2-period observations; use a calculated average lead time to reflect observed behavior. Use default demand and volatility aggregations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies historical demand scaling consistent with the inferred L. This balances service (higher L -> larger review+lead demand) against holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=969. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1} (avg=1.625) but recent history and previous carry-over confirm typical actual lead time \u22482. Demand has been in a higher regime since Periods 11\u201317 (large weekly demands). To capture the recent elevated demand and reduce stockouts given in-transit uncertainty, I set L using observed lead times (calculate) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (Periods 11\u201317) so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period coverage based on the current high-demand regime while reflecting recent volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17): recent demand has been high and volatile with multiple large weekly outs; on-hand=0, in-transit=1547. Observed concluded lead times (from history) average \u22481.7 periods, so I let the backend compute the empirical average (calculate). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L) and \u221a(1+L) respectively\u2014this balances service level given elevated demand while avoiding manual understating of variance given recent volatility.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24): on-hand=139, in-transit=969. Recent weekly demand has been consistently high (Periods 15-19: 442,435,640,419,439). Observed concluded lead times vary (multiple 1s and 2s); average of observed lead times \u22481.545 so use calculate to capture realized lead-time behavior. For demand I target the most recent regime (last 5 periods) to reflect the sustained higher demand; sigma uses the same recent window to match volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher service (covering (1+L) periods of elevated demand) while letting the OR engine cap orders via its internal cap to limit excess inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=1422 \u2014 large pipeline but no visible arrivals this period (arrivals appear one period after they occur). Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20132 periods); use calculate so backend infers average observed lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime (N=15 covers Periods 6\u201320). This raises target base-stock to meet sustained higher demand while sigma from the same window captures current volatility, balancing profit vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Historical concluded lead times alternate between 1 and 2 periods (many 2s and some 1s); use calculated average lead time to reflect observed mix. Demand has stayed in the higher regime confirmed earlier (recent weekly mean ~285 vs prior ~205) but this was already recorded; therefore use default demand and volatility estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies the correct scaling once L is computed. This balances service (captures recent higher mean via L-based scaling) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1144. Recent concluded history shows variable but mostly 1\u20132 period lead times; use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to reflect realized pattern. Demand has moved to a higher regime vs early samples (sustained higher weekly demand across many periods); to capture the current demand level and recent volatility I use recent_N=10 to focus the forecast on the most recent 10 demand observations. These parameters aim to size the base-stock to meet service with recent demand while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit excess inventory given holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=1276 units. Historical concluded lead times are mixture of 1\u20132 periods (avg ~1.58). Recent demand (Periods 21\u201325) is subdued vs earlier peaks: recent 5-period mean ~208.6 units. To reflect observed lead-time behavior use calculated average lead time; to adapt to current lower demand use a recent_N mu_hat (N=5). Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so OR backend retains full historical volatility. These choices balance service (accounting for ~1.6 period lead) vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=1276 (large pipeline). Recent demand (Periods 22-26) shows a sustained downward regime so I downweight long-run samples. I keep L='default' (use promised lead time=2) because concluded arrivals in history are mixed (1\u20132) and no new confirmed change to actual lead time. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 weeks, capturing the recent lower demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend target service with lower target stock given the recent demand drop while the large in-transit position prevents aggressive ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 22-26: recent mean = 182.6 (Periods 22-26) vs prior recent mean 284.6 (Periods 1-5) \u2192 -35.8%; sustained 5-period decline observed.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has shifted lower: Periods 22-26 mean=182.6 (vs prior ~284.6); Period 27 demand=120 confirms lower regime. On-hand=12, in-transit=1144 (large pipeline) so no urgent catch-up needed. Promised lead time is 2 and recent concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period behavior\u2014no sustained lead-time change. I therefore use L=default to keep promised lead time, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to target the new lower demand regime (uses last 5 weeks: P22\u2013P26), and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend builds a base-stock sized to the confirmed lower-demand regime while recognizing the large in-transit pipeline to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has declined vs earlier regime (Periods 22-26 mean ~182.6 vs prior ~284.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=1144 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; to reflect actual behavior I use calculate for L (average of observed lead times). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent lower-demand regime (Periods 22\u201326) so base-stock scales down and avoids excess holding given sizable in-transit. This balances service (use actual lead-time average) against holding cost by forecasting demand with the recent 5-period regime and matching volatility to recent variability.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has shifted down vs earlier regime (Periods 25-29 demands = 154,102,120,158,140; 5-period mean \u2248134.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=1144 which comfortably covers (1+L) periods for a small-L forecast. Historical concluded arrivals mostly support promised lead time = 2, so use default promised L to keep OR engine assumptions consistent. To adapt to the sustained lower demand regime identified at Period 27, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods (captures current mean and volatility). This reduces excess holding while preserving service; in-transit stock (1144) already provides cover while the backend refills to the revised base stock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has declined vs earlier regime: last 5 demands (Periods 26-30) = [102,120,158,140,145], mean=133. On-hand=0, in-transit=1144 (ample pipeline covering multiple periods). Lead time historically fluctuated but was repeatedly observed as 2 periods; no sustained evidence to override promised lead time. To avoid overstocking given the sustained lower-demand regime, set L to default (promised=2) so backend uses contractual lead time, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new lower mean and reduced variability from the most recent 5-week regime. This reduces target base-stock and caps order size to limit holding costs while preserving service from large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 26-30: recent mean=133 (Periods 26-30) vs prior recent mean=182.6 (Periods 22-26) \u2192 -27%; sustained 5-period decline observed.

No new sustained lead-time signal; recent concluded arrivals show lead_time\u22482 historically. To keep responsiveness to the recent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods. This yields (1+L)-scaled forecast anchored to the most recent regime while relying on promised lead time for arrivals; large in-transit stock reduces need for aggressive ordering.

Promised lead time = 2; recent concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period arrivals recently, and a large in-transit stock exists, so use promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods to capture the new lower-demand regime and reduced volatility, enabling the OR engine to size replenishment conservatively given high pipeline inventory.

Historical concluded lead times vary (mostly 1\u20132 periods); using calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has shown multiple earlier regime shifts; no new sustained shift in the last 5 concludes, so use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend applies the full-sample estimate adjusted for the inferred lead time. This balances service level (use observed lead-time average) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume.

On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1144 covers multiple weeks; promised lead time remains credible (historical concludes show many 2-period arrivals). To avoid overstock given high pipeline and lower recent demand, use L=default (promised=2) and set mu_hat/sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods to capture the new lower regime. This keeps base-stock responsive to the downward demand shift while the backend cap will limit excessive single-period orders given the large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=1144 which already covers multiple review+lead periods (with promised L=2, (1+L)=3 \u2192 3\xd7mean_last5 \u2248 368). Historical conclude messages show mixed lead times but no strong new evidence to revise promised lead time; many past arrivals align with L=2. I choose L=default (use promised 2), set mu_hat using recent 5 periods to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, and set sigma_hat using recent 5 periods to reflect current volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock to avoid excess ending inventory given the large in-transit position while preserving service for the lower recent demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Periods 26-36 (week demands ~102,120,158,140,145,141,135,147,106,85,84) \u2014 sustained decline vs earlier high-demand regime. In-transit is large (1144) and will cover multiple future periods; promised lead time is 2 and recent concluded arrivals support L=2 overall. I select L=default (use promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent stable low-demand window (Periods 32-36) to avoid over-ordering given the large pipeline. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to estimate volatility from the same recent window so the OR backend sizes safety stock to current variability. This configuration balances service (using recent lower mean) against holding cost given the large in-transit volume and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has declined and settled in a lower regime (recent weekly demands \u2248 85\u2013147). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1144 covers multiple weeks; promised lead time=2. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (no new sustained lead-time evidence since Period 31). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the latest low-demand regime (Periods 33\u201337: 147,106,85,84,109 \u2192 mean \u2248106) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Sigma_hat use default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overfitting variance with few recent points. These settings bias orders down to match the sustained lower demand while letting the OR engine respect the pipeline stock and holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=1144 (large pipeline). Recent demand has fallen markedly: last 5 concluded periods (P34-38) mean \u224892.4 units/week. No new concluded arrivals since P33\u2013P38, but per instructions infer lead time only from concluded messages. I therefore keep L at the promised/default value (2). To capture the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on P34-38). This biases orders down to avoid holding cost while the large in-transit pipeline provides coverage against stockouts.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been low (Periods 35-39: 85,84,109,78,61) reflecting a sustained downshift since around Period 26\u201331; seasonally late-year demand is weak for this basic T-shirt. On-hand=0, in-transit=1144 (large pipeline). Past concluded arrivals support the promised lead time=2 in prior windows, so use promised lead time. Set L=default to keep backend expectation at 2. Use recent demand to avoid overstocking: mu_hat recent_N N=5 (captures latest low-demand regime, (1+L)-period demand forecast based on last 5 weeks). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent lower volatility. This reduces ordering given heavy in-transit inventory and high holding cost relative to profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 31 (weekly demand ~135\u2192down to 61\u2013145 recently). On-hand=0, in-transit=1144 (large pipeline) \u2014 no new concluded arrivals in recent weeks, so treat promised lead time as default (2) but rely on recent demand for forecasting. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (backend expects 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 31\u201340) so the base-stock and cap reflect reduced demand and avoid excess holding given high pipeline. This balances service level against holding cost given the large in-transit position and sustained lower demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent observed weekly demand has declined vs earlier 2019: however the canonical historical samples provided (5 weekly samples from Jan 2019; mean=204.8) seed the forecast. On-hand=0, in-transit=1144 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple (1+L) periods, so no aggressive uplift needed. Lead time has been previously confirmed as 2 periods in history; I therefore use default lead time (promised). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat leverages the full-sample estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies its base-stock and cap formulas while respecting the proven promised lead time and current large in-transit balance. No new sustained demand or lead-time pattern meets the 3+ period/significant threshold, so no carry-over update.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=1144. Recent concluded history shows multi-period lower weekly demand (Periods 22\u201342 mostly 60\u2013160 range) and no new sustained lead-time evidence beyond previously recorded insights. To avoid overreacting to short noise and because promised lead time remains credible, use default lead time (promised L=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging the full history while the large in-transit position will cap orders via the OR cap and prevent over-ordering.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has fallen materially vs earlier regimes; last 5 demands (Periods 39-43) = [61,69,67,109,61], mean \u224873.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=1144 (large pipeline) and prior concluded lead-time evidence supports promised lead time=2. I set L=default to keep the OR engine using the contractual 2-period promise (recent concluded arrivals have shown 1\u20132 but overall confirmed 2 earlier). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (keeps base_stock small to avoid holding cost given large in-transit). For sigma I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce orders while pipeline clears, balancing service level (short-term coverage) against holding cost exposure from the large in-transit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1144 but no concluded arrivals in recent periods \u2192 evidence of delayed/lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 40-44) = [69,67,109,61,55], recent mean \u224872.2. To be conservative versus promised lead time=2, set L explicitly to 3 to cover observed delays. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility around the lower mean. These choices prioritize avoiding excess holding of potentially stranded in-transit stock while restoring service for current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Possible missing/delayed shipments: 1144 units currently in-transit with no concluded arrivals for multiple periods (sustained delay observed).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=1144 with many periods of no concluded arrivals \u2192 persistent delayed/possible lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 41-45) = [67,109,61,55,64], recent mean \u224871.2. Because in-transit stock is large but arrivals have been delayed, I explicitly increase assumed lead time to 3 to be conservative against further delays. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current low-demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 5 samples). This keeps forecasted replenishment tuned to current low demand while the longer L guards against ordering on top of delayed in-transit stock.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). Large in-transit balance (1144) with no concluded arrivals for many periods suggests shipments may be delayed or effectively longer than promised. Historical concluded lead times have been 1\u20132 but recent prolonged absence of arrivals supports using a longer lead-time estimate to avoid stockouts when those in-transit units eventually conclude. Demand in the last 5 periods is low and stable (Periods 42\u201346), so I use a recent-5 demand estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime while setting L explicitly to 3 to cover potential extended delays. This biases orders upward to protect service if the pipeline is slower, while recent_N demand/volatility limits overreaction to very old high-demand samples.
