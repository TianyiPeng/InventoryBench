{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference & pipeline reliability: historical concluded messages confirm variable lead times (1\u20133) and prior lost shipments; recent carry-over insight flags in-transit=1700 as unreliable until shipments conclude. Therefore I will NOT rely on the 1,700 in-transit units for immediate coverage. Demand & seasonality: item is a basic men's T-shirt near 2019-12-23 (holiday shopping window) and recent weekly demand shows volatility but a near-term uptick (Periods 43\u201345 sold 46,49,107; Period 42=150). A conservative short-term demand estimate is ~65\u201375 units/week. Decision horizon & safety: promised lead time L=2 implies we must cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand at decision time (current period demand occurs after ordering). Target coverage = 3 \xd7 75 = 225 units. Current on-hand = 20, treating in-transit as unreliable \u2192 order_raw \u2248 205. Given holding cost is low ($1) and profit high ($19), I round to a clean practical order of 200 units to cover most of the 3-week exposure while limiting excess if some in-transit concludes. This adjusts OR's recommendation (0) upward due to unreliable pipeline and holiday/upward demand signals.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Ignored OR's 0 because in-transit (1700) is unreliable; order 200 to cover ~3 weeks (~225) of expected demand minus 20 on-hand, balancing upside from $19 profit vs low $1 holding cost.",

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 periods (multiple P\u2192P+2 arrivals). Pipeline reliability: prior carry-over flagged lost shipments and advised treating in-transit as unreliable until concluded; current in-transit=1900 should not be trusted for immediate availability. Demand outlook: recent realized weekly demand (Periods 42\u201346) = {150,46,49,107,84}, avg \u2248 87 units/week; earlier high-demand regime exists but recent 5-week average is a better short-term anchor. Service policy: promised lead time L=2, so we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand between ordering and when arrivals are usable. Target cover = 3 \xd7 87 \u2248 261 units. Holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 high critical fractile), so err on the side of stocking to avoid lost sales. OR recommended 0 likely because it counted pipeline; I override that due to unreliable in-transit. Final order = 260 units (rounded), providing cover for ~3 periods of expected demand while limiting inventory risk.",
