Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand (5 samples) averages ~26.2 units/week with no observed concluded arrivals and on-hand/in-transit = 0. No evidence of lead-time shifts or sustained demand regime change; use promised lead time and default demand estimators to let OR engine compute base-stock given historical mean/variance and cost ratio (profit $4, holding $1). This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively before any confirmed changepoint.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demands (Jan\u2013Feb) show rising sales: samples = [0,24,29,37,41], mean=26.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=53 (ordered Period 1, no arrivals concluded yet). No concluded lead-time evidence (no arrivals observed), so retain promised lead time. Use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the OR engine aligned with historical baseline while accounting for the 2-period promise and the current pipeline of 53 units.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded history shows two placed orders (Periods 1\u20132) have not yet concluded/arrived; in-transit=106. Promised lead time is 2 but actual lead time cannot be inferred because no concluded arrivals exist yet. Demand history samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~26.2 units/week; with promised L=2 the default (1+L) scaling gives a multi-period demand forecast ~78.6. Because there is insufficient concluded evidence to change lead time or detect a sustained demand regime shift, I keep L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat as defaults so the OR backend uses promised lead time and full-sample statistics. This also avoids overreacting to potentially delayed (not confirmed lost) shipments while the in-transit stock (106) already exceeds the default multi-period demand forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed demand (Periods 1-3 conclude) = [37,58,51], average \u224848.7 over 3 periods, substantially above the earlier sample mean (\u224826.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=123, and three recent placed orders have not concluded (arrived=0) suggesting delayed/lost shipments but no confirmed alternate lead time yet. I keep L at promised (default) because no concluded arrivals give a different lead-time estimate. To respond to a sustained demand regime shift I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (captures the recent high-demand regime over the last 3 periods). This increases the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility used by the OR engine to raise the base stock and reduce stockouts while accepting higher holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: recent avg (Periods1-3) = 48.7 vs earlier sample mean = 26.2 (+86%); sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demand has shifted up and remained high (Periods 1-4 demands = 37,58,51,57; recent avg=50.8 vs earlier historical mean ~26). On-hand=0, in-transit=109 (pipeline heavy). Conclude in Period 4 confirmed actual lead time = 2 (matched promised). To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (N=4 covering the recent elevated periods) and keep promised lead time (default). Sigma uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent variability. These choices bias the OR base-stock up to meet sustained higher demand while the large in-transit reduces additional ordering pressure.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has risen sharply and sustained since Period 3 (period demands: P3=51, P4=57, P5=44) vs earlier historical mean ~26. On-hand=0, in-transit=167 (covers several future periods). One concluded arrival shows orders from P2 arrived in P4 with lead_time=2, so no evidence to override promised lead time. To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand (N=3 covering P3-P5) so mu_hat reflects the new higher mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. L kept default (promised=2) because concluded arrival confirms promised lead time. These choices increase target base-stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has been elevated and variable: Periods1-6 demands = [37,58,51,57,44,58] (recent avg ~50.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=109 (sufficient pipeline but arrivals have shown inconsistent lead times: observed lead times = {2,1}). I set L=calculate to have the backend use the average observed lead time. Given the sustained higher-demand regime (carry-over insight) I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent periods and improve responsiveness to the regime shift while the capped order cap limits extreme orders. This balances higher service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost via the OR engine's z* tradeoff.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent demand is elevated (~50\u201358/week); on-hand=0, in-transit=170. Observed concluded lead times: P4 shows order from P2 arrived (LT=2), P6 shows order from P5 arrived (LT=1) => recent lead times = [2,1]. I choose L with recent_N=2 to let the backend average recent observed LT (captures LT drift). Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime (sustained recent weeks ~52 avg); use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent five demand observations. Volatility should reflect recent variation, so use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat. These settings prioritize service (higher mu_hat over full-history mean) while using recent LT to avoid under/over-ordering given mixed arrivals; existing in-transit (170) should cover several periods but backend will reconcile pipeline vs. base stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 3 (sustained regime); on-hand=1, in-transit=109. Observed concluded lead times: Period4->2, Period6->1, Period8->1 \u2192 use recent average to reflect drift vs promised 2. Set L by averaging last 3 observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N based on the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods3-8 length=6) to capture the new mean and variability. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6) increases supply to match the higher demand while avoiding overstating long-run variability; this balances service (profit) vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 3 (sustained regime); recent 7-period mean used for forecasting. Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P8:1} => recent average ~1.33, so I set L using the last 3 observed lead times to reflect this mix of 1\u20132 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=171 provides coverage but some prior arrivals were delayed; using recent_N demand (N=7) captures the sustained higher-demand regime while recent_N volatility (N=7) captures current variation. These parameters raise target base-stock to favor service (profit > holding cost) while acknowledging in-transit inventory to avoid over-ordering.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=39, in-transit=109. Recent arrivals show actual lead times = [2,1,1,1] (avg\u22481.25) but most recent 3 are 1; no lost shipments observed. Demand history (P3 onward) shows a higher regime vs earlier periods and has persisted (changepoint at P3). I set L using recent observed lead times with N=4 to capture the small residual 2-period outlier while weighting recent 1-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 3\u201310) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Sigma uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (capture elevated recent mean) versus holding cost by using a limited recent window and a lead-time estimate that de-emphasizes a single 2-period outlier.

Demand regime shift detected at Period 3 (carry-over) with sustained higher demand; recent demand stays elevated. To reflect the modest reduction in realized lead-time versus promised and to capture the sustained higher demand, I set L via recent observed lead times and set demand estimates using recent samples covering the new regime. These parameters aim to raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while capping orders via the OR cap to limit overstock and holding cost exposure.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Observed concluded lead times: recent arrivals show mostly 1-period (Periods 6,8,10 were lead_time=1; Period4 was 2). I set L using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent stable lead-time behavior (avg \u22481). Demand has varied: earlier historical mean ~26.2 but more recent weeks show higher/volatile demand; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest 5 demand observations (Periods 8\u201312 mean \u224836.4) and scale by (1+L) in the backend. This keeps pipeline targets responsive to the recent demand regime while avoiding overreaction to single weeks; it also accounts for the sizable in-transit inventory so the OR engine can cap orders appropriately.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-13. On-hand=0, in-transit=139 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,1,1,2] (Periods 4,6,8,10,13). Recent demand (Periods 9-13): [39,23,34,26,32] -> recent mean \u2248 30.8, higher than earlier full-sample mean; prior carry-over noted a sustained regime shift. To reflect the mixed but mostly 1\u20132 period observed lead times while weighting recent behavior, I set L using recent_N over the last 5 observed lead times. To capture the higher recent demand regime and reduce stockouts, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 5 demand samples (captures current mean/volatility while limiting influence of older low-demand samples). This balances service (protect against stockouts given large in-transit and recent higher demand) with holding cost by using recent volatility for safety stock rather than inflating with full-sample variance.

Recent demand has been elevated and more volatile (last 5 demands: 23,34,26,32,73) so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current high-mean, high-variance regime. This raises the backend base-stock to protect service given several 1\u20132 period lead times and recent demand spikes while the large in-transit position will limit actual orders via the cap.

Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 3 (noted earlier) \u2014 recent weekly demands are elevated (e.g., Periods10-15: 23,34,26,32,73,67). To balance service vs holding cost: set L to a short recent average to reflect faster arrivals seen recently, and use recent_N demand estimates (N=6) to capture the current elevated mean and volatility over the most recent 6 weeks.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime noted earlier (sustained higher demands since Period 3); current on-hand=0, in-transit=160. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,1,2,2} \u2192 average \u22481.5; I use calculated average lead time to let backend reflect realized variability. For demand I emphasize the recent high-demand regime (last 6 concluded demand observations: Periods 11-16 avg \u224847.3) so set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6). Volatility also uses the same recent window (recent_N N=6) to capture current variance. These choices push the base-stock toward higher coverage to avoid lost sales given large in-transit but zero on-hand, while letting the OR cap limit excessive ordering to control holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=120 (some arrivals recently concluded show mixed 1\u20132 period lead times). Recent demand has been higher and more volatile (several weeks 50\u201392 units). Use calculated average lead time from observed conclues to capture mixed 1\u20132 lead times, and use recent_N (last 8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the newer, higher-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend raises target stock while limiting excess holding.

On-hand=0, in-transit=187 (covers upcoming demand partially but shipments have shown variable lead times 1\u20132). I set L using calculate to use the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=16 to base mu_hat on the recent high-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 16 samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=16 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to avoid lost sales during the sustained higher demand while using recent volatility to limit excess holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 20 (2019-06-24). Demand has been elevated and volatile since Period 3 (carry-over previously recorded). On-hand=0, in-transit=124 (useful pipeline). Observed lead times vary between 1-2; to be robust use average lead time from observations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent regime data (post-changepoint) to reflect the sustained higher demand; choose N equal to the recent regime length (17 periods) to capture current mean/variance. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost by relying on recent demand estimates and averaged lead time.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 and that elevated demand is sustained through recent periods (multiple 50\u2013110 demands); use recent_N to capture the recent high-demand regime. Chose N=18 to cover the post-changepoint regime length (Periods 3\u201320) while respecting caps. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine target service given current higher mean and volatility while L=default avoids overreacting to noisy lead-time variation.

On-hand=0, in-transit=207 \u2014 large pipeline but many prior orders concluded with variable lead times (observed lead times = mix of 1\u20132 periods); some recent periods show arrivals delayed/absent but not yet confirmed lost. To balance service vs holding cost I use recent data to capture the higher-demand regime and recent lead-time behavior: L as recent_N (uses recent observed lead times), mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent_N (N=5) to focus forecasts on the last 5 weeks of realized demand and variability so the OR engine sizes replenishment for the elevated regime while capping orders via its internal cap to limit exposure given pipeline uncertainty.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=16, in-transit=201. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (observed sequence avg=1.5) and recent demand elevated/volatile (last 6 demands: P17-P22 = 92,92,111,46,72,67). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=$4, holding=$1 \u2192 q=0.8 high service target) I set L to the average observed lead time (captures mixed 1\u20132 behavior). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent higher regime while limiting influence of older low-demand samples. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the sustained demand uplift while not overreacting to single spikes; large in-transit quantity reduces aggressive ordering risk.

I select recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 17\u201323) so the base-stock reflects current high demand while sigma captures recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=291. Historical concluded lead times alternate between 1 and 2 periods (multiple observations); I use the calculated average lead time to capture that variability. Recent demand is volatile with a large spike in Period 23 but no new sustained regime change since the previously recorded shift; therefore I set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 periods to make the base-stock reflect current demand mix. These parameters help the OR engine size orders to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while accounting for recent variance and the large in-transit balance to avoid excessive additional ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand 0 + in-transit 291 \u2014 large pipeline but recent concluded messages show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2 periods) and some late/no arrivals after Period 24; demand has been elevated recently (recent 5-period demands average ~76 units/week). To balance service vs holding cost I (1) estimate lead time from recent observed lead-times to reflect the 1\u20132 period mix, (2) forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the recent higher regime, and (3) set volatility from the same recent window. These choices aim to keep base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand while respecting the sizable pipeline so we avoid excessive new orders.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. On-hand=0, in-transit=234. Recent concluded lead times vary (1-3 periods) with a single 3-period observation (Period 26), so I use a short recent average to capture current variability without overreacting to a single 3. Demand has been elevated recently (several weeks of high sales including 114 and 116), so I base demand forecast and volatility on the last 5 weeks to reflect the current regime. Methods chosen: recent_N for L to adapt to recent lead-time shifts; recent_N for mu_hat to capture elevated recent demand; recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. The large in-transit volume plus recent high demand argues for moderate target base-stock computed from recent demand and lead-time estimates while avoiding over-ordering if some shipments are delayed or lost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): on-hand=0, in-transit=297. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (recent observed lead_times: 2,1,3) with a recent 3-period arrival (ordered P23 arrived P26). Demand has shifted higher and remains elevated (recent 5-week demands = [114,55,73,116,173], mean=106.2). To capture current lead-time variability use recent lead-time average; to capture the sustained higher demand use recent demand statistics over the last 5 periods. These settings increase the backend base-stock to raise service while capping orders via the engine's cap to limit excess holding given holding cost $1 and profit $4.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=386 (covers some upcoming demand but arrival timing variable). Observed actual lead times in concluded messages have been variable (recent observations include 1,2,1,3), so I set L using recent lead-time observations to capture recent variability. For demand I use a recent-window estimate (N=10) to capture the sustained high-demand regime and its volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting elevated demand while reflecting recent lead-time uncertainty.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2. Recent demand has surged (Periods 27-29: 173,194,150) and several late/missing arrivals imply lead-times have stretched recently (Period 26 concluded an arrival with lead_time=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=386 (pipeline significant but arrivals uncertain). I set L explicit=3 to hedge against observed longer lead times and delayed shipments. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current high-demand regime (captures the three most recent high weeks). These parameters raise the (1+L) forecast and variability used by the OR engine, increasing orders to protect service while recognizing higher holding cost via the capped order rule.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent demand has jumped sharply since Period 27 (P27-30 demands: 173,194,150,195) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=443. Several arrivals in recent concludes showed lead times of 2\u20133 periods (e.g., P27\u2192P30 lead_time=3, P28\u2192P30 lead_time=2), so I use a recent-average lead time to capture variability. I treat demand using a recent-N forecast anchored on the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 27\u201330) so base_stock reflects the new mean; volatility also estimated from the same recent window to raise safety stock appropriately. These choices aim to keep service during the new high-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity reduces urgent ordering risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: avg(P27-30)=178 vs prior 4-period avg(P23-26)=89.5 (+99%); sustained 4 periods

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has a confirmed upward regime starting Period 27 (avg P27-30 = 178 vs prior ~90). On-hand=0, in-transit=565 (large pipeline but arrivals subject to varying lead times). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed lead times \u22481.71. I set L=calculate to let backend use the empirical average lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 27\u201331) to capture the new higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the elevated demand while avoiding overstating long-term variance given the clear recent shift and the substantial in-transit pipeline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand has clearly shifted upward starting Period 27 (avg P27-30 \u2248178 vs prior \u224889.5) and this high-demand regime persisted through Period 32 (sales large, ending on-hand now 183 with 234 in-transit). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133 periods) so use a data-driven average. Set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time. For demand, use recent_N with N=4 to capture the confirmed regime from Periods 27\u201330 (regime length=4) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean across (1+L) review+lead horizon. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility in the new regime. These choices keep safety stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while L=calculate accounts for variable realized lead times and helps avoid under-ordering if lead times have lengthened.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand is in a higher regime (sustained high weekly sell-through since Period 27; recent demands: P27-33 range 150-219) and pipeline is large (in-transit=336, on-hand=0). Observed concluded lead times have risen recently (several 3-period observations around P26\u2013P30). To capture the recent longer lead-time behavior I average the most recent observed lead-times (recent_N=5). To forecast demand I use a recent-window that covers the confirmed high-demand regime (regime length P27\u2013P33 \u2248 7 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=7. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the elevated demand while accounting for increased lead-time uncertainty.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=557 \u2014 substantial pipeline but recent arrivals show variable lead times (observed lead_times in conclude history: 1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,3,3,2,2,1). Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period 27 (sustained higher weekly demand ~150-195+). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent-sample forecasts for demand mean and volatility. For lead time I use a recent average of observed lead times to reflect the mixed but slightly >1 average seen recently. These choices make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the sustained demand increase (raising base stock to meet service) while L recent_N captures lead-time variability so the OR backend sizes orders to cover (1+L) periods of demand without overreacting to older low-demand data.

To reflect persistent higher demand I use a recent-window demand estimate while using a recent average lead time to capture the observed variability. L: average of last 5 observed lead times to be responsive to recent 1-3 period variability. mu_hat & sigma_hat: recent_N over the last 9 demand samples (captures the new high-demand regime length ~9 periods) so the OR backend will raise base-stock to meet higher (L+1)-period demand while sigma_hat from the same window captures increased volatility; this balances higher service level against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Carry-over insight: Lead-time variability confirmed: observed lead_times include 1, 2 and 3 periods across multiple concluded arrivals (examples: P4 arrival shows LT=2; P6/P8/P10 show LT=1; P26 and P30 show LT=3), indicating inconsistent lead times and occasional delays.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift since Period 27 with elevated weekly demand and lead-time variability (observed LT samples include 1,2,3). On-hand=35 and in-transit=455 provide healthy pipeline cover vs. recent demand. I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures the mixed 1\u20133 period behaviour). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to focus the forecast on the last 6 demand observations (periods 31\u201336) which reflect the post-changepoint level while still including the recent decline; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher service (profit/holding implies high fill target) while using recent data to avoid overreaction to single-period spikes and to partially mitigate lost/delayed shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=455. Historical concluded arrivals show inconsistent lead times (mixture of 1\u20133) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 27 (much higher weekly demand since P27). Profit=$4, Holding=$1 \u21d2 high service target (q\u22480.8). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of all observed concluded lead times (captures observed 1\u20133 variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime from Period 27 onward (use last 11 demand samples to estimate mean/volatility across the review+lead period). These choices bias the base-stock upward to protect service during the new high-demand regime while letting the backend incorporate the calculated average lead time and observed recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical concludes show inconsistent lead times (1\u20133 periods) and a sustained demand uplift starting Period 27. To capture actual LT variability I ask backend to compute average observed lead time (method=calculate). For demand I use EWMA to emphasize recent weeks while smoothing noisy spikes (EWMA_gamma gamma=0.3). For volatility I use recent_N over the last 12 demand samples to reflect current variability. These choices balance service (capture recent higher demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133); average of observed concluded lead times ~1.72, so use calculated L to let backend infer typical LT. Demand exhibits a sustained high regime since Period 27 (avg P27-39 high); I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the current elevated demand (regime length 13 periods). Thus: L=calculate to reflect observed LT variability; mu_hat=recent_N with N=13 to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the recent high-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=13 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost given large in-transit volume (backend cap will limit order size).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been elevated but variable: last 9 concluded demands (P32-40) = [148,219,132,75,69,71,82,53,54], mean \u2248100.3. On-hand=0, in-transit=509 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133 periods) so I let backend compute the empirical average lead time. To reflect the recent demand regime rather than long-ago low samples, I use a recent_N forecast (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets service for the current elevated regime while the large in-transit inventory reduces new orders via the cap.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical concluded arrivals show inconsistent lead times (mix of 1,2,3) but most recent concluded Ls include 3,1,2,1,3,2 \u2014 I use a recent average to capture variability. Demand has shifted since late summer to a higher regime but recent weekly demand has moderated (recent 8 periods reflect current trend). To balance service (high profit/holding ratio q=0.8) against holding cost and overdue/in-transit risk, I use recent-window estimates for lead time, mean demand and volatility so the OR backend builds a base-stock reflecting the current regime while limiting over-ordering given many units already in transit.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=509. Historical concluded arrivals show inconsistent lead times (observed 1,2,3 periods) and several delayed shipments; therefore infer lead-time from observed history rather than blindly trusting promised LT=2. I select L via calculate to let the backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 39-42 = 53,54,46,75) is modest and appears a new short-run regime; use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand behavior. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to recent lower demand while the LT estimate accounts for the documented LT variability and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=509 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show variable lead times but already recorded in carry-over; recent demand (last 5 conclude periods: P39-43 = 53,54,46,75,20) has mean ~49.6. Promised lead time = 2; keep L as default to let OR use promised LT while pipeline is large. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and avoid dilution by older low/high spikes; this yields (1+L)\xd7recent_mean centering replenishment on current demand. Use default sigma_hat so OR uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This configuration prevents placing large new orders (pipeline already 509) while aligning target base-stock to recent demand and accounting for variability.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133) but no new concluded arrivals since Period 36, so use calculated average lead time from observed data. Recent demand has fallen from summer peak; use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the current lower-december regime (last 5 weeks). Use matching recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned to current lower demand while the calculated L accounts for observed lead-time variability and helps avoid underordering given large in-transit volume.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand (Periods 42-45) is low and stable (75,20,29,26) after earlier summer spikes; on-hand=0 but large in-transit=509 units (pipeline abundant). Historical concluded arrivals show inconsistent lead times (1\u20133). To avoid under/over-ordering I average recent observed lead times to capture variability, and base demand forecast on the most recent 4 weeks to reflect current low-December demand. Parameters therefore use recent_N for L (captures recent LT variability), recent_N for mu_hat using last 4 demand samples (captures current low regime), and recent_N for sigma_hat using last 4 samples (volatility around current regime). This keeps the OR backend's base-stock tied to the present low-demand regime while acknowledging lead-time inconsistency and large pipeline to avoid excess additional ordering.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, large in-transit=509. Historical concluded arrivals show inconsistent lead times (1\u20133 periods) so use observed-average lead time. Recent demand (Periods 43\u201346 = 20,29,26,27) is lower and appears a new stable low regime after earlier spikes; use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given large pipeline. These settings help the OR backend set base stock for current demand level while accounting for observed lead-time variability and high in-transit inventory to reduce holding costs and stockouts.
