Product (women's trousers) is seasonally relevant for holiday shopping. b) Demand regime: Recent periods show a sustained high-demand regime: Periods 42-45 demands = [182,98,154,133], 4-period avg \u2248142/wk; use ~140\u2013150 as short-term forecast. c) Lead time / pipeline: Promised lead time = 2, but historical concludes show actual lead_time has varied (observed 1\u20133) and earlier missing/delayed shipments were recorded; in-transit=600 may not all arrive on schedule. Treat pipeline as partially unreliable but not entirely lost. d) Inventory assessment: On-hand=0; in-transit=600 (uncertain). Current demand will occur after decision, and arrivals for any new order won't help until after the promised lead time. e) Order logic: To avoid costly stockouts during a holiday spike (profit $19/unit >> holding $1/unit/period), target coverage for L+1=3 weeks of demand plus modest safety stock. Forecast 140/week \u2192 3*140=420; add small safety buffer for variability \u2192 450. This balances lost-sales risk (high profit) against modest holding cost.",
