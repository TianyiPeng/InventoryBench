Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand shows a clear downward regime beginning 2019-01-21 (three consecutive lower observations). No concluded arrivals to infer lead time, so keep promised lead time. To avoid overstocking after the sustained drop, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (last 3 weeks) so the backend's (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the lower demand; recent_N N=3 chosen because the detected regime length is 3 periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior avg (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14)=248.5 vs recent avg (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04)=101.67 (\u221259%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent demand regime (starting 2019-01-21) is lower: recent 3-week avg (~101.7) vs prior ~248.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=132 (order placed Period 1 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time unknown \u2014 use promised lead time. To reflect the lower recent demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (N=3 samples). L kept as default (promised=2) so OR engine plans for (1+L) review+lead coverage. This reduces target base-stock compared with using all-history mean, lowering overstock risk given holding cost $1 and modest profit $19.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent historical demand shows a sustained downshift starting 2019-01-21 (recent 3-sample mean=101.67 vs earlier mean\u2248248.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=253; promised L=2 implies we should cover (1+L)=3 periods of demand. I do NOT infer a confirmed lead-time change because no arrivals have been observed yet (concludes show arrived=0 but no positive arrival evidence). To reflect the lower demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend computes a base stock aligned to the new lower demand; L left as default (promised) to avoid prematurely extending lead time given lack of arrival evidence. This balances service (avoid overstock from prior high-demand estimate) vs holding cost given a clear ~60% demand drop.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand regime has been lower since 2019-01-21 (prior avg ~248.5 -> recent lower values). On-hand=0, in-transit=299 but no concluded arrivals in history (orders from P1\u2013P3 never concluded) suggesting shipments are delayed/lost; be conservative on lead time. Set L explicit=3 to buffer against further delays. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 6 demand observations (the low-demand regime: 112,112,81 plus recent period demands 82,102,89) so the OR backend targets lower base_stock and reduces holding cost while maintaining service.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1199.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent realized weekly demand has been low (Period1-4 demands = 82,102,89,66) consistent with the previously identified downshift starting 2019-01-21. One concluded arrival shows an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2); an earlier Period 1 order never concluded (likely lost). To reflect confirmed lead time of 2 and the recent lower-demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times, and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 4 periods to capture the current low-demand regime and reduce overstock risk while maintaining service. These parameters help the OR backend size base stock for a 3-period review+lead window and cap orders to limit holding cost given low demand and existing large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized weekly demand has declined vs earlier samples (last 5 demands: 82,102,89,66,52 \u2192 mean 78.2), and existing inventory is low on-hand (3) but large pipeline (298) from prior orders. Lead time was confirmed as 2 in history and matches promise, so keep promised lead time. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use a recent_N demand forecast over the last 5 periods (captures the downward trend) and match sigma to the same window so variability reflects recent weeks. These parameters make the OR engine target a base stock appropriate for the current low-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity will limit new ordering and reduce holding cost exposure.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent realized weekly demand has fallen sharply vs early-Jan (historical mean 160.4) \u2014 carry-over noted a regime shift starting 2019-01-21; recent realized demands (Periods 4\u20136: 66, 52, 48) confirm a lower demand regime. On-hand=0 but In-transit=298 (large pipeline that has not yet concluded in visible history); no new concluded arrivals since Period 4, so some past orders may still be in-transit or lost \u2014 I remain conservative on lead time and use promised lead time. I set L to default (promised=2). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, using N=6 (captures samples from the post-changepoint regime: historical samples 2019-01-21 onward plus recent periods). This reduces target base-stock to match lower demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost $1 and unit profit $19. Using recent_N for sigma captures the lower observed variability and tightens safety stock.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent average \u2248101.7 vs prior \u2248248.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=298 (large pipeline). Lead-time evidence from Period 4 conclude confirms actual lead time = 2 (matches promised). To align the forecast with the lower recent regime while keeping the OR engine's lead-time assumption, I set L to default (use promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (the recent regime consists of the last 3 samples: 112,112,81) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and reduces overstock risk given the large in-transit. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias replenishment toward the new, lower-demand regime and avoid ordering into the large in-transit position while preserving service-level tradeoffs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent observed demand (concluded periods) shows post-Jan21 lower regime but the last 5 concluded demands (P4\u2013P8 = 66,52,48,83,90) indicate a stable mid-range. On-hand=0, in-transit=298 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals are not yet concluded; do not assume lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) since lead time=2 was previously confirmed and no new lead-time evidence. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 concluded demand samples to capture the current realized demand regime while avoiding bias from earlier high-demand samples. This balances service (use recent demand to size base stock) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand regime is lower than early-Jan levels (carry-over noted). On-hand=0, in-transit=298 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals may be delayed/lumpy. Lead time confirmed previously as 2 periods (use historical observed LT average to remain conservative), so set L by calculation. Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 9 demand observations (captures the post-changepoint lower demand and recent weekly variability) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to service near-term demand without excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand regime is the lower regime starting 2019-01-21 (prior avg 248.5 -> recent avg 101.67 over 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=298 (covers some past orders; no new concluded arrivals since Period 4). Lead time observed = 2 periods (Period 4 conclude showed P2 order arrived with lead_time=2). I set L by calculate to use observed lead-time average (confirmed 2). For demand I target the lower recent regime: use recent_N (N=3) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of the most recent regime samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of those samples\u2014this reduces forecast to match the sustained drop and avoids overstock given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=298 (large pipeline but not yet visible in concluded arrivals). Historical demand shows a sustained lower regime since 2019-01-21 (weekly demands generally ~30\u201390 vs earlier ~240). Lead time has been confirmed previously as 2 periods; I use the promised/default L to keep backend assumptions aligned. To reflect the recent low-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 11 demand observations so the forecast and uncertainty reflect the current lower-volume pattern and reduce excessive overstocking vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has been low since the regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (recent mean \u2248101.67 vs prior \u2248248.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=298 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=2. To avoid overreacting to delayed/lost-order risk while honoring the confirmed lead time and the sustained lower-demand regime, I keep the backend defaults: use promised lead time (default) and population-based demand moments so the OR engine computes base-stock from all samples. This leverages the confirmed LT=2, the full-sample mean/variance (conservative given sizable pipeline), and avoids increasing orders that would raise holding costs given high in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=461 (large pipeline). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 4 showed P2 order arrival). Demand has been in the lower regime since 2019-01-21. To reflect confirmed LT=2 I set L by calculation from observed lead times. To anchor forecasts to the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N with N=9 (captures the most recent 9 demand periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; this reduces service-level overshoot given large in-transit and higher holding cost sensitivity (profit=$19, holding=$1).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=461 with several past orders failing to conclude (possible lost shipments); only confirmed observed lead time is 2 (Period 2\u21924). Demand has been lower since the Jan-21 regime shift; to be responsive I use a lead-time estimate from observed history and focus mu/sigma on recent demand to reflect the lower regime and reduce overstock/holding. L chosen by calculation (avg observed lead times =2). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=12 (covering the last 12 demand samples) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect current lower-demand regime and limit excess ordering given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=461 (large pipeline; several past orders not yet concluded => possible delayed/lost arrivals). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained low weekly demand ~20-90). Promised lead time=2 and earlier conclusion confirmed actual lead time=2. To prioritize service while avoiding excess holding given low recent demand, set L to default (use promised=2). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent low-demand regime; choose N=10 to capture recent 10 periods (sufficient to cover the sustained regime and smooth week-to-week noise). This reduces target base-stock versus using older high-demand samples and lowers holding cost exposure given large in-transit. Parameters balance service (use recent volatility) against holding cost (shrink mean forecast).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical data shows a sustained lower-demand regime since 2019-01-21 (recorded) and lead time confirmed at 2 periods; promised lead time remains 2. In-transit stock (461) already covers multiple (1+L) periods of expected demand, so avoid inflating orders. I use L=default (promised 2). For demand I focus on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=10 to compute mu_hat ( (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 demands ) and sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to capture recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock aligned to the lower recent demand and reduces holding risk while preserving service level given the substantial in-transit pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 13\u201318 demand = 23,28,30,19,26,27; recent mean \u224825.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=461 (sizable pipeline). Historical conclude messages confirm lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived Period 4). I set L to calculate so backend uses observed lead times. To reflect the recent low-demand regime and avoid overstock given large in-transit, I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent 6 periods: P13\u2013P18). This keeps (1+L)-period forecast aligned with current lower demand and reduces safety stock compared to using older high-demand samples, balancing service level against holding cost with a conservative replenishment posture given the large pipeline.

Previous carry-over confirmed lead time=2; no new sustained lead-time evidence. I keep L=default (promised=2) and set demand estimates using recent_N over the last 7 post-regime samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid inflating orders despite large in-transit volume. This balances service (cover 3 periods of demand) against holding cost given high pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=461 units. Historical demand samples (seed) show a lower recent regime since 2019-01-21; lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods. Many past orders have delayed/absent concludes but Period 4 evidence supports L=2. I choose default lead time so OR uses the promised 2. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine combine long-run demand stats with its service-level cap. This is conservative given large in-transit stock (461) that roughly matches multi-period demand; default methods avoid overreacting to intermittent missing-conclude events.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Several later orders (notably Period13 order of 163) never concluded and likely lost; pipeline figure includes undelivered/in-transit units so I keep the backend's lead-time estimator (calculate) to reflect observed arrivals. Demand has been in a lower regime since 2019-01-21 (carry-over) and recent weeks (Periods 10\u201321) show consistently low/less volatile demand, so I use recent_N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the latest regime. These choices reduce overstating demand (avoiding excess holding) while respecting confirmed lead time; they also let the OR engine cap orders relative to its estimated uncertainty given possible lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipment: order placed Period 13 (163 units) has not arrived by Period 21 (should have arrived by Period 15) \u2014 suggests lost/delayed shipment

A sustained demand regime shift was identified starting 2019-01-21 (recent mean much lower). To reflect confirmed lead time evidence, set L by calculating observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent data to capture the lower regime; cap N at 20 for stability. Use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=20) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demands, balancing service level against holding cost given low holding cost and modest profit.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been much lower since the regime shift noted in Jan 2019; last several weeks show ~10\u201330 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=461 (includes earlier long-delayed shipments). One shipment (P13) remains overdue, so treat pipeline cautiously. Set L by calculating observed lead times (use historical concluded arrivals) to respect confirmed L=2 evidence. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=10) to focus mu_hat and sigma_hat on the low recent regime (gives (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility over the latest 10 demand samples). This reduces overstock risk vs. using all-sample mean while preserving service given substantial in-transit inventory. No explicit numeric 'value' fields provided so backend will compute final base_stock and cap.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent observed demand has been in the lower regime since 2019-01-21 (user carry-over noted ~101.7 avg vs prior ~248.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=461 (includes older undelivered orders; no new concludes since P24 so possible lost shipments remain unresolved). Keep promised lead time (2) because lead time was previously confirmed and no new conclude evidence to change it. Use recent demand (N=20) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower-demand regime and recent seasonality through July; N=20 balances recency with sample size and caps at the policy guidance. This reduces overstock risk given holding cost $1 vs profit $19 and large in-transit volume.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weekly demand has been much lower since the regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (sustained lower means through Periods 3\u201325). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 461 (includes prior large shipments; some earlier orders were delayed but no new concluded lead-time change is confirmed). To avoid overstock while covering (1+L) periods of the current lower-demand regime, use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent regime data. Selected L=default to trust promised 2-period lead time (no new confirmed lead-time change in concluded messages). Selected mu_hat=recent_N (N=20) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=20) to focus the forecast on the most recent sustained low-demand regime (N chosen as capped recent regime length), which reduces target base-stock and limits holding costs while maintaining service for recent demand patterns.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent weekly demand has been at the lower post-change regime (sustained low single- to low-double-digit sales since 2019-01-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=461 but history includes missing/delayed shipments (not all in-transit may arrive). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (confirmed earlier as 2 periods). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the sustained low-demand regime (reduces overstock risk vs. using long-run mean). This favors lower base-stock and tighter cap, preserving profit while limiting holding cost given uncertain deliveries.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=461. Historical concluded messages confirm lead time=2 previously and one long-missing shipment (Period 13 order) but current pipeline is large (461) so we expect inventory arriving under the promised cadence. Recent demand regime (post-2019-01-21) is materially lower than the earliest two samples; to reflect the sustained lower demand I use recent data for demand mean and volatility. I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded history supports L=2 and lost shipments are isolated. Using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the forecast on the current low-demand regime and helps the OR backend set a conservative base-stock to balance $19 profit vs $1 holding cost given substantial pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=461 (includes older orders; Period 13 order missing long-run). Observed concluded lead times average 2 (one confirmed arrival with lead_time=2), so set L=calculate to let backend use observed average. Recent demand has increased (last 8 periods include a large spike of 167), so use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current demand regime and volatility; this balances service level for the recent uptick while avoiding overcommitment given possible lost shipments and holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has jumped sharply in Periods 27-29 (69, 167, 189) versus the prior weeks (Periods 20-26 avg ~14.57). On-hand=0, in-transit=461; there are known missing/delayed shipments from earlier periods. To respond to the new high-demand regime while acknowledging observed lead-time evidence, I set L via observed lead times (calculate). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to force the OR backend to target inventory for the new high-demand regime (short window forecast), and use recent_N for sigma to reflect the higher volatility in the last 3 weeks. This balances higher service-level needs versus holding cost by focusing forecast on the current spike rather than long-run low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: avg increased from 14.57 (Periods 20-26) to 141.67 (Periods 27-29) (+872%)

Historical concluded messages confirm a demand regime shift starting Period 27 (sharp increase in weekly demand: 69,167,189,176) so I focus forecasting on this recent high-demand regime. Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods; no new sustained lead-time evidence so use promised/default. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (Periods 27-30) to capture the new higher mean and volatility; this yields (1+L)-scaled demand over review+lead. This balances service (capture recent spike) against holding cost given large in-transit position.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has jumped starting Period 27 (weeks 27-31: 69,167,189,176,141) \u2014 new high-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=608 (includes prior large orders; some earlier shipments were delayed/lost but Period 4 confirmed lead time=2). I keep L as default (promised=2) because concluded arrivals support lead_time=2 and missing shipments are intermittent; OR backend expects promised L. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (most recent 5 weeks) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last5). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices focus stock toward current elevated demand while using promised lead time to avoid overcorrecting for occasional lost shipments.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has jumped since Period 27 (weeks ending 2019-08-12 onward); last 5 observed weekly demands = [189,176,141,163,147] (Periods 29-33/available up to P32) averaging ~167. On-hand=0, in-transit=461 (sizable pipeline). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 periods; use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on the 5 most recent demand samples) so the OR backend targets service for the new higher mean while measured volatility reflects recent variability. This balances higher service (profit $19) against low holding cost ($1) and leverages large in-transit stock to avoid over-ordering.

Observed concluded arrivals show lead time = 2 periods consistently (Period 4 and Period 32). Demand has shifted up starting Period 27 (spike in Periods 27-33); recent regime length = 7 periods (Periods 27-33). To protect service while avoiding excess holding, set L by calculated average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect the new high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend builds a larger base-stock appropriate for the sustained demand increase.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period 27 (Aug weeks) \u2014 recent demands much higher than early-year low regime. Observed concluded lead times: Period 4 showed P2\u2192P4 (2), Period 32 showed P30\u2192P32 (2) => confirmed lead time = 2 from concluded history. Current on-hand 0 + in-transit 632 (includes recent large orders); also note a previously missing shipment (Period 13) but recent arrivals confirm lead_time=2. To target service while controlling holding cost, set L by calculating average observed lead times (evidence = two confirmed 2-period arrivals). Use recent demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat: take recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 27\u201334, 8 samples) so forecasts reflect the high-demand regime and avoid stockouts while cap will limit extreme orders.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=30, in-transit=540. Historical concluded lead-times observed: 2,2,3 (avg \u22482.33) and there is a known missing shipment (Period 13 order not concluded). Demand regime shifted up at Period 27 and recent demand since then is elevated and sustained. To hedge lead-time variability and potential delays use calculated average lead time (captures observed 2.33). For demand I use a recent_N window covering the post-changepoint regime (Periods 27+ => 10 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and volatility; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by letting the OR backend compute the exact base-stock and cap using these updated inputs.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand regime is the high regime starting Period 27 (recent weekly demands: 234,117,76,62,76). On-hand=0, in-transit=552 (multiple outstanding orders; some prior shipments delayed/lost e.g. Period13 order long-overdue). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,3} (orders placed P2\u2192arrived P4; P30\u2192P32; P33\u2192P36). I set L using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the latest observed lead-time mix (avg ~2.33) rather than the promised 2 to partially allow for occasional 3-period delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 33-37) so mu_hat covers review+lead demand in the current regime. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices hedge service level upward given large in-transit and recent high demand while limiting extra holding by using recent samples rather than all-time averages.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=540. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4), 2 (P32), 3 (P36), 1 (P38) \u2192 average ~2. Use 'calculate' for L to let backend set L=2. Demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 27; to capture the recent elevated mean/volatility I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N so the backend uses the most recent samples. Chosen N=9 balances using a multi-week recent window (min 3, cap 20) to reflect the post-change regime while smoothing week-to-week noise. This increases target base-stock to prioritize service (profit >> holding cost) but remains bounded by the engine cap; using recent data also avoids diluting the strong recent demand signal with much older low-demand weeks. No single missing-shipment event new enough to change lead-time insight beyond using the observed average.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=544 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W={2,2,3,1}) and an earlier missing shipment (Period13) but no new sustained lead-time shift; I use a recent average to reflect recent variability. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 27 (high demand from P27+); to capture the current regime I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility over the most recent regime. L set to recent_N average of the last 4 observed lead times (captures variability 1\u20133). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=13 (periods 27\u201339 regime length=13) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on the current high-demand regime. This balances higher service level during the sustained high-demand regime while relying on the large existing in-transit volume to limit new orders.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been at a higher, variable level (Periods 35-40 demands = [76,62,76,102,43,42], recent mean \u224866.8) after the large regime rise starting Period 27. Observed concluded lead times = {P4 from P2:2, P32 from P30:2, P36 from P33:3, P38 from P37:1} \u2192 average \u22482.0 but with variance and at least one lost/delayed shipment (Period 13 order never concluded). On-hand=0, in-transit=544 (pipeline substantial). To balance service vs holding cost: set L by calculating average observed lead time to reflect actual behavior (captures occasional 3 and 1 period leads); set demand forecast using recent data to adapt to the newer higher regime (use last 6 weeks to capture current pattern); set sigma using the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to recent high demand while the calculated L accounts for observed lead-time variability and missing-shipment risk when combined with pipeline checks.

Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,3,1,2} \u2192 average ~2; use calculate to reflect observed mean. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 27 (noted in carry-over); to focus the forecast on the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (captures the most recent 12 demand observations spanning the post-changepoint regime). These choices: L=calculate lets the OR backend use observed lead-time behavior; mu_hat recent_N concentrates forecast on current high-demand regime to avoid understocking; sigma_hat recent_N uses recent volatility to size safety stock appropriately given higher recent demand and downstream holding cost tradeoff (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Historical concluded lead times show variability (recent concluded Ls = 3,1,2); average of last 3 = 2 \u2192 use recent_N N=3 for L to capture current realized lead-time mix.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Recent demand regime (spike since Period 27) remains in effect; last 17 periods (P27\u2013P43) avg demand \u2248117.4/week so a (1+L)=3 review+lead forecast \u2248352 units. Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,3,1,2} avg=2 \u2192 use calculated lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=540 which exceeds the 3-period demand forecast (~352) so pipeline coverage is adequate; this lets OR backend target service while avoiding extra holding. Methods chosen: L by calculate to reflect observed lead-time evidence; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=17 to capture the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility. No new lost-shipment signal strong enough to override concluded lead-time estimate.

Demand shows a sustained regime change starting Period 27 (large persistent increase from prior low regime). Use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the current high-demand regime; regime length from P27\u2013P44 = 18, so N=18 (captures recent elevated mean/volatility). Using recent_N balances service (higher mu_hat) while sigma_hat recent_N captures realized variability to size safety stock and respect holding cost.
