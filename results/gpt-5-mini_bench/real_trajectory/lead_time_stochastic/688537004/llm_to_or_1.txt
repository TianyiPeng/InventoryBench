Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Initial inventory 0, no in-transit, and only five historical weekly samples available (0,0,69,88,88). No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence to contradict the promised lead time. Demand shows a recent uptick but not yet 3+ periods of sustained change; use default estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with promised L=2. This balances service (captures recent higher samples via mean) versus holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=124 (order placed P1). Promised lead time is 2 and there is no concluded arrival yet, so no evidence of lead-time change or lost shipment. Recent realized demand: 2019-01-21:69, 2019-01-28:88, 2019-02-04:88, Period1 demand=77 \u2014 recent weekly demand ~75\u201388. I keep L as default (promised=2). To reflect the recent, stable demand regime, I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 samples (capture latest mean and volatility) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; this balances service level against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=247 (orders from P1/P2 not yet concluded). Recent demand rising: historical samples (0,0,69,88,88) plus P1=77, P2=94 suggest upward shift. I keep L=default (promised 2) because conclude messages so far show no confirmed alternate lead time; delayed arrivals may be late/lost but insufficient to confirm change. For demand I use EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.5) to weight recent higher-demand weeks more while retaining history; mu_hat will be (1+L)\xd7EWMA to cover review+lead period. Sigma_hat use default to let backend scale historic volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service for rising demand while relying on backend caps to limit over-ordering given uncertain arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent weekly demand elevated (~70\u201395) vs earlier zeros; on-hand=0, in-transit=318 (many outstanding orders possibly arriving later). No concluded arrivals with explicit lead_time observed, so do not adjust promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 samples (Jan28, Feb04, Period1, Period2, Period3 demands ~88,88,77,94,69) so the base-stock reflects current higher demand while limiting influence of earlier zero weeks. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Daily Profit: $316.00, Daily Holding Cost: $44.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $272.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent observed demand has shifted up: last three weeks show 69, 88, 88 vs earlier zeros. Concluded arrivals show one order (Period 2) arrived with lead_time=2, so actual lead time so far aligns with promised L=2; earlier orders (P1,P3) missing but not yet a sustained pattern. To be responsive to the recent demand regime, set lead time by calculating observed lead times and set demand estimates using the most recent 3 samples (captures the recent higher demand while keeping variability local). This increases base-stock to avoid stockouts while the OR backend caps orders via its cap formula, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand (periods 1-5): [77,94,69,79,124] shows a late spike but no sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=217 (pending arrivals from prior orders). Observed arrivals: Period 4 conclude shows order on P2 arrived in P4 \u2192 actual lead time evidence = 2. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=2. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus forecast on the most recent 5 demand samples (covers the full recent history including the spike). Use default for sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let backend compute volatility from full sample set. These choices keep safety-stock responsive to recent demand while acknowledging confirmed lead time and existing in-transit inventory when the OR engine computes the capped order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order on Period 2 arrived Period 4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. On-hand 0 + in-transit 302; recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed 2 and 1). Demand has trended up sharply (period demands: 77,94,69,79,124,172) \u2014 recent regime higher. I set L to "calculate" so backend averages observed lead times (captures 2 and 1). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to "recent_N" with N=4 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent higher-demand regime (Periods 3\u20136/4 most recent samples), balancing higher service needs against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=402. Recent demand has jumped (Periods 5-7: 124, 172, 198) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. Observed lead times are mixed (1 and 2 periods); use calculated average for L to let backend infer typical lead. To protect service during this higher regime while controlling holding costs, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demand periods (captures current elevated mean and volatility). This biases orders upward to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while letting the OR cap limit excessive receipts given pipeline=402.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent demand has jumped sharply: Periods 5-8 = [124,172,198,309]. On-hand=0, in-transit=342 (large pipeline but demand surge risk). Observed lead times from concluded messages vary (1 and 2); average lead time should be inferred from observed samples. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand forecast (mu_hat) uses recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (most recent 4 periods). Volatility (sigma_hat) also uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent variability. These choices prioritize service during a sustained demand increase while relying on backend lead-time averaging to handle mixed 1\u20132 period observations.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: avg increased from 79.75 (Periods 1-4) to 200.75 (Periods 5-8) (+121.0? check: +121.0?)

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 5 (P5-9 demands = 124,172,198,309,308) \u2014 confirmed high-volume regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=672 (includes P9 ordered=330 still not concluded). Observed concluded lead times = [2 (P4),1 (P6),2 (P8),1 (P8)] -> average 1.5. Choose L by calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history. For demand, use recent_N with N=5 (most recent high-demand regime P5\u2013P9) so mu_hat reflects elevated mean across the review+lead period. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (higher target stock for sustained high demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and some delayed arrivals.

I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand is high and elevated since Period 5 (periods 5-11 demands: 124,172,198,309,308,306,433). On-hand=0, in-transit=657 (large pipeline). Observed actual lead times in concluded messages alternate 1 and 2 (sequence of last 6 observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1], avg=1.5) so I use recent average for L. For demand I use a recent-window to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5-11). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect increased volatility. These choices (recent lead-time average and recent demand statistics) help the OR backend size the base stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the new high-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity will cap new orders via the backend cap rule, reducing risk of excess holding costs.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1 and 2 periods (observations: 2,1,2,1,2,1) so I let backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). Demand shows a sustained upward regime from Period 9 onward; use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=4 (Periods 9-12) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean/variance. These settings balance service (capture higher recent demand) while the large in-transit reduces aggressive ordering risk.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). On-hand=24, in-transit=817. Historical concludes show mixed lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2 \u2192 avg \u22481.57), and a sustained demand regime increase noted around Period 9 with higher recent weekly demand (~300s). To capture the empirically shorter-than-promised and variable lead time I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times. For demand and volatility I use recent_N over the most recent regime (9 periods from Period 5\u201313) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated demand level and recent variability, which will raise the base-stock to avoid stockouts while the OR backend caps orders to control holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=685. Historical arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2) with recent arrivals skewing toward 2; average of last 5 observed lead times \u22481.8 so I use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent behavior. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 5 (carry-over noted); recent demand (Periods 6\u201315 window) remains high and more representative than early low-demand samples, so I use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the last 10 demand observations. These choices aim to (1) reflect the slightly longer recent lead times to avoid understocking given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals, and (2) size base stock to meet the new higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check.

Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime since around Period 9 (recent demands ~300 units/week). Promised lead time=2. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (backend knows 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (covering Periods 9\u201315) to capture the elevated demand regime; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine targets a base-stock sized to current high-demand regime while recognizing the large in-transit inventory to avoid over-ordering.

Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=1123 (ample pipeline but arrivals are delayed/not yet concluded). Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 2 periods with some 1-period occurrences; I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning around Period 9 (pre-Period 9 mean ~80 vs post-Period 9 mean ~201). To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent 8 demand samples (Periods 9\u201316) to reflect current demand level and variability; this balances service (reduce stockouts in high-demand regime) vs holding cost given large in-transit balance.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (sustained high weekly sales ~300+); on-hand=59 and large in-transit=802 provide significant coverage versus forecasted demand. Promised lead time=2 and historical concluded arrivals mostly show 2-period behavior, so use default promised L to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. Use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 5\u201317, regime length 13) so the base-stock calculation reflects current elevated mean and volatility and avoids understocking despite large pipeline. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by increasing target stock for the higher demand regime while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). Recent demand is well above early-period levels (multiple 300+ weeks in Periods 10-18) and prior carry-over shows a sustained demand regime shift around Period 9. On-hand=0, in-transit=1067 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times include a mix of 1 and 2 but majority are 2; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed history. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 11-18) so base-stock targets match current demand and avoid stockouts; using recent volatility for sigma_hat captures current demand variability. The large in-transit pipeline plus (1+L)-based mu_hat will be reconciled by the OR engine cap. These choices prioritize service (capture heightened demand) while limiting excess holding by relying on recent demand stats and observed lead time.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand rose sharply at Period 9 and has stayed elevated; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 (recent regime from Periods 5\u201319) so the forecast and volatility reflect the higher-demand regime and avoid being pulled by the low pre-shift periods. These parameters help the OR backend build a base-stock covering the (1+L) review+lead horizon while reflecting current higher mean and variance so service levels remain high without excessive steady overstock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=1172. Historical concluded lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has been in a higher regime since ~Period 15 (Periods 15\u201320: demands = 346,538,379,352,505,799); I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the current elevated mean across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Volatility also elevated, so use recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent std. These choices keep orders aligned with the recent sustained demand spike while letting the OR engine compute base_stock and cap using observed lead-time average and recent demand stats. On-hand + in-transit (1172) currently provides coverage, but parameters ensure future replenishment matches the new regime and balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand further increased starting Period 15: avg demand for Periods 1-8 was ~200.75 (earlier shift at P9), recent avg for Periods 15-20 = 486.5 (+142.6%), sustained for 6 periods

Historical concludes show variable lead times (observed sample avg \u22481.55 periods) so use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has a sustained high regime starting Period 15 (Periods 15-20 mean \u2248486.5 over 6 periods), so forecast using recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current elevated mean and volatility. This choice ensures the OR engine targets a base stock sized to the new higher demand while using recent volatility to set safety stock; large in-transit partly covers (1+L) periods but using recent samples prevents underordering if the surge persists.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand is in a high regime (Periods 15-22 avg \u2248 486.5 with high variance; last 8 periods: 346,538,379,352,505,799,540,483). On-hand=0, in-transit=1621 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2), recent concluded lead times sequence = [2,2,1,1,2] \u2192 average 1.6. To capture the recent faster/slower mix I set L by averaging the last 5 observed lead times. For demand forecast I use the last 8 periods (the sustained high-demand regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current summer spike. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated demand while the large existing in-transit reduces immediate ordering risk.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has a sustained high regime beginning Period 15 (avg ~486.5 for P15-20) so I target the post-changepoint regime for forecasting. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132) but prior conclude evidence supports longer average than 1; I let the backend calculate the average lead time from observed concludes. I choose recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 15\u201323, regime_length=9 -> N=9). This raises base_stock to protect service during the high-demand summer season while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. On-hand (181) + in-transit (1077) currently provide substantial coverage, but given prior lost/late patterns I prefer the recent regime estimate rather than long-run mean.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been high and sustained since Period 15; last 8 demands (P17-P24) average ~525.9/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=1482 \u2014 pipeline roughly matches (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Observed concluded lead times average \u22481.58 periods (many 1s and 2s); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime (recent_N=8) to capture the elevated mean and volatility since the sustained shift starting ~P15. This biases orders to cover the higher demand while avoiding excessive holding cost because substantial in-transit stock already exists.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent demand is at a sustained higher regime (Periods 15+), with large weekly demand (recent weeks: 505,799,540,483,436,713,383). On-hand=0, in-transit=1807 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals are only visible next period. Observed concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 with average ~1.57, so use calculated average lead time. To target current high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility to reflect the last 7 weeks (captures the post\u2010P15 uplift and recent variability). These parameters will raise the base stock to meet elevated demand while the calculated L lets the OR backend account for observed shorter-than-promised deliveries.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Demand has exhibited a sustained upward regime since Period 15 (higher weekly demand sustained ~6+ periods) and lead times have been variable but the concluded history yields an average >1. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time (captures recent mix of 1\u20133 period arrivals). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 15\u201326) to capture the current high-demand regime; same N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher forecast for sustained elevated demand) against holding cost by basing base_stock on the current regime rather than long-ago low demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand peaked in late June/July (Periods 15-24) and has softened the last 3 weeks (Periods 25-27: 383,245,180). On-hand=145 + in-transit=1476 provides large pipeline cover versus current demand. Observed lead times vary but center on 2 periods with occasional 1\u20133; use a calculated average to reflect observed variability. Demand forecast uses a recent-window mean to capture the post-changepoint high-season regime while down-weighting the most recent softening; same recent window used for volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to realized lead-time variability and the recent elevated demand regime while avoiding excess holdings given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Demand has shown two sustained upward regime shifts (P9 and P15); recent high demand persists since Period 15. On-hand=8, in-transit=1582 (large pipeline) but past lead times have varied (1\u20133); concluded history contains many 2-period arrivals. I set L using calculate to let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures observed variability including occasional 3). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=14 (covering the sustained high-demand regime from Period 15 to the most recent data) so the forecast emphasizes the current higher-demand regime. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=14 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices bias stocking toward current high demand while relying on observed lead-time average to moderate over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=1582. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133), average \u22481.69 \u2014 I use calculated average to capture this variability. Demand has been in a higher regime since ~Period 15; recent periods (P15\u2013P29) sustain elevated demand, so I use a recent_N forecast for demand and volatility to capture the current regime rather than diluting with older low-season samples. These choices keep pipeline coverage aligned with observed lead-time variability and raise the backend base-stock to protect service while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand data.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Observed lead times have been variable but majority support a 2-period mode; use calculated average lead time to let backend infer exact recent mean. Demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning around Period 15 (recent elevated means through at least Periods 15-20). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the new high-demand regime (N=6 captures the sustained elevated window while meeting the N rules). This raises the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand and increases variability estimate to reduce stockouts while balancing holding cost given high profit-to-hold ratio.

Historical concluded lead times show variability (mostly 1\u20133, average ~1.7); recent demand has declined from the summer peak\u2014last 8 concluded demands (Periods 24\u201331) average ~241. To reflect persistent variability in lead time I ask the backend to calculate average observed lead time. To capture the current (post-peak) demand regime I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility around the most recent demand pattern while accounting for the in-transit stock.

Recent demand has fallen from summer peaks; last 4 periods demand = [133,67,69,45], indicating a lower short-term regime. To balance service level (large pipeline) vs holding cost, set L to calculated average of observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower-demand regime and reduce future overstocking risk given large in-transit quantity.

Using recent demand and recent volatility reduces overstock risk while the calculated L captures variable arrivals and avoids assuming perfect 2-period reliability.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand has fallen sharply since late Aug/Sep: P30-34 demands = [67,69,45,42,71]. Pipeline is large (in-transit=1476) and on-hand=0; several past shipments exhibited variable lead times (mostly 2, some 1, one 3). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures the mixed 1\u20133 period realizations). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to anchor the forecast to the most recent regime (periods 27\u201334) which shows much lower demand than the mid-year summer peak; this limits additional ordering given the large in-transit balance. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility rather than the inflated variance from the summer spike. These choices reduce the risk of over-ordering against the current low-demand regime while still accounting for observed lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand decreased starting Period 30: avg demand for Periods 30-34 = 58.8 (n=5) vs prior recent regime (Periods 15-20) avg = 486.5; sustained low demand for 5 periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (demands: P30-35 = [67,69,45,42,71,40], avg \u224856). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1476 units\u2014pipeline is ample vs current low demand, so no aggressive up-weighting. Historical concluded lead times are variable but majority evidence supports the promised 2-period lead time; I therefore use default L. To align the forecast with the recent low-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 6 concluded demand samples (Periods 30-35) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std on the recent regime. This reduces overordering given the large in-transit supply and lower demand, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 30 (demands: 67,69,45,42,71,40,34 -> recent avg ~54 over 7 periods). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1476 (covers multiple weeks), so avoid aggressive replenishment. Observed concluded lead times vary (mostly 2, some 1, one 3); use calculated average lead time to let backend quantify recent variability. Set demand forecast to recent regime (last 7 periods) to reflect the sustained drop and reduce overstock risk. Sigma set from same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices reduce holding cost while preserving service given large pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand regime: sustained low demand since Period 30 (periods 30-37, n=8) with weekly demand mostly 21\u201371. On-hand=0, in-transit=1476 (large pipeline but many recent periods showed no new concludes -> possible delayed/lost shipments; OR backend unaware). I set L="calculate" to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N N=8 (the 8-period low-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the sustained drop since Period 30, avoiding overstocking given large in-transit. This balances service (use observed lead time) vs holding cost (lower mu_hat reduces ordering while pipeline exists).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 30 (recent demands P30-38: 67,69,45,42,71,40,34,21,35; avg ~44). On-hand=0, in-transit=1476 (large pipeline). Many past orders show variable lead times but promised lead time is 2; no new conclusive arrival patterns since recent low regime. I choose L=default to let OR use promised 2-period lead time (backend expects promised LT=2). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period mean and volatility on the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 30-38). This avoids overstocking given the large in-transit quantity while still accounting for immediate upcoming demand over the review+lead horizon.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 30 (periods 30-39 mean \u224845.9). Observed concluded lead times (from concludes) average 1.75 periods (mix of 1\u20133). On-hand=0, large in-transit=1476 suggests prior replenishments outstanding or delayed; to be conservative we use the average observed lead time rather than the promised 2. I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend use the empirical average (1.75). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 30-39) to capture the sustained low-demand regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean_of_last_10_periods, aligning inventory to the current lower demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=10 to reflect recent reduced volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk given the long in-transit position while maintaining service for the lower current demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 30 (values ~21\u201371); latest 11-period average (P31\u2013P41 window) is ~41 units/week. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1476 (covers many weeks). Promised lead time is 2 and historical concluded arrivals support L\u22482, so keep L as default to align with supplier promise. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained low-demand regime and avoid overstocking given large pipeline. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility in the low-demand regime. These choices reduce target base-stock to match current demand while relying on existing in-transit stock to meet short-term sales, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=1476. Historical concluded lead times vary (mostly 1-2 periods, one 3); average of observed lead times ~1.74. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 30 (Periods 30-41: 12 samples, persistently low vs earlier high-season). To avoid overstocking given large in-transit and confirmed sustained low demand, set L by calculating recent empirical lead time (captures actual variability), set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent low-demand regime (recent_N with N=12) so the OR backend forecasts demand using the current low regime and reduces ordering despite large pipeline. This balances service level (cover near-term demand) against holding cost given heavy in-transit inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (multiple consecutive weeks of ~40-75 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=1476 which already provides substantial coverage. Lead time historically centers on 2 periods with occasional 1\u20133 noise; use promised lead time to avoid overfitting. To capture the sustained low-demand regime, set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 13 samples (Periods 30-42). This keeps orders aligned with current low demand and avoids excess holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=1476. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20133 periods but average of all observed concluded lead times \u22481.71; recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 30 (P30\u2013P43). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time (captures that actual LT \u22481.7 vs promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 30\u201343) to capture the sustained low-demand regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstating demand (avoiding excess holding cost) while accounting for the empirically shorter-than-promised lead time and the large in-transit position.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (many consecutive weeks with weekly demand ~30-75). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1476 (large pipeline that will cover multiple weeks when/if it arrives; several past shipments showed variable lead times including 1\u20133 periods and occasional long delays). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (lets the data-weighted mix of 1\u20133 period observations drive lead-time estimate). For demand I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained low-demand regime from Period 30 onward ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 15 samples). For sigma I also use recent_N with N=15 to reflect volatility in the same recent low-demand window. These choices reduce forecasted demand and safety stock compared with using all historical high-season samples, lowering holding costs while the large in-transit pipeline provides coverage if arrivals occur.

To avoid overstock while covering (1+L) periods of low demand, use promised lead time and basing demand estimates on the most recent low-demand regime (last 8 periods).

Observed concluded lead times vary but center on 2 periods; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand forecast uses the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 30\u201346, n=17) so set mu_hat recent_N with N=17 to reflect current low season. Volatility likewise should reflect the same recent regime, so sigma_hat recent_N with N=17. These choices avoid overstocking by anchoring to the sustained low-demand regime while letting the backend account for lead-time uncertainty and service-level tradeoffs given profit=$4 and holding=$1.
