Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward regime: 2019-01-21/01-28/02-04 = 10,16,24. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised L=2. I keep L as default (use promised lead time). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime; (1+L)=3 so mu_hat will be based on mean of last 3 samples (\u224816.67\xd73\u224850). For volatility I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. This focuses service level on the new higher demand while limiting inventory risk from older low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent avg (2019-01-21..2019-02-04)=16.67 vs prior avg (2019-01-07..2019-01-14)=1.00 (+1567%), sustained for 3 periods.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand regime confirmed (2019-01-21..2019-02-04 avg\u224816.67 vs prior\u22481.00, sustained 3 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=29 (ordered P1, not yet concluded). Use promised lead time (default L=2). Use recent_N for demand to capture the new higher regime (N=3 covering the 3 recent high-demand samples). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices raise the backend base-stock to meet the higher sustained demand while keeping holding cost awareness via the capped ordering policy.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent weekly demands = {10,16,24} (avg 16.67) vs prior low demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=56; two prior orders (P1,P2) have not concluded\u2014could be delayed/lost but inconclusive. Keep lead time at promised value to avoid overcorrecting. Set demand forecast using the recent high-demand regime (last 3 samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to capture current volatility. This balances higher service level for the new demand regime against holding cost given some inventory already in-transit.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (samples 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 mean=16.67 vs prior mean=1.00). On-hand=0, in-transit=121; recent concluded arrivals show a likely lost shipment for the Period 1 order but insufficient confirmed evidence to change promised lead time. Use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast use recent regime (last 3 samples covering the confirmed shift) so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to focus the OR backend on the higher recent mean and variance, balancing higher service level against holding cost given in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=174. History shows recent sustained demand regime shift from 2019-01-21 onward (recent mean \u224816.67/week over last 3 samples). A concluded arrival in Period 4 (ordered P2 arrived, lead_time=2) matches promised L=2, so use promised lead time. To capture the higher recent demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 weeks (changepoint at 2019-01-21, N=3). This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new regime while sigma from recent volatility controls safety stock to balance profit ($4) vs holding ($1). In-transit 174 appears sufficient to cover several weeks at the new mean; using recent_N avoids diluting the new higher-demand signal with earlier low-demand samples.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, In-transit=343 (many outstanding orders; several earlier orders failed to arrive on schedule). Lead-time evidence: Period 4 conclude shows arrived=27 (ordered P2) \u2192 observed lead_time=2, matching promised 2. Demand changepoint: sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 \u2014 last 3 samples (2019-01-21..2019-02-04) mean=16.67 vs prior mean=1.00 (3 periods sustained). I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean), and sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base stock to service the elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples; they also account for confirmed lead time so pipeline coverage is correct.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25. On-hand=12, in-transit=195. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime (noted previously starting 2019-01-21) and recent realized weekly demands are large (Periods 4-6: 144, 89, 157). Observed lead times are mixed: one arrival shows W=2 (P2\u2192P4) and one shows W=1 (P5\u2192P6), so actual lead time is variable. To balance service vs holding cost I set L based on the two most recent observed lead times (recent_N=2) to capture variability; I use recent 3-period demand to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and match sigma to recent variability (recent_N=3). These choices make the OR backend size orders for the elevated demand while reflecting recent lead-time variability and recent volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=385 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4 arrival from P2) and 1 (P6 arrival from P5) \u2192 recent average lead time likely between 1\u20132; use recent_N=2 to capture this. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime and last 3 concluded demands (P5..P7 = 89,157,184) show a sustained elevated mean (~143.3); use recent_N=3 for mu and sigma so the OR backend targets the (1+L)-period demand in the current high-demand regime. These choices balance service (higher mu to cover strong recent demand) while using lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering given large in-transit stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has been strongly elevated and volatile (recent concluded demands: P4=144, P5=89, P6=157, P7=184, P8=190). On-hand=21, in-transit=291 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers upcoming demand but lead times have varied. Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2 (order P2), P6:1 (order P5), P8:2 (order P6), P8:1 (order P7)}; average ~1.5. I choose L by calculate to let backend use observed lead times average. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher regime (uses the last 5 concluded demand periods). For sigma I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while letting the OR backend compute service-level safety stock given the inferred lead time variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent avg 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 = 16.67 vs prior avg 2019-01-07..2019-01-14 = 1.00; sustained 3+ periods). Lead time variability observed: concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1], avg \u22481.5.

LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5) so use calculated average for L. Use recent_N for demand and volatility to focus forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime; choose N=9 (captures recent periods since the shift). These settings bias base-stock toward meeting elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders to limit excess holding given holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=182, in-transit=174; profit=4, holding=1. Historical concluded lead times show alternating 2 and 1 (recent sequence 2,1,2,1) so actual lead \u22481.5; no sustained new shift since prior insight. Demand regime shift (higher demand since 2019-01-21) remains. I set L to recent_N to capture the observed variability (use last 4 observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N (last 5 demand periods) to capture the elevated post-changepoint mean while being responsive to recent volatility. Sigma uses recent_N (last 5) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias orders toward covering (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand while keeping safety stock responsive to observed volatility and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21 (multiple periods with high weekly demand) and currently on-hand=0, in-transit=339 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132); using 'calculate' lets backend average observed lead times (~1.5) instead of the promised 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (recent 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets reflect the new elevated mean and recent volatility while avoiding dilution from older low-demand weeks. This balances service (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand and substantial in-transit) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute safety stock with the recent mean/variance and the averaged lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained elevated weekly demand; recent periods show demands: 89,157,184,190,135,141,184,205). Observed concluded lead times show variability (sequence of 2 and 1 periods; average \u22481.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=540 (large pipeline). To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand (use last 10 concluded demand periods to reflect the sustained higher mean). For lead time I let backend calculate the average of observed lead times (calculate) so the OR engine learns the ~1.5 shift from concluded arrivals. For volatility I use recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings bias orders toward the higher-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline will limit new orders via the capped policy.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since 2019-01-21 (recorded previously) and mix of concluded lead times alternating 1 and 2 (avg \u22481.5). Current inventory: on-hand=1, in-transit=375 \u2192 ample pipeline but arrivals are observed with variable lead times and some orders previously delayed. To capture the observed lead-time variability I use recent_N for L (average of last 4 observed lead times). To anchor demand to the recent high regime I use recent_N for mu_hat (use last 6 demand samples to reflect current elevated demand). For volatility I also use recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep orders responsive to the confirmed higher demand while accounting for lead-time variability so the OR backend will compute a base-stock that balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) and avoids excess additional inventory beyond the large pipeline already in-transit.

Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence ~[2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2]) so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime (sustained since 2019-01-21); I use a recent_N demand estimate to focus forecast on the current high-demand regime. I choose N=6 (captures the most recent 6 demand periods through Period 14) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base stock and safety stock reflect recent elevated mean and volatility, while the calculate lead time helps reconcile the variable arrivals and avoid underordering given high in-transit but zero on-hand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=586. Historical concluded arrivals show lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,2] (avg \u22481.67) indicating actual LT > promised sometimes. Demand has sustained the higher regime since 2019-01-21 (recent periods show high weekly demand: 141,184,205,164,232,268). To protect service while limiting holding cost: set L to the average of observed lead times (calculate) so backend accounts for longer effective pipeline; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to reflect the new high-demand regime with N=6 (last 6 demand periods) so forecast and variability focus on the sustained higher demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time updated: observed concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,2], average \u22481.67 (confirmed over 6 observations); modal LT=2 periods.

Concluded lead-time history (Periods with arrivals) shows variability with modal=2 and mean\u22481.67; I set L to be calculated from all observed lead times so the backend uses the empirical average. For demand I choose recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (captures last 5 demand samples). I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) so volatility reflects recent regime. These choices prioritize service for the sustained higher demand while the OR engine will cap orders to limit excess holding given the large in-transit position.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=121, in-transit=433 (pipeline ample but demand is high). Observed concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,2] (avg\u22481.67, modal=2). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses empirical avg. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (covers the most recent 5 concluded periods). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Historical concluded lead times show variability but modal=2 and avg\u22481.67; to let OR backend learn this I select 'calculate' for L so backend averages observed lead times. Recent demand has been persistently higher (most recent 6 concluded demands: 164,232,268,270,195,180; recent mean\u2248218) so I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated regime and recent volatility. These choices aim to raise the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of current high demand while reflecting recent demand variance; using backend-calculated L from observed data helps account for the mixed lead-time evidence without overcommitting to an explicit longer LT.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has settled at a much higher regime: last 6 demands (P14..P19) = [232,268,270,195,180,211], mean=226 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=530 units which is below the (1+L)-period demand requirement (with L=2, (1+L)*226\u2248678), so we should target a higher replenishment level. Observed concluded lead times historically are centered on 2 (modal=2, avg\u22481.67), and promised lead time is 2 \u2014 use default L to keep OR engine consistent. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility so the backend raises the base stock and cap appropriately.

Historical concluded lead_times show mostly 1\u20132 periods with modal=2 and recent average \u22481.67; I treat effective LT as 2 to be conservative vs. promised. Demand regime shifted up (confirmed earlier) and recent demand (last 8 periods: P13..P20) averages ~206.9/week; to capture current high-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast over the last 8 samples. sigma_hat also uses recent_N over the same window to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock higher to avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty and observed 1\u20132 period LT variability while the recent_N volatility keeps safety stock responsive to recent demand variability.

Lead time: modal/confirmed LT=2 (multiple concluded observations); use explicit L=2 to capture dominant behavior. Demand forecast: use recent 5-period regime (demands: P17..P21 = 195,180,211,135,103) to reflect current demand level and recent decline; set mu_hat using recent_N=5 so backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean.

Demand regime shift to higher weekly demand was previously confirmed (starting 2019-01-21) so use a recent demand estimate rather than the long-run mean. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (2) for OR engine consistency, mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime over recent periods, and sigma_hat=default so backend uses overall observed volatility scaled for (1+L). This balances service (capture higher recent demand) while avoiding excess further inventory given a large in-transit position.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times modal=2 and average \u22481.67, but promised lead time is 2; preserve promised LT for OR engine to avoid underordering given occasional 2-period deliveries. Set L='default' (use promised=2). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the ongoing high-demand regime while giving weight to the most recent 8 weeks of realized demand and volatility; this balances service level with holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=26, in-transit=530. Recent concluded lead-time observations cluster at 2 with average \u22481.67 and mode=2; use explicit L=2 (conservative, matches modal LT and avoids understock). Recent demand has moderated vs earlier peaks; use recent_N for demand estimates to capture current regime. I select N=5 (last 5 periods: P20..P24 demands = 135,103,84,50,43) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower-demand regime and short-term volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=530 (pipeline adequate vs recent demand). Recent concluded lead times show six observations [2,1,2,1,2,2] (avg~1.67, modal=2) so I use recent_N over those 6 obs to capture current LT. Recent demand has softened from spring peak; last 5 realized weekly demands = [103,84,50,43,34], so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower summer demand and its volatility. These settings help the OR backend size orders to cover (1+L) periods at the recent mean while reflecting reduced variability, avoiding excess holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

Historical concluded lead-times show modal LT=2 and long-run avg \u22481.67; pick explicit L=2 to reflect dominant observed LT and avoid under-ordering. Recent demand has fallen from spring peaks; use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to track the current lower-summer regime (last 6 demands: Periods21-26 = [103,84,50,43,34,24]) so the OR backend will scale forecast to (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility.

Recent realized demand (Periods 21-27 = 103,84,50,43,34,24,22) shows a downshift vs early-year peak; I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 periods to capture the current lower-demand regime. Using recent averages reduces risk of over-ordering given large in-transit stock while keeping service for current demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has softened through summer (Periods 20-28: [135,103,84,50,43,34,24,22,27]); I'll use promised L to keep alignment with supplier terms and use a recent_N forecast to capture the downward seasonal regime. Parameters chosen: L=default to trust promised lead time and avoid overcorrecting for sporadic LT variability; mu_hat with recent_N (N=9) to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the last 9 observed weekly demands; sigma_hat with recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent reduced volatility. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit stock and reduces holding cost while maintaining service for short lead time.

L set to 'calculate' to use observed average LT; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=9 (last 9 demand samples) so orders reflect current lower demand and reduce holding cost given heavy pipeline.

On-hand=0, in-transit=530 (large pipeline that should cover upcoming demand if it arrives). Historical concluded lead times cluster at 2 (modal=2) and recent evidence supports using the promised lead time. I use L=default to keep promised lead time=2. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime (most recent 5 samples). For sigma I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus orders on the current low-demand regime while accounting for pipeline inventory to avoid excess holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

Recent demand (Periods 22-31) shows a lower, stable regime vs earlier spring peaks; I use recent_N=10 to capture the current weekly average (~38) over the last 10 concluded periods. Choosing recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the current demand regime and the observed variability, while leaving L as default (promised 2) to avoid mismatching OR engine expectations and to let the backend cap/order logic handle pipeline.

Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=530 (large pipeline covering several periods). Historical concluded lead-times cluster at 2 (modal=2, observed avg \u22481.67) so I use explicit L=2 to match operational reality and promised guidance. Recent demand has settled well below the early 2019 spike; last 12 concluded demands (P21..P32) average \u224841.2/week. I set mu_hat using recent_N=12 ( (1+L)\xd7recent mean will let the OR backend size orders for review+lead period ). Demand volatility is estimated from the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N=12) to capture current variability and avoid overstock from the old high-demand regime. This balances service (use recent demand) vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded lead times (6 obs) average \u22481.67 with modal=2, so I use a calculated lead time rather than the promised default. Demand forecast uses recent data to reflect the sustained lower regime since late spring: I select recent_N=10 to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases orders on the current low-demand regime while the L estimate (calculate) captures observed faster-than-promised arrivals on average. This balances service vs holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (lower mu reduces overstock risk while observed pipeline reduces urgent ordering).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=530. Recent demand (Periods 22..35, 14 samples) avg \u224829.7/week; this is the relevant low-demand regime since the Jan spike is historical. Observed concluded lead times previously cluster at 2 (modal) with avg \u22481.67, so use L=2 (explicit). Set mu_hat based on recent regime: use recent_N over the last 14 demand samples to capture current low-demand mean across review+lead (1+L=3). Use sigma_hat recent_N with same N=14 to reflect recent volatility. With pipeline=530 >> expected (1+L)*mean\u224889, no immediate replenishment pressure; these settings avoid unnecessary ordering while the OR backend will compute a conservative base-stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead-times show modal LT=2 and no new sustained LT change; recent weekly demand (Periods 31-36) is low (9,11,9,9,7,6) vs earlier high regime\u2014I target recent demand to avoid overstock. Set L to promised (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce forecasted order quantities and volatility so OR backend lowers base stock and holding costs.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. Recent demand has settled at a low regime (last 7 weeks: 9,11,9,9,7,6,6; mean\u22487.57). In-transit=530 units is large relative to current demand and will cover many periods; avoid inflating orders. Lead time evidence (carry-over) shows modal/confirmed LT=2. I set L explicit=2 to reflect confirmed modal lead time. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the current low-demand regime ((1+L)-period demand computed from the most recent 7 samples) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and limits extra ordering given the large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=530. Historical concluded lead times cluster at 2 (modal=2, avg\u22481.67) so I set L explicitly to 2. Recent demand has shifted from early high-Jan peaks to a sustained lower regime through summer\u2013fall; to capture the current low, stable demand pattern I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts over review+lead using the most recent 20 samples. This keeps inventory tuned to current demand while the confirmed LT=2 avoids underordering from underestimated transit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. Recent weekly demand has settled low (Periods 31-39: 9,11,9,9,7,6,6,6,8) after the large early-2019 regime. On-hand=0 but large pipeline=530 units (in-transit); no recent concluded arrivals so treat promised LT=2 as operative. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (stable modal LT=2 observed historically). For demand I use recent_N on the most recent low-demand regime (last 9 weeks, Periods 31-39) so mu_hat reflects current low demand rather than early-2019 spikes; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N to capture current volatility. This reduces excess holding while meeting near-term demand; the large in-transit will be netted by the OR engine when computing order quantity.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been low and stable (many weeks of single-digit demand since Period 21), whereas earlier in the year a high-demand regime existed (confirmed previously). In-transit=530 units, on-hand=0 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times cluster at 2 with mean \u22481.67 and modal=2; to be conservative I set lead time = 2. Use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the prolonged low-demand regime: use N=20 (captures recent 20 weeks of low demand) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This reduces risk of overstock given large pipeline and high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4), while still allowing OR to top up if pipeline depletes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand (Periods 31-41) is low and stable (~7-9 units/week); on-hand=0 but large in-transit=530 units (covers many weeks). No new sustained changepoint since prior insights. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 variability and modal=2). For demand I use recent_N on the most recent 11 weeks (Periods 31\u201341) to capture the current low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat, keeping safety stock aligned to current demand rather than the high early-2019 spike. This reduces overstock risk given the large pipeline while still protecting service.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent weekly demand has settled low after mid-year (last 10 concluded demands P33..P42 mean \u22487.1). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=530 units (covers many weeks), and historical concluded lead times cluster at 2. I use the promised/default lead time (L=2) aligned with modal observed LT, and set demand estimates from the most recent stable regime (recent_N N=10) to reflect the low current demand and reduce ordering aggressiveness. sigma_hat also from the same recent 10 samples to capture current volatility. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock low (matching current demand) while recognizing existing in-transit stock to avoid excess holding cost.

Use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimate on the most recent stable regime to avoid overstocking given high pipeline.

Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent weekly demand has been low and stable since summer (many consecutive weeks with demand \u22486\u20139), so the high-Jan 2019 spike is an older regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=530 (large pipeline) \u2014 no immediate need to inflate target. I use the promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the most recent regime to avoid carrying excess stock from the Jan spike: mu_hat recent_N with N=20 (captures the low stable summer/fall regime), sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base stock aligned to current low demand while the large in-transit quantity covers near-term demand, reducing holding cost risk.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (last 10 demands mean \u22485.9 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=530 units (large pipeline that already covers multiple weeks). Historical concluded lead times cluster at 2 with average \u22481.67 and modal=2; use L=2 to reflect the dominant observed lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=10) to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent low-demand regime (reduces excess holding given large in-transit stock). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture current low-volatility behavior. These choices lower target base stock relative to earlier high-demand periods while accounting for a 2-period lead time and observed recent variability, balancing service level and holding cost given the substantial pipeline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent demand (Periods 21\u201346) is a low-rate regime after the earlier Jan spike; last 26 samples show subdued weekly demand (single- to double-digits). On-hand=0, in-transit=530 (large pipeline arriving but not yet concluded). Historical concluded lead times show variability with modal=2 and average \u22481.67; to reflect realized supplier behavior I use an empiric average. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent low-demand regime (use last 20 samples) so the OR backend targets inventory for current low-demand levels and avoids excess holdings while L from observed data accounts for lead-time variability.
