This suggests a regime shift toward higher demand that the OR (which weights all history equally) underweights. Step 4 \u2014 Inventory coverage target: with L+1=3 periods and a revised single-period demand \u224816.7, expected 3-period demand \u224850. To avoid lost sales given rising trend and no pipeline, I order 50 units to cover the next 3 periods plus modest extra safety. Step 5 \u2014 Risk tradeoffs: ordering 50 (vs OR 27) increases holding cost risk if trend reverses, but expected additional sales (profit $4) justify the extra inventory given clear sustained increase in recent weeks.

Concluded messages show no arrivals yet; actual lead time may be >=2 or shipments delayed but 50 units remain in pipeline. Demand evidence: recent realized demand jumped to 20 then 55 (Periods 1\u20132), and prior carry-over insight already flagged a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (3+ periods of higher demand). OR's recommendation (32) is based on older history and promised lead time; it under-reacts to the recent surge. Inventory policy calculation: with promised L=2 we must cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand because current period demand occurs after ordering. Using recent realized demands (20 and 55) gives a conservative recent-period mean \u224837.5 units/period; rounding to 38. Three-period requirement \u2248114 units. Current pipeline+on-hand = 50, so order \u224864 units to reach ~114. I choose 64 units to replenish pipeline given the sustained upward demand and risk of lost/delayed shipments.

Demand outlook: recent realized weekly demand is increasing sharply (Period1=20, P2=55, P3=81). Recent 3-period average demand \u2248 (20+55+81)/3 = 52 units/week. Policy target: ensure coverage for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (current period demand happens after decision), so expected demand over review+lead = 3 * 52 = 156 units. Pipeline coverage = in-transit + on-hand = 114 + 0 = 114. Order needed = 156 - 114 = 42 units (floor to 0 if negative).
