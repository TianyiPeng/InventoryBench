Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows a sharp upward shift: samples (2019-01-21,01-28,02-04) = 22,71,102. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time issues, so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (N=3). This biases the base-stock toward the higher recent mean while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated variability; L kept default to avoid overreacting to unconfirmed lead-time changes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent 3-week avg = 65 (22,71,102) vs prior 2-week avg = 1.5 (2,1); sustained increase observed over 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand regime confirmed (sharp shift starting 2019-01-21: last 3 samples 22,71,102, recent avg=65). On-hand=0, in-transit=132 (order placed P1) \u2014 arrival not yet concluded, so use promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=2). For demand, use recent_N N=3 to capture the new higher regime: backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last3)=3\xd765=195. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the sustained higher demand while constraining excess holding by using only the confirmed recent regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Demand has clearly shifted up (recent realized demands: 22,71,102 plus Period1=86 and Period2=118). On-hand=0, in-transit=244 (expected arrivals not yet visible by conclude rules). I retain promised lead time because no concluded arrivals exist to prove a lead-time change (use L=default). To capture the new higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (using the five most recent samples from the new regime: 22,71,102,86,118) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and scales volatility to recent variability. This balances higher service-level needs from the sustained demand increase while avoiding overstating uncertainty.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand regime confirmed (shift beginning 2019-01-21: recent 3-week avg = 65 vs prior ~1.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=294, but three consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 for orders placed in Periods 1-3 \u2192 strong evidence of delayed or lost shipments beyond promised L=2. To be conservative I set lead time explicit longer to force the OR engine to hold more pipeline coverage. Demand forecast uses the recent high-demand regime (recent_N=3 of samples 22,71,102) to capture the elevated mean; sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices raise base-stock to protect service during suspected prolonged lead times while aligning safety stock to recent demand variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time likely >2 periods or shipments lost: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (total 294 units) have not arrived by Period 3 conclude, indicating sustained delivery failure.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Demand has undergone a sustained regime shift since 2019-01-21 (recent 3-week avg = 65 vs prior ~1.5). Current on-hand = 57, in-transit = 287; Period 4 conclude shows Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2), so actual lead time aligns with promised 2. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (confirmed W=2). For demand, I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (weeks with 22,71,102). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (capture elevated demand) while using confirmed lead-time information to avoid over-ordering against phantom delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period2 order arrived Period4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $188.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): recent demand regime is the higher level that began 2019-01-21 (recent demands: 22,71,102, then later 55,55,49). On-hand=8, in-transit=287 (large pipeline). Lead-time observations include a confirmed 2-period arrival (Period2\u2192Period4). To bias ordering toward the new higher-demand regime while accounting for confirmed lead time and large pipeline, I use default for L (promised=2), recent_N N=3 for mu_hat to capture the elevated recent mean, and recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while the pipeline already provides substantial cover; these choices help the OR backend raise service level to avoid stockouts but limit extra holding by using a short recent window.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand regime (since 2019-01-21) is elevated: last 3 sample demands = 22,71,102 (avg=65). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=287 \u2014 substantial pipeline that should cover upcoming demand but arrivals are observed with a 1-period conclude delay. Lead-time evidence (Period4 conclude) confirms a 2-period actual lead time. To bias the OR engine toward the higher recent demand regime while respecting the confirmed lead time and avoiding excess holding, I set L to default (promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher mean and recent volatility (uses the three large samples). This directs the backend to target a base stock aligned to the elevated demand while the large in-transit position reduces additional ordering pressure.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has settled after the Jan regime shift; last 3 realized demands = [49,25,55] (avg=43) so short-term demand \u224843/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=287 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to 3-period demand (3\xd743=129). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4); earlier orders (P1,P3) failed to show but recent evidence supports promised lead time. To avoid over-ordering given high pipeline, use L=default (promised 2). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current post-shift regime (N=3 chosen because a sustained shift was detected and only 3 recent post-shift samples are available). This config lets the OR backend target service for current demand while recognizing the large in-transit stock (so final order likely zero), balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent weeks show sustained higher demand vs early-sample quiet periods; shipments previously delayed but lead-time evidence exists. I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed concluded lead times (reflecting confirmed 2-period observations). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the (1+L) forecast on the most recent 5 periods of realized demand (captures the post-changepoint higher regime). Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to measure volatility from the same recent window. These choices prioritize service (meet higher recent demand) while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent variability and observed lead time.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=287 (large pipeline). Historical/game demand shows a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21; most recent realized weekly demands (Periods 7-9) = 55,61,37 (avg ~51). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 in prior conclude messages. To reflect the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to single-week noise, I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 3 weeks) scaled by (1+L) and a recent_N volatility (last 3) so the OR backend sets base stock to cover the short-term elevated demand given the confirmed lead time. L is set to calculate so backend uses observed lead-time history (matching confirmed L=2).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand settled at a higher regime (recent weeks ~55 avg). On-hand=0, in-transit=287 (sizable pipeline). Promised lead time remains 2 and recent concluded arrivals support it, so use default L to let backend assume promised LT. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 7 demand periods (Periods 4\u201310) so the base-stock reflects current demand levels while the pipeline absorbs most near-term demand. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost since substantial in-transit inventory already exists.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived Period4) and a prior demand regime shift early in the record; recent demand has moderated. I keep L=default (use promised 2) because concluded history supports the promised lead time and there is no sustained new lead-time disruption. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last 5 observed demands (Periods 7\u201311 = 55,61,37,35,20) which reflect the current lower/moderate regime; this reduces sensitivity to earlier spikes and lets the OR backend size orders to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while controlling holding cost. No new lost-shipment signal to record.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4) and earlier lost shipments but recent confirms stable LT=2. Demand regime shifted upward starting 2019-01-21 and has been sustained; recent demand (most relevant) is higher than pre-shift. I choose L=default to use the promised (and recently-confirmed) 2-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained regime (captures latest demand average/variance while meeting the N bounds). This prioritizes service (profit per unit = $4) while limiting extra holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than the long-tailed historical baseline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period2 arrival at Period4) and no new sustained lead-time deviation. Demand regime shifted starting 2019-01-21; recent realized demands (Periods 4\u201313: 55,49,25,55,61,37,35,20,50,44) show a sustained higher-demand regime with recent mean \u224845. To reflect the sustained post-shift regime and recent variability while using the promised lead time, set L to default (promised=2), use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 to anchor the base-stock to the last 10 periods, and use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (captures higher recent demand) against holding cost by avoiding inflation from older low-demand samples and by using recent volatility for safety stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Demand has been in the elevated regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained higher weekly demand ~40\u201360). On-hand=0, in-transit=287 \u2014 pipeline already large relative to (1+L) periods of demand. I set L=calculate to use observed lead-time evidence (recent concluded lead time = 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the current elevated regime (most recent 11 weeks of demand) so mu_hat reflects current demand level rather than older low-demand weeks. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock aligned with the sustained higher demand while recognizing substantial in-transit inventory to avoid over-ordering and limit holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been elevated and sustained since the regime shift beginning 2019-01-21; current on-hand=0, in-transit=287 (pipeline substantial). Past concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 for observed arrival (Period2\u2192Period4) and no new sustained lead-time change is evident. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (last 13 periods) so the base-stock covers the elevated demand while the OR cap limits over-ordering given holding cost. I keep L=default (promised 2) because concluded history supports lead time=2 and missing shipments appear resolved; using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat adapts to the higher mean/variance observed since the Jan spike.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand regime established from 2019-01-21 onward (sustained higher weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=287 units \u2014 pipeline currently large relative to (1+L)-period demand. Observed concluded lead time evidence remains consistent with 2 periods (Period2\u2192arrived Period4). I set L to promised/default to keep model aligned with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained higher regime while smoothing short-term noise (last 8 weeks' demands ~37,35,20,50,44,45,60,28). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock focused on the current high-demand regime while the large in-transit stock will reduce new orders via the pipeline subtraction and cap, avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical concl: lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods (Period2\u2192Period4). Recent demand has settled lower than the initial spike; last 7 observed demands (Periods 11\u201317 = 20,50,44,45,60,28,29) average \u224839.4. I keep L as default (promised 2) consistent with confirmed observation. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to capture the current sustained demand regime (3+ periods) and avoid dilution by the early spike. This balances service (covering review+lead demand using recent mean) against holding cost by not inflating forecasts with the initial outlier periods.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Demand has remained in the elevated regime that started 2019-01-21 (sustained high weekly demand since Period 3). Recent on-hand=0 but large in-transit=287 (pipeline present). Lead time was confirmed as 2 periods in Period 4 conclude (Period2 order arrived in Period4), so use promised/default L. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the detected regime (Period3\u2013Period18 => 16 periods) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the recent elevated data, balancing service level against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has moderated after the early 2019 spike; last 7 concluded demands = [44,45,60,28,29,7,4] (mean ~33.9) so I favor a recent-window forecast. On-hand=0, in-transit=287 (large pipeline) so risk of stockout before arrivals is low; several earlier orders were delayed/lost but Period 4 showed a confirmed 2-period lead time, so keep promised L. Set L to default (promised=2) to let OR engine assume standard lead time. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and avoid overweighting the early-Jan spike; use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to estimate recent volatility. These choices keep orders conservative given large in-transit inventory while aligning safety stock to recent demand variability and confirmed lead-time behavior.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4) and earlier lost shipments resolved; therefore use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been low/moderate through May\u2013Jun (Periods 13\u201320), so I rely on a recent-sample forecast to reflect current demand regime and reduced volatility. Chosen methods: L=default to trust confirmed lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=8) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 8 demand observations; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=8) to capture recent variability. This keeps orders aligned with current lower demand while the large in-transit pipeline (287) prevents over-ordering and limits holding costs.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). Recent demand has fallen from winter peak; last 6 periods (P16-P21: 28,29,7,4,6,5) form the most recent low-demand regime. I set L by calculation to reflect observed lead-time evidence. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the latest low-demand regime (N=6 chosen as the detected recent regime length, between 3 and 20). This keeps target base-stock modest to avoid excess holding cost while covering short-term demand variability and the 2-period lead time; the in-transit 287 will be reconciled by the OR engine when arrivals conclude.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. Recent demand has settled to a low regime since 2019-04-01 (Periods 8\u201322: demands mostly 61,37,35,20,50,44,45,60,28,29,7,4,6,5,7) after the early spike in Jan\u2013Feb. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 287 (large pipeline). Prior carry-over confirmed lead time = 2. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (2). For demand I detect a sustained low-demand regime from Period 8 onward (length 15), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 to align the (1+L) forecast window and volatility with the current regime and avoid overstocking the large in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-07-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical concluded arrivals show a confirmed lead time of 2 (Period2\u2192Period4); subsequent many zero-arrival concludes suggest missing/delayed shipments but no new confirmed lead-time >2. Demand: earlier Feb\u2013Mar spike (Periods 3\u20135) was sustained, but demand has fallen to a lower recent regime (Periods 18\u201323: 7,4,6,5,7,5). I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed evidence (observed mean = 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new low-demand regime over the last 6 concluded periods; same recent_N N=6 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to current low demand while respecting confirmed lead-time evidence and avoiding overstock of in-transit units.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical demand shows an early spike (Period 3-5) then a sustained lower-demand regime from Period 8 onward. Recent 17 periods (P8\u2013P24) exhibit consistently low weekly demand (mostly single/double digits); I treat this as the current regime. Promised lead time is 2 and earlier concludes confirm 2-period lead for observed arrival, so use default L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=17 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime, reducing overstock risk given large in-transit inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=287 (large outstanding pipeline). Last concluded lead-time evidence (Period 4) confirmed lead time=2; no new concluded arrivals since Period 4 so do not infer a new LT. Recent demand (Periods 6\u201325) is substantially lower and more stable than the early surge in Feb\u2013Mar. To make the OR engine responsive to the current low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, using N=20 to capture the most recent 20 demand observations (sufficient sample while reflecting the post-spike regime). I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because concluded evidence still supports LT=2. Using recent estimates reduces excess stocking risk given holding cost, while the OR backend cap prevents overly large same-period orders despite the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has settled at a low level versus the early spike: last 9 concluded demands (Periods 18-26) = [7,4,6,5,7,5,5,10,24], recent mean \u2248 8.11/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=287 \u2014 ample pipeline for a short lead time. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 in prior evidence; no sustained new lead-time shift since. I use L=default (promised 2) to remain aligned with confirmed observations. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to reflect the current low-demand regime (N chosen equal to the 9 most recent periods showing stable low demand). This keeps the backend base-stock responsive to the current lower mean and volatility while avoiding carryover from the earlier short-lived spike. Pipeline (287) already covers multiple periods of expected demand, reducing near-term ordering urgency.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Historical concluded lead time observations confirm actual lead time = 2 in earlier evidence; no recent lead-time anomalies in concluded messages. Recent demand (Periods 21-27: 7,5,5,10,24,52) shows elevated variability and a late uptick (52 in Period 27). To be responsive to the recent uptick while limiting holding cost, keep promised lead time and use a recent-window demand estimate (captures latest regime) with a moderately small N to weight latest weeks. Sigma left to default (uses all samples) to reflect longer-term volatility for safety vs stockouts. This balances service level (covering recent surge) against holding cost given sizable in-transit stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Demand has a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21; recent weeks show elevated and variable weekly demand (many weeks with 20\u201369 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=287 \u2014 sizable pipeline exists. Promised lead time is 2 and prior concludes confirmed lead time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). I keep L as default (promised=2). To focus the forecast on the sustained post-changepoint regime, I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 samples, capturing current mean/volatility while respecting the large in-transit pipeline and limiting extra orders.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Recent demand has spiked (Periods 27-29 = 52,69,106). Promised LT=2 and concluded evidence earlier confirms LT=2. To respond to the newly sustained high demand I set L by calculate (uses observed lead times). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent regime (last 3 demands) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and the volatility under the current high-demand regime. This keeps target base-stock elevated to avoid stockouts while relying on recent observations rather than long history contaminated by prior zero-availability periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 27: recent 3-period avg = 75.67 (Periods 27-29: 52,69,106) vs prior 3-period avg \u224813 (Periods 24-26: 5,10,24); sustained increase observed over 3 periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=287 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals visible only via conclude messages; observed lead time evidence (Period2\u2192Period4) confirms 2-period deliveries. I set L via calculate to let backend average observed lead times (supports confirmed LT=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 4 periods 27-30) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)-period demand under the new regime. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the elevated demand while avoiding overstating volatility from older low-demand history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Earlier lost/delayed shipments were observed, but concluded arrivals (e.g., P4: P2 order arrived with lead_time=2) confirm promised lead time=2 remains valid. To capture the sustained higher demand, I use recent data for demand mean/volatility (most recent 5 periods). L uses the promised lead time to avoid overreacting to earlier temporary losses; recent_N for mu_hat/sigma_hat lets the OR engine target service for the new higher-demand regime while limiting holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 27 (demands: 52,69,106,84,87,68), so I target recent demand to set forecasts. On-hand=0, in-transit=287 covers multiple periods but may include older orders; promised lead time has been confirmed as 2 in history (Period2\u2192Period4). I use L=default to keep promised lead time=2, mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (1+L scaling applied by backend), and sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level for sustained elevated demand while avoiding overstating variability from older low-demand data.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent demand has been high since Period 27 with a sustained regime shift confirmed around Period 30 (Periods 27-33 show elevated weekly demand). Promised lead time 2 has been previously confirmed (Period2\u2192Period4 arrival). On-hand=0, in-transit=287 which already covers multiple weeks of demand at the new higher regime. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (2). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (most recent weeks 87,68,149) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture current volatility. These parameters prioritize meeting the elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits additional exposure to holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=366 (includes Period34 order=79 not yet concluded). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (Period2\u2192arrived Period4). Demand regime shift detected starting Period 27 (Periods 27-34 demand: 52,69,106,84,87,68,149,78) \u2014 sustained higher demand vs earlier periods. I set L to default (promised 2) consistent with concluded evidence. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 (use the 8-period post-changepoint regime length) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the recent higher-demand regime. This increases target base-stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping variance estimates tied to recent behavior.

For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (regime from Period27\u2013Period35: 9 samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent high-demand regime. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to capture volatility in the current regime. These choices focus the OR backend on the recent higher-demand mean/volatility while keeping lead time at the confirmed promised value, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 27 (periods 27-37 show consistently elevated weekly demand: 52,69,106,84,87,68,149,78,70,64,68). On-hand=0, in-transit=366 (covers multiple weeks but some past orders were delayed/lost historically). Promised lead time remains 2 and was previously confirmed by arrivals; no new sustained lead-time change observed. I set L=default to let the OR engine assume promised lead time. To capture the recent sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat (N=11, covering Periods 27-37) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent regime rather than diluting with old low-demand samples. I also use recent_N N=11 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while the large in-transit stock limits urgent extra ordering, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): demand has been in the higher regime since Period 27 (sustained elevated weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=366 so significant pipeline exists; promised lead time=2 is still consistent with observed concluded arrivals. Set L to default (use promised 2). For demand forecast use recent_N over the identified high-demand regime to capture the new mean/variance: regime length from Periods 27\u201338 = 12, so N=12. Use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=12) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant recent samples; this raises service level to cover the sustained higher demand while relying on existing large in-transit stock to limit new over-ordering.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Use promised lead time (default) because conclude history only confirms L=2 earlier and no new concluded arrivals prove a different L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and keep safety stock aligned to current variability; this balances service (avoid stockouts during elevated demand) against holding cost given existing in-transit volume.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime that began at Period 27 (Periods 27-40 show consistently higher weekly demand vs prior history). Concluded lead-time evidence (Period 4) established actual lead time = 2 in earlier checks; no new sustained lead-time shift observed, so use promised/default L. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast for both mean and volatility. Regime length from Period 27\u219240 = 14 periods, so N=14 (per rules: N = min(regime_length,20), >=3). These settings bias base-stock upward to meet current elevated demand while sigma_recent captures recent variability; using default L keeps timing consistent with concluded evidence and avoids overcompensating for earlier lost shipments.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 27 (sustained elevated weekly sales). On-hand=0, in-transit=366 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrival uncertainty exists historically; however concluded history confirms lead time = 2 in prior observations. To capture the elevated demand regime I use a recent_N forecast over the most recent 15 weeks so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher mean and volatility while keeping L at the promised/default (2) supported by concluded arrivals. This balances service (meet the higher ongoing demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=366. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4). Recent demand shows a sharp uptick (Periods 40-42 = 59, 78, 221) suggesting elevated short-term demand (holiday/seasonal). I keep L=default (promised=2, confirmed historically) so pipeline sizing aligns with observed arrivals. I use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime, ensuring the OR engine raises base-stock to meet near-term demand while capping orders to limit excess holding costs given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 27 (weekly demands 52,69,106,... through recent weeks including spikes like 149 and 221). On-hand=0 with 488 in-transit; many prior orders have not concluded reliably, but historical concluded arrivals confirm promised lead time=2 in earlier evidence (Period2\u2192Period4). Given clear recent high-demand regime, I use a recent-sample forecast to capture current mean/volatility. I set L to default (promised=2) because concluded lead-time evidence is mixed but the promise is 2 and the OR engine expects that. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 (captures the recent high-demand regime while limiting noise from older low-demand periods). This raises the base-stock to meet (1+L)-period demand and increases safety stock via recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and hold=$1.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=488. Historical concluded arrivals only confirm lead time=2 (Period4: P2\u2192P4). Recent weeks show elevated demand including a holiday spike (Period42=221) so I use a recent window to capture current level. Choose L by calculate (average of observed lead times = 2). Set mu_hat using recent_N N=8 to reflect the last 8 demand samples (Periods 37-44) and capture the recent higher mean. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level for current elevated demand while relying on observed lead-time evidence; in-transit stock is substantial so we avoid over-ordering beyond pipeline coverage.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand regime (starting Period 27) shows sustained higher demand vs earlier history (Periods 27-45 median/mean well above pre-27). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods in recent concludes (Period2->4 and Period43->45). Current inventory: on-hand=98, in-transit=366 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is large relative to one-review+lead horizon. I therefore keep L as default (promised 2). For demand forecast I anchor on the recent high-demand regime (changepoint at Period 27); use recent_N for mu_hat with N=19 (regime length Periods 27-45 = 19) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of those 19 recent samples. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=19 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders aligned to the elevated demand pattern while the large current pipeline reduces immediate order quantity risk, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent history: confirmed actual lead time = 2 periods (Period2\u2192Period4, Period43\u2192Period45). On-hand=93, in-transit=366 \u2014 ample pipeline cover vs elevated post\u2010Aug demand regime. Demand regime: sustained higher demand since Period27 (avg weeks 27\u201346 elevated); use recent regime statistics to capture this. Chosen methods: L set to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (confirms 2), mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'recent_N' with N=20 to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 periods (regime since Period27, regime length \u224820). This increases target base-stock to balance lost sales risk during high demand while accepting holding cost given profit/holding ratio.
