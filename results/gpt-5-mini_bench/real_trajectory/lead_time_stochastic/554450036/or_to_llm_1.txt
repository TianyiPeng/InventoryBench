{
  "rationale": "Current state: on-hand=0, in-transit=320. Promised L=2 but recent concluded history shows no arrivals in Periods 40\u201345 (six consecutive periods) despite large in-transit, and the last actual arrival was Period 39 (100 units). This implies actual lead time is longer than promised for recent orders or many shipments are lost/delayed; we cannot rely on the 320 as imminent supply. Demand: recent realized weekly demand (Periods 41\u201345) = [69,268,71,70,81] (average distorted by a 268 spike); typical recent non-outlier weekly demand \u224870\u201381. OR recommends 5 units using promised L and historical averages; that recommendation assumes reliable pipeline and short lead time. Trade-offs: ordering large now risks creating excess holding costs if the 320 eventually arrives; ordering too little risks stockouts if in-transit never arrives. Given (a) large uncertain in-transit, (b) no confirmed arrivals for six periods, (c) high holding cost exposure if shipments conclude later, I choose to avoid adding new inventory until we observe at least one concluded arrival that clarifies actual lead time/pipeline reliability. Final action: order 0 for SKU 554450036 this period and wait for concluded arrival evidence before replenishing. ",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Context & lead-time: Promised L=2 but recent concluded history shows arrivals stopped after Period 39 (last confirmed arrival P39); existing in-transit=320 has shown no concludes P40\u2013P46 so treat pipeline as unreliable/delayed until a conclude appears. Demand & objective: historical samples and carry-over indicate a higher-demand regime (Period13\u201315 avg\u2248103) and recent weekly demands have frequently been >70 (P40\u2013P46: 81,69,268,71,70,81,54). Profit/holding imply a high service target (q\u224819/20=0.95) so stockouts are expensive relative to holding cost. Decision logic: Because arrivals are uncertain, I cannot rely on the 320 in-transit; must cover (L+1)=3 periods of likely demand. Using a conservative single-period demand estimate \u2248100\u2013110 (consistent with recent regime), 3-period coverage \u2248300\u2013330. To balance risk of eventual arrival of the 320 (which would create large on-hand but holding cost is low), I choose a moderate hedge below full 3-period coverage to limit extreme overstock if the pipeline is not lost. Final order: 150 units \u2014 provides ~1.4\u20131.5 weeks coverage at recent demand levels, reduces immediate stockout risk while limiting potential overstock if the 320 later concludes. I will monitor Period 48 conclude for any arrivals and adjust future orders accordingly.",
