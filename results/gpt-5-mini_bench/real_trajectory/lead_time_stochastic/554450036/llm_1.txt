Product: women's skinny denim (steady baseline demand; some holiday bump possible). Demand analysis: recent demands P42\u2013P45 = [268,71,70,81]; P42 is an outlier (likely Black Friday); recent non-outlier weeks average ~74\u201381. Longer-run regime since P26 averaged ~99/wk but last few weeks trending ~75. Lead time & in-transit: history shows variable lead_time (1\u20133) and many delayed/lost shipments; treat in-transit as unreliable until individual arrivals conclude. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=219, in-transit=1558 (unreliable). Risk tradeoff: stockouts for this SKU are costly (profit $19) and holding cost is small ($1). Plan: be conservative about in-transit and top up to cover near-term demand assuming possible longer lead (3 periods). Target cover ~4 weeks at ~100/wk (buffer for holiday/regime uncertainty) => target supply \u2248400; with on-hand=219 place order for 200 units (rounding conservatively) to rebuild cover while limiting extra holding cost.",
