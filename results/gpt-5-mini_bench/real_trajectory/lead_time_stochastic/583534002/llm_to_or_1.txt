Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no conclude messages to suggest lead-time deviations or lost shipments. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 221 units/week; with promised lead time=2 and no evidence of regime change, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (using the data-driven base stock) against holding cost given moderate profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly mean demand = 221 units (5 samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=369 (ordered P1, arrived=0 in P1 conclude). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence actual lead time differs. No sustained demand regime shift detected. Use default lead time and default demand moments so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, providing a neutral baseline that balances service level vs. holding cost given current lack of new evidence.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~221 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=722. Two recent orders (P1,P2) have not yet concluded as arrived in conclude messages; however these are not yet late relative to the promised 2-period lead time (P1 would conclude at P3). I therefore retain the promised lead time and use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This balances service (use full-sample mean across 3 periods) versus holding cost while preserving ability to detect any true lead-time delays once conclusions appear.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=722; orders from Periods 1\u20132 have not concluded (no arrivals seen), which raises concern but is not yet a confirmed lead-time change. Recent realized demand has trended down (Period1=123, Period2=165, Period3=82). To be responsive to the recent lower demand regime while keeping promised lead time, I keep L as default (promised=2) and set demand estimates based on the last 3 observed demands to capture the recent downshift. mu_hat uses recent_N with N=3 (gives (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 periods). sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent variability. This reduces over-ordering risk given large in-transit stock and recent lower demand, while still supplying cover for the review+lead period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-98.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent realized weekly demand has dropped versus historical samples (Period1-4 demands: 123,165,82,51) and observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4). On-hand=302 + in-transit=369 provides substantial cover; (1+L)=3 review+lead horizon. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=2. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the clear downshift in demand and scale by (1+L). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=4) so safety stock reflects recent variability rather than older higher-demand samples. These choices reduce overstating mean demand (avoid excess holding) while keeping service given current pipeline and confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: P2 order arrived P4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=156, in-transit=369. Recent realized demands (Periods 3-5): [82, 51, 146] show short-term regime with volatility; Period 5 confirmed lead time=2 (carry-over). I use L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed confirmation). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to make the forecast responsive to the recent low/then spike pattern ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 periods) and capture short-run volatility for safety stock; this balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost given current positive on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $599.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent realized demands (Periods 3-6) were 82,51,146,151 with ending on-hand=5 and in-transit=369. Historical sample mean = 221 (samples: 367,213,219,181,125). Promised lead time is 2 and prior conclude (Period 5) confirmed lead time = 2. I use L=default to keep the model aligned with the promised/confirmed 2-period lead time. With L=default I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the full historical baseline (mean=221) while allowing the backend to apply the profit/holding calibration. Rationale vs. inventory: on-hand (5) + in-transit (369) gives substantial pipeline covering multiple periods, but recent high demands (146,151) justify maintaining the baseline (1+L) demand coverage to avoid stockouts. I note a potentially lost/overdue earlier shipment (see carry_over_insight) and keep conservative default estimators so the OR engine's cap and service-level calculus manage tradeoffs between profit and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipment: order of 369 units placed in Period 1 has not concluded (arrived=0 in Periods 2\u20136) and appears overdue/likely lost (evidence: P1 ordered=369, still shown in-transit as of Period 7).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=615. Confirmed actual lead time evidence: P2\u2192P4 arrival => lead_time=2; P1 order (369) appears lost/overdue. Recent demand shows uptick in last 3 concluded periods (P5\u2013P7 demands =146,151,187; avg \u2248161) versus earlier lower weeks, so I use a recent-3 demand estimate to capture current regime. Choose L='calculate' to lock to observed lead-time average (2). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the recent higher mean and volatility and thus raise the base-stock to meet service while limiting holding cost given confirmed lead time and missing early shipment.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Current on-hand=156, in-transit=369 (note: P1 shipment of 369 appears overdue/likely lost per prior evidence). Recent concluded lead times: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P7\u2192P8 = 1, so observed lead time has varied. I choose L='calculate' to average observed lead times (captures recent 1 and 2 period observations). Demand forecast and uncertainty use full-sample defaults (mu_hat='default', sigma_hat='default') so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost without overfitting short recent swings given limited history. This setup also leaves detection of the likely lost P1 shipment to be handled in future periods while using averaged lead time for ordering.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=97, in-transit=445. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead-time variability but earlier evidence (P2\u2192P4) supports promised L=2; there is a known missing/overdue P1 shipment recorded previously. I choose default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with promised L=2. Demand history (samples mean=221/week) will be applied by backend using default (1+L)\xd7mean so mu_hat uses all samples; sigma_hat uses all samples as well. This keeps the backend's forecast stable while the system observes in-transit outcomes and avoids overreacting to a single short/long arrival.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent weekly demand: P6\u2013P10 = [151,187,90,59,44] (mean 106.2) showing a downward trend after two high weeks. On-hand=129, in-transit=409 (some earlier orders likely delayed/lost per history). Observed lead times: P2\u2192P4=2, P7\u2192P8=1, P9\u2192P10=1 \u2014 short-term avg ~1.33. I choose L by averaging the last 3 observed lead times to let the OR backend adapt to recent faster arrivals while still reflecting one 2-period event (method: recent_N, N=3). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (includes both the high weeks and recent decline) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last5). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These settings bias orders toward meeting near-term demand while limiting excess stock given holding cost (holding=$1 vs profit=$4).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent realized weekly demand has fallen well below the Jan historical baseline: last 8 periods' demands (P4\u2013P11) average = 95.25 units/week vs. historical sample mean = 221. Observed concluded lead times: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P7\u2192P8 = 1, P9\u2192P10 = 1 \u2192 recent average \u2248 1.33. On-hand=95, in-transit=409; one earlier order (P1) appears lost but already recorded. To balance service and holding cost: choose L as recent average of observed lead times to reflect the faster 1\u20132 period mix (reduces overordering from assuming promised 2), and use recent_N (N=8) for demand mean and volatility so forecasts reflect the sustained lower-demand regime since P4. These settings reduce target base stock relative to historical defaults and mitigate excess holding of slow-moving inventory while preserving service given ample in-transit units.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=62, in-transit=409. Historical concluded lead times: P2\u2192P4 = 2, P7\u2192P8 = 1, P9\u2192P10 = 1 (P1 order appears lost). Demand has moderated recently (recent demands: 90,59,44,34,33). Given mixed observed lead times and a lost shipment, use empirical average lead time (calculate) to capture actual variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lowered recent demand regime and reduce overstock risk; use the same recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend set base_stock tuned to current demand while letting L reflect observed lead-time mix and mitigate holding cost from outdated higher historical means.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent weekly demand has settled at a much lower level than the Jan samples (recent 5 demands = 59,44,34,33,35; mean \u2248 41). On-hand=27, in-transit=409 but history shows at least one overdue/lost shipment (P1 369 units) and observed lead times vary (observed leads = 2,1,1). To be robust to variable lead-time evidence I use calculated average observed lead time so the OR backend learns the empirical lead-time (method=calculate). For demand I use the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current lower-demand regime (mu_hat recent_N N=5) and match sigma to the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=5). These settings bias orders toward the recent lower mean while allowing the OR engine to account for lead-time variability and avoid overstock given $4 profit/$1 holding.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent weekly demand has been steady and low (historical samples: 367,213,219,181,125 and recent periods showing 18\u201335/week). On-hand=9, in-transit=409 (large pipeline due to earlier orders); one early shipment (P1 ordered=369) remains missing/lost per prior insight. Observed concluded lead times: 2 periods (P2\u2192P4) and 1 period (P7\u2192P8) \u2014 variability suggests using the average observed lead time. I select L=calculate so backend uses observed average lead time, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the OR engine balance service level (via profit/holding cost) against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

History shows recent steady low weekly demand (last 5 demands: 34,33,35,18,23) after earlier higher peaks; there is also an overdue/lost early shipment but concluded lead-time observations exist (1,1,2). I set L to 'calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 period behavior). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to base the review+lead forecast on the most recent, lower-demand regime so we avoid overstock while maintaining service; this also mitigates impact of the likely-lost early order by sizing future orders to recent demand patterns.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent demand has settled much lower than early-period highs (last 5 demands: 33,35,18,23,15) indicating a sustained downshift; observed concluded lead-times are mixed (observed W={2 (P4),1 (P8),1 (P10)}) so average actual lead time \u2260 simply promised. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period realizations). For demand I choose recent_N N=5 to focus the forecast on the new lower regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability rather than early high-variance samples. These choices reduce overstock risk given the lower recent demand and account for the inferred shorter/variable actual lead time, balancing service level vs. holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W={2,1,1,2} \u2192 avg 1.5); shipments also show at least one lost/overdue earlier (Period 1 order). To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 q=4/(4+1)=0.8), use inferred average lead time rather than promised to let backend size pipeline appropriately. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecasts anchor to full historical sample mean/variance (scaled by 1+L) given limited recent structural evidence of a sustained demand shift.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=47, in-transit=409. Recent observed lead times vary (observed concluded arrivals: P2->P4=2, P7->P8=1, P9->P10=1, P15->P17=2) so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer current typical L. Demand has fallen and stabilized well below the published seed samples; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine uses full-sample statistics adjusted for chosen L. This balances service (using inferred L) versus holding cost given substantial in-transit volume (409) and modest on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift since Period 4: avg demand over Periods 4\u201318 = 61.1 units/week vs historical sample mean = 221 units/week (\u2248\u221272%), sustained across 15 periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained ~15 periods). Current inventory: on-hand=42, in-transit=409. Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2), so I let the backend compute the empirical average. To reflect the confirmed low-demand regime I use recent_N (N=15) for both demand mean and volatility so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the last 15 periods of realized demand; this reduces overstating demand and avoids excess holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=37, in-transit=409. Historical concluded messages confirm: lead time observed as 2 periods (Period 2\u21924) and there is a sustained low-demand regime since Period 4 (Period 4\u201320 average \u224861/week vs historical ~221). Also one early shipment (Period 1) appears lost but later arrivals (e.g., P7\u2192P8) sometimes show 1-period. To be conservative I keep L at the promised/default (2). To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I set demand estimates using recent data: use recent_N over the regime (Periods 4\u201320 => N=17) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes a (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility aligned with the lower observed demand, reducing excess holding while preserving service. This also mitigates impact of the likely lost early shipment by relying on recent realized sales rather than initial large samples.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 22 (2019-07-08). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (avg \u224861.1/wk over P4\u2013P18) versus historical samples (~221). On-hand=32, in-transit=409 (large pipeline possibly containing overdue/lost early shipments), but concluded lead-time evidence supports 2-period promised lead time. To avoid overstocking given sustained lower demand, set L to default (promised 2). Use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-changepoint demand mean and volatility (captures Periods 4\u201321 regime), which biases orders down and reduces holding cost while maintaining service under current lower demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained; see history). On-hand=17, in-transit=409 (pipeline large relative to current weekly demand). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2} \u2192 average 1.5; to let the backend infer actual propensity while acknowledging mixed observations I choose to let the backend compute an average from observed lead times. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, capturing Periods 4\u201318 demand behavior so the computed (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std reflect the new lower mean/volatility. This keeps orders conservative given high pipeline and reduces holding risk while maintaining service for the lower-demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 4 (avg ~61.1/week over P4\u2013P18 vs historical sample mean 221), so I use recent-demand estimates. On-hand=6, in-transit=409; one early shipment (P1) appears lost but later arrivals have concluded, so I infer actual lead times vary. L set to calculate (average of observed concluded lead times = 1.5) to reflect observed mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=15 (regime from P4 onward, length=15) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant low-demand regime, keeping inventory small to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while covering review+lead demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Current on-hand=4, in-transit=409. Historical concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2} (avg=1.5) and demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4; use recent data to reflect this. Set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=20 (captures the sustained low-demand regime from Period 4 onward, capped at 20 samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock respond to the new lower mean and volatility while avoiding overstock from stale 2019-01 high samples. This balances service level against the $1 holding cost with $4 profit per unit.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=409 (includes overdue/likely-lost P1=369 and P10=40). Historical concluded lead times: 2,1,1,2 \u2192 average ~1.5. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 4 (Periods 4\u201325 avg \u224861.1 vs historical 221), sustained ~22 periods. To reflect sustained lower demand I use recent demand stats (last 20 periods of the low regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. For lead time I let the OR backend calculate the average observed lead time from concluded messages (captures 1\u20132 variability). These choices reduce target base stock to match the lower-demand regime while letting the backend infer lead-time central tendency; they also avoid over-ordering given the likely-lost shipment still in-transit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been in a much lower regime since Period 4 (avg \u224861/wk vs historical 221). On-hand=0, in-transit=409; earlier missing/lost shipment (P1 369) already noted in carry-over. Use promised lead time (default=2) and base mu/sigma on the recent low-demand regime to avoid overstocking. Select recent_N=20 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (max sensible window capped at 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period demand and variance reflecting the new regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 4 (much lower than 2019 sample mean) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=409; one earlier Period-1 shipment appears lost but later shipments have mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. To reflect confirmed mixed/averaged lead-time behavior I use calculate for L (let backend average observed lead times). To capture the persistent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (uses the most recent 20 demand samples to weight forecast and volatility toward the new low-demand level). This keeps orders conservative (matching lower demand) while acknowledging pipeline stock (409) to avoid overordering and thus lower holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 4 (avg \u224861/week) vs historical sample mean 221. On-hand=0, in-transit=409 \u2014 substantial pipeline. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,1,2] (avg 1.5), suggesting actual LT near 1\u20132. I choose L=recent_N (N=4) to reflect the average of the last 4 observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (use most recent 20 samples from the low regime) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean rather than the historical high mean. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect current lower volatility. These choices prevent the OR engine from overstocking based on old high-demand history while honoring observed pipeline and slightly longer recent lead-time evidence.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 4 (sustained ~61 avg vs historical 221). Observed concluded lead times: P4 (order P2) =2, P8 (P7)=1, P10 (P9)=1, P17 (P15)=2 \u2192 average observed lead time =1.5, but backend 'calculate' will use observed average. To respect the sustained low-demand regime, I set demand estimates using recent samples from the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N over the most recent 20 periods of the low regime to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service appropriate to the lower demand and avoids excess holding cost. L set to calculate so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

I retain promised lead time but use recent demand (most recent regime) to set mu and sigma. Chosen: L=default to keep promised 2-period pipeline for OR engine; mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (use last 20 periods demand to compute (1+L)\xd7mean); sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces overstating demand from early high historical samples and balances service-level vs holding cost given plentiful in-transit inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (carry-over records avg \u224861.1/wk over P4\u2013P18) and recent weeks (P18\u2013P31) remain low (single-digit weekly sales). On-hand=0, in-transit=409 \u2014 pipeline provides multi-week coverage but earlier P1 shipment appears lost (already recorded). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 or 2 periods); I select L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (regime length ~15), so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 15 samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=15 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the low, sustained demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using the averaged lead time and recent volatility, reducing overstock risk given high holding cost relative to profit.

Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained ~61/wk average vs historical 221). On-hand=0, in-transit=409. Promised lead time is 2 and prior concluded arrivals support L=2 (confirmed P2\u2192P4); one early shipment appears lost but not enough to change lead-time default. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime while being robust to recent variability I select recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the most recent 20 demand observations (covers the post-changepoint regime). Use default lead time (promised=2) so the backend and cap calculations remain consistent with contract lead time while our demand forecast uses recent data. This balances service (avoid excess stock given low demand) against holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=409; historical concludes show mixed observed lead times (1 and 2) but sufficient samples to average. Demand regime has been lower since Period 4 (sustained drop); to reflect this I use a recent-window demand estimate. L set to calculate to let backend average observed lead times. mu_hat set to recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint low-demand regime (use the last 20 concluded demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=20 to compute volatility from the same recent window. These choices reduce target base-stock relative to historical highs, limiting overstock given in-transit units and the persistent low-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute exact numeric base_stock and cap.

Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (noted previously) so use recent demand to set forecast. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to let backend reflect actual behavior. For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (reduces target base stock and holding cost exposure) while covering the review+lead period. This balances service (cover small but persistent demand) vs holding cost given on-hand=0 and sizable in-transit. If some in-transit is lost, using a recent lower forecast prevents overstocking.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 4 (much lower than historical Jan samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=409 \u2014 ample pipeline but some past shipments were lost/delayed so use observed lead-time evidence. Set L by averaging observed concluded lead times to reflect actual behavior (mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N over the most recent regime to capture the lower demand level and reduced variability (N=20 to cover the latest sustained pattern while capping window). These choices steer the OR engine to lower target base-stock (reducing holding cost) while reflecting actual lead-time risk.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (carry-over: avg \u224861.1/week over P4\u2013P18, then mostly single-digit weekly demand P19\u2013P36). On-hand=0, in-transit=409 (some earlier shipments showed mixed lead times and at least one lost/overdue shipment historically). I choose L=calculate to let the backend average observed concluded lead times (captures the mixed observed 1\u20132 period arrivals rather than blindly trusting promised). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 20 weeks (captures sustained lower-demand regime and reduces legacy high-sample bias). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=20) to match volatility to recent data. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap order quantities to limit holding costs given low recent demand while still reflecting observed lead-time behavior and the current in-transit inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed 2,1,1,2 \u2192 avg 1.5); I choose to let backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). Demand has clearly fallen and a sustained low-demand regime exists since Period 19; I use a recent_N estimate for demand and volatility using the most recent regime (N=19 weeks: Periods 19\u201337) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current low baseline and reduced variability. This keeps base-stock low to avoid holding cost while meeting modest demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Historical early-sample mean=221 but a sustained demand regime shift was observed (Periods 4\u201338) with much lower weekly demand (~61/wk) across 15+ periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=409 (some past shipments were lost but lead time has been confirmed earlier). Use promised lead time (default) since lead time=2 was previously confirmed and no new sustained lead-time change is observed. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=20) to capture the long, lower-demand regime (use last 20 demand observations to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). Match sigma to the same recent window (recent_N N=20) to reflect current volatility and avoid overweighting the obsolete high-demand early samples. These parameters reduce overstocking risk while maintaining service for the new lower-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained low weekly sales); historical samples (early 2019) are much higher but not reflective of current demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=409; earlier P1 order (369) is likely lost (overdue) per carry-over history, so pipeline contains later arrivals only. I keep L as default (promised = 2) because concluded messages show mixed 1\u20132 arrivals but no new confirmed change requiring override. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to base (1+L)*mean on the most recent 20 weeks to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking. For sigma I also use recent_N (N=20) to capture recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward current low-demand reality, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the observed regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (historic sample mean=221 vs recent much lower weekly sales). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=409 (covers future demand for lead+review). Lead time previously confirmed as 2 periods; no new sustained lead-time evidence so keep promised lead time. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility to focus the last stable regime: choose N=20 (capped at 20, reflects most recent 20 weeks of the low-demand period). This reduces forecasted mu_hat and sigma_hat versus historical full-sample values, avoiding overstock while keeping service given pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand is very low compared with historical samples (last 5 weeks: P37\u2013P41 = 16,4,10,1,2). On-hand=0, in-transit=409 (some earlier shipments were delayed/lost historically). I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded lead-time evidence is mixed but earlier confirmation exists and no new stable lead-time change is confirmed. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the clear low-demand regime in the most recent weeks and to avoid over-ordering given large in-transit stock; this focuses the OR backend on current low mean and volatility and mitigates risk from overdue/lost shipments by not inflating demand forecasts.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 19 (many weeks of single- or low-digit demand); on-hand=0, in-transit=409. There is historical evidence of lead-time variability and a lost shipment earlier, but confirmed lead-time=2 from prior concluded messages. To avoid overstocking against the new low-demand regime, use the promised/default lead time and compute demand forecast from the most recent regime. Set L to default (use promised 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat, target the recent low-demand regime by using recent_N with N=20 (captures the last ~20 weeks since the regime change) so the OR backend will size the base stock to current low demand and reduce holding costs while keeping enough pipeline for the 1+L review+lead period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=409. Historical concluded messages confirm unstable but generally shorter-than-promised arrivals at times, however promised lead time remains our operational contract and recent evidence is mixed \u2014 so use default promised L to keep OR engine aligned. Demand has clearly shifted to a much lower recent regime (sustained low weekly sales since Period 4); to emphasize very recent low demand while still smoothing noise, I set mu_hat using an EWMA (gamma=0.3). Volatility is best captured from recent samples, so I set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect current low-variance regime. These choices reduce over-ordering given large in-transit volume while allowing the OR backend to compute safety stock per its formula.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand regime is low and sustained since Period 4 (avg \u224861/wk over P4\u2013P18 vs historical sample mean 221), so I avoid using the old historical mean. On-hand=0, in-transit=409 (some earlier shipments were lost; current pipeline sizeable). I keep L as default (promised lead time = 2) because concluded messages previously confirmed 2 in some arrivals and no new consistent lead-time change is reliably observed. For demand I use recent_N with N=15 (captures the low-demand regime length of 15 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a much smaller base stock and reduces holding cost risk while maintaining service for current demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=409. Historical conclude messages confirm a sustained low-demand regime since Period 4 (avg \u224861/wk across many periods) and earlier evidence of both 1\u20132 period actual lead times plus a likely lost shipment; no new sustained shifts since the recorded insights. I therefore use the promised lead time (default) so the OR engine uses L=2 as specified, and anchor demand estimates to the recent low-demand regime by using the most recent data (recent_N) to avoid inflation from the old high-demand samples. I choose N=20 (capped rule) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the long, sustained low-demand period and reduce service-level overshoot given holding cost and existing in-transit stock. This approach balances service against holding cost and accounts conservatively for overdue/lost shipments by not inflating forecasts with early historical highs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent history shows a sustained, lower-demand regime since Period 4; on-hand=0, in-transit=409. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132) with some lost shipment evidence, so I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility focus on the most recent 20 demand observations rather than the older high-demand samples. This keeps target base-stock conservative given holding cost vs. profit and leverages the in-transit 409 units to cover upcoming (L+1) periods without overstocking.
