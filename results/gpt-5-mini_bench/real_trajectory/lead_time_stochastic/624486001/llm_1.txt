{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: mid-December; SKU is a basic short-sleeve tee \u2014 seasonally low demand in late-year cold months. Demand analysis: recent weeks show a sustained low-demand regime (Periods 30\u201344 average \u2248 29\u219215 units/week), so expected near-term demand \u2248 15\u201330 units. Lead time / pipeline: promised LT=2 but historical arrivals show variability and many delayed/lost shipments; current in-transit=705 units (large, uncertain). Inventory economics: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is material relative to low weekly demand. With large uncertain pipeline and low expected weekly sales, additional ordering risks heavy holding cost and lowers reward. Action: do not order this period to avoid adding to inventory given ample in-transit stock and weak seasonal demand.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas). Historical pattern and carry-over insights show a sustained late-year low demand regime (Periods 30\u201342 avg \u224829, P43\u2013P45 = 16,15,28). Product is a basic T\u2010shirt (no Xmas-specific spike). Demand forecast: expect continued low weekly demand (~20\u201330 units) for the immediate weeks. Lead time & pipeline: 705 units already in-transit; past history shows variable lead times (1\u20132) and some delayed/lost shipments, but these in-transit units will likely deliver over coming weeks. Inventory economics: profit = $4/unit, holding = $1/unit/period. With near-term low demand, ordering now risks high holding costs on large pipeline. Decision rule: do not add inventory while a large pipeline exists and demand is low. Order 0 to avoid excess holding cost and allow in-transit inventory to absorb demand.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-30 is end-of-year; carry-over notes a confirmed late-year low demand regime. Demand analysis: recent weeks (P43\u2013P46) show very low demand (~15\u201328 units/week); expect continued low post-Christmas demand. Lead time / pipeline: In-transit = 705 units; recent history shows mixed lead-time but many earlier large shipments eventually arrived (e.g., P6\u2192P8, P7\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14, P15/P16\u2192P17), so assume some or all of the 705 will arrive within a few periods. Inventory assessment: on-hand=0, in-transit >> expected short-term demand. Forecast & order logic: target coverage L+1=3 periods; estimated demand ~25/week \u2192 target \u224875 units. With 705 already in-transit, placing additional order would create unnecessary holding costs ($1/unit/period) and reduce reward. Final decision: place no order this period.",
