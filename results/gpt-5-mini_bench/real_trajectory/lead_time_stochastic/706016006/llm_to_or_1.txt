Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly samples available through 2019-02-04; no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. No sustained demand or lead-time regime change detected, so use defaults (promised L=2 and demand/volatility aggregated over all samples) to let the OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding unsupported manual adjustments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand 0, in-transit 225 (order placed Period 1). Promised lead time is 2; the P1 order should arrive during Period 3 and will be visible in Period 3 conclude. No concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lead-time change or lost shipment. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean \u2248101.2; I'll use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps the base-stock grounded in full-sample demand while the in-transit 225 covers part of upcoming demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=455 (orders from P1/P2 not yet concluded). Promised lead time=2; concluded messages show no arrivals yet but those P1/P2 orders would only conclude after their arrival (P1 order will conclude at end of P3 and be observed in Period 4), so there is no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipment yet. Use default lead time to respect promised L=2. Demand history (five weekly samples) yields baseline mean; use default demand/volatility (all-samples) scaled by (1+L) to produce mu_hat and sqrt(1+L) scaling for sigma_hat. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to historical average demand over the review+lead horizon while avoiding overreacting to pending but unconcluded shipments. If shipments fail to conclude in future periods, I'll switch to explicit/recent_N lead-time methods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent on-demand has risen vs older samples: Period1-3 demands = 184, 216, 149 (recent mean 183) vs historical sample mean 101.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=503 but no arrivals have been concluded: orders placed P1(225), P2(230), P3(48) all show arrived=0 in their conclude messages \u2192 strong evidence shipments are delayed or lead time > promised. To protect service level against continued high recent demand and delayed arrivals, I explicitly increase lead time and use a recent_N demand estimate (N=3) so mu_hat covers review+lead demand based on the last 3 observed demands. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to avoid stockouts given overdue shipments while recognizing holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4).

Carry-over insight: Confirmed missing/delayed shipments: orders placed P1(225), P2(230), P3(48) all arrived=0 in conclude messages (no arrivals by P3) \u2014 suggests actual lead time >2 or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $565.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded history shows one observed lead-time: order on Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). On-hand=71, in-transit=512. Profit=$4, holding=$1 (q=4/(4+1)=0.8) so backend should target high service level. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (2). With L from data, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages historical demand (including the large late-Feb spikes) while letting the backend produce base-stock and cap consistent with profit/holding tradeoff. This approach keeps orders conservative given substantial in-transit inventory and confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order on Period 2 arrived in Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=512 (pipeline present). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime (periods 1-5 demands: 184,216,149,159,151). Prior concern about missing shipments was resolved: lead time confirmed as 2 (order P2 arrived P4). Use promised lead time (default). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 periods) and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This focuses safety stock and ordering on the recent observed demand pattern while relying on confirmed lead time=2 to avoid underordering after earlier delays.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=557. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (order on P2 arrived in P4) and earlier missing arrivals appear episodic. Recent demand regime is ~150-216/week (Periods 1-6 demands: 184,216,149,159,151,159) so I use a recent-N forecast to capture current higher mean/volatility. Set L=default to use promised (and confirmed) 2-period lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L)-period demand mean and std on the six most recent observations, ensuring orders cover the review+lead horizon while reflecting current demand and controlling holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand stabilized around ~150 units/week (Periods 3-7: 149,159,151,159,153; mean\u2248154.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=557 (covers multiple review+lead periods). Historical early spikes exist but last 5 periods form a stable regime. Lead-time evidence (Period 4 conclude) confirms a 2-period actual lead time; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times (will yield 2). Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to target the current regime: (1+L)*mean of last 5 periods \u2192 better matches recent demand and avoids overreacting to early spikes. Set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices balance service (cover ~3 periods of ~154 demand) against holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-08. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 (orders P2->P4, P6->P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=512 (pipeline large but arrivals will be visible only in future concludes). Demand recent periods (P4..P8 = 159,151,159,153,205) show a moderately elevated and variable regime vs earlier weeks; I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current demand level and volatility while using observed lead time. Choices: L set to calculate (avg observed lead times = 2) to match confirmed arrivals; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to base (1+L)-period demand on last 5 realized demands (captures the recent spike at P8); sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters aim to raise base stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping variability-driven safety stock reasonable given holding cost.

Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=529. Historical concluded lead times show consistent 2-period arrivals (P2->P4, P6->P8), so use calculated lead time. Demand recent history (Periods 5-9: 151,159,153,205,165) shows no sustained regime shift but recent up-tick (205); I use recent_N=5 to capture current level. mu_hat and sigma_hat use the last 5 demand samples (multiplied by (1+L) internally).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand (Periods 5-10) is elevated and stable around ~150-200 units/week; last 6 demands = [151,159,153,205,165,121], mean \u2248159. On-hand=0, in-transit=516 (sufficient pipeline but prior periods showed delayed arrivals; concluded lead times observed = [2,2,1]). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures mixture but reflects majority=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent higher-demand regime rather than older low winter samples. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=6) to reflect current demand variability. These choices bias base-stock up to cover the sustained higher demand while using observed lead-time data to avoid systematic underordering from past delays.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand is elevated and volatile (many weeks 120\u2013205), historical early-Jan low samples (20\u2013191) are not representative. Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P8:2, P10:1} \u2192 average \u22481.67 so use backend 'calculate' to let it compute avg observed lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=517 (large pipeline) \u2014 keep forecast focused on recent demand to avoid understock if some in-transit are lost. Use recent_N=10 for mu and sigma to capture the most recent high-demand regime and its volatility; this balances service level vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=525. Historical concluded lead times: observed 2 (P2->P4), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P9->P10) \u2014 majority support ~2 but with one 1, so use overall average to reflect mixed evidence. Recent demand (Periods 8-12 = 205,165,121,119,150) centers ~152; I use the last 5 periods to capture current regime and avoid dilution by very old samples. Choices: L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat='recent_N' N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and adapt to current demand level; sigma_hat='recent_N' N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise target stock to cover current higher weekly demand while the averaged lead time hedges against occasional 2-period delays and some lost/delayed shipments.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent demand history (Periods 4\u201313) shows a sustained high-demand regime (~120\u2013205/week) after early low periods; observed concluded lead times are mostly 2 (three 2s and one 1). To capture the true lead-time central tendency use calculate (average of observed lead times). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime (covers Periods 4\u201313). Match sigma to recent variability with recent_N N=10. These settings raise base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while relying on observed lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering given past delayed arrivals.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has been consistently high (~120-205/week) since Period 3; earlier low-Jan samples (20,36) represent a different regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=516 (large pipeline) \u2014 some early shipments were delayed/lost but concludes from P4,P8,P10,P13,P14 show actual lead times mostly 2 (one 1); average observed \u22481.8. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to let the backend account for realized variability. For demand I use a recent_N regime to focus the forecast on the sustained high-demand period (N=12 covering Periods 3\u201314) so mu_hat reflects current demand, and sigma_hat recent_N with same N to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce understock risk given higher recent demand while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend's service-level cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=516. Recent concluded lead-times: {P2->P4:2, P6->P8:2, P9->P10:1, P11->P13:2, P12->P14:2} (avg \u22481.8) so I let backend compute average (calculate). Recent demand regime is high and stable (~119,150,138,136,160 over last 5 concluded periods), so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture current elevated demand ((1+L) multiplier will be applied by backend). Volatility should reflect recent variability, so sigma_hat recent_N=5. This balances service (captures current high demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline; using recent data avoids diluting with early low-Jan samples.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent observed demands (Periods 12-16) average ~140 units/week with moderate variability; pipeline shows 516 units in-transit and on-hand=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods in prior concludes, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime versus the sparse Jan samples, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the last 5 demand samples to anchor forecast and volatility to the current regime and avoid dilution by early low-demand weeks. This balances higher service (capture current ~140 mean) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

I use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times (captures mix of 1\u20132 periods while acknowledging past losses). For demand I select 'default' for mu_hat and 'default' for sigma_hat so the backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L); this balances using full-sample demand evidence with the inferred lead-time, avoiding overreacting to recent zeros while keeping service levels given profit vs holding cost tradeoff.

Recent demand (Periods 15-19 = 160,115,86,121,78) is materially lower than earlier spikes \u2192 detect a regime shift to lower demand; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on current lower-demand regime. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the recent lower demand while accounting for observed lead-time behavior and the sizable in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical conclude messages show intermittent missing arrivals early but multiple confirmed arrivals imply actual lead time ~2 (several observed 2-period arrivals, one 1-period). Pipeline (516) is large relative to recent weekly demand (typically ~100-200/week) so maintain demand-driven forecasts but use observed lead-time information. Choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect measured behavior; use default demand stats for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history. This balances service (accounting for realized lead time) versus holding cost given a large existing pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weekly demand has been low-to-moderate (multiple weeks with demand 58\u2013160; historical early-2019 spikes existed). On-hand=0, in-transit=516 \u2014 substantial pipeline available but arrivals are only visible after conclude messages; past concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period actual lead time with occasional 1-period. Several early orders were delayed but later concludes confirm lead_time=2 is typical. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed predominance of 2). For demand and volatility I use defaults so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this is conservative given mixed demand and large pipeline. These settings balance service (use observed lead time) while avoiding overreacting to recent noise or transient delays.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concluded lead times are predominantly 2 periods (multiple confirms: P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14) with one 1-period outlier (P9\u2192P10); earlier periods showed delayed/missing arrivals but lead time has since been confirmed as 2. Recent demand has declined versus early spikes; last 5 weekly demands = [146,111,106,58,63] (mean \u2248 96.8). To balance service level vs holding cost while respecting promised lead time and recent lower demand, I keep L at the promised default (2), and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 samples (recent_N=5) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*recent mean. I also use recent_N=5 for sigma to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to current demand and avoids overstocking given prior missing/late shipments and a confirmed L=2.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=516 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages show multiple confirmed lead_time=2 arrivals (e.g., P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13, P12->P14) and occasional isolated 1-period arrival; overall recent pattern supports promised L=2. Demand has shifted down from early high spikes (Periods 3-5) to a steadier ~100-140 range from Periods 15-26. I detect a changepoint into the lower-demand regime starting ~Period 15 (regime length = 12 periods: P15\u2013P26). To reflect the recent lower mean and volatility, I use recent_N with N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std over the latest stable regime; keeping L as default (promised) leverages confirmed 2-period behavior while letting mu/sigma reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and the large existing pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent weeks show ongoing demand ~100\u2013150/wk; on-hand=0, in-transit=516. Historical concluded lead-time observations cluster at 2 periods (Period 5 confirmed L=2) despite some earlier single-period arrivals\u2014no sustained lead-time increase. In-transit (516) comfortably covers (1+L)=3 periods of demand using historical mean (~101.2), so risk of stockout from pipeline is low. I therefore keep L at the promised/default to let the OR engine assume promised lead time=2, and use default demand/volatility calculations (all samples) so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (pipeline > needed cover) against holding costs given the large in-transit quantity.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=516 \u2014 there are substantial units in pipeline but none visible yet. Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times (some 1-period noise); earlier missing arrivals were later resolved and Period 5 confirmed lead time=2. I therefore accept the promised lead time and let the OR engine compute demand stats from the full sample set. Using default L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat lets the backend apply its capped base-stock policy with the promised L=2 while balancing profit vs holding cost given the observed demand history and current in-transit volume.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/09/02 (Period 30). Recent concluded history shows repeated weekly demand samples (see history) with long run of zero on-hand and sporadic arrivals; current on-hand=0, in-transit=516 (large pipeline). Earlier missing arrivals were later resolved and lead time has been confirmed as 2 in past concludes. I will use the promised lead time (default) so the OR backend uses L=2; use default demand and volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all historical samples ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) and let the capped policy control order size against pipeline. This avoids overreacting to transient delays while the large in-transit (516) is expected to cover upcoming demand for multiple periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) = [2,2,1,2,2] \u2192 avg \u22481.8 \u22482, so use calculate to let backend set L from observed data. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); this leverages full historical demand (including early high weeks) while the calculated L captures the confirmed ~2-period lead time. This balances service level (capturing lead-time evidence) vs holding cost by relying on backend's base-stock logic with the observed lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=516. History of concluded arrivals indicates actual lead time \u22482 (several orders observed with lead_time=2); recent two weeks show high demand (282,289) but not a sustained regime shift (needs \u22653 periods). To be conservative and consistent with concluded lead-time evidence, set L via calculate (average observed lead times) so backend learns confirmed lead time. Use default demand and volatility estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat default) because no validated persistent demand regime change; this keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to full-sample statistics while letting lead-time inference adjust replenishment timing given overdue/lost shipments history.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has risen sharply in Sep (Periods 28-32: 139, 162, 282, 289, 266) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=516. Historical concludes show actual lead time has often been 2 (confirmed P2->P4, P6->P8, etc.) so use promised lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) so the OR backend targets service for the current elevated demand while keeping variability estimated from the same window. This balances avoiding stockouts during the Sep spike versus holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent weeks show a large demand spike beginning early Sept; on-hand=0, in-transit=787 (large pipeline from prior orders, some arrivals delayed historically). Historical concluded arrivals indicate typical observed lead times around 2 periods (with occasional 1); given concluded evidence I use calculated average lead time. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples to capture the recent spike and overall variability while respecting the promised lead-time model. These parameters balance service (address recent surge) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike starting Period 30 (2019-09-02): avg demand P30-33 = 323 vs avg P26-29 = 140 (+131%).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=787. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = promised 2 periods (observed P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, etc.). Demand regime shifted starting Period 30 (2019-09-02) with elevated weekly demand: P30-33 avg=323 vs prior P26-29 avg=140 (+131%). To capture the new high-demand regime, set L to default (promised 2). Forecast demand using recent_N over the new regime: use the last 4 weeks (Periods 30-33) so mu_hat uses recent_N N=4. Volatility also reflects the recent regime, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4. This raises the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while preserving the backend's lead-time assumption and limiting excessive inventory by using a short recent window.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=1082. Historical concludes show most observed lead times = 2 periods (few 1s) so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer (~2). Demand regime shift starting Period 30 (2019-09-02) increased mean substantially; use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to capture the post-changepoint regime. Chosen N=6 (periods 30\u201335) because regime length = 6; N constrained between 3 and 20. These choices ensure mu_hat reflects the recent elevated demand while L=calculate lets backend use observed lead-time history; sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility so base-stock sizing balances higher service level during spike against holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent history shows a sustained demand spike starting Period 30 (avg P30-33 >> prior periods). On-hand=408, in-transit=516 so pipeline is substantial. Lead times observed in concluded messages vary (observed lead_times: 2,2,1,2,2,3,1); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 (uses most recent 7 demand samples covering the post-spike regime) and set sigma_hat to recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base stock to cover elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N keeps safety stock tuned to recent variability; using calculate for L prevents committing to the promised lead time when historical concluded lead times vary. Pipeline + on-hand will reduce the immediate order size, avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 30 (Sept 2) with higher weekly demand; last 8 periods (P30\u2013P37) demands = [282,289,266,455,246,246,158,182]. Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2,2,3,1} \u2192 average ~1.86; use calculated average rather than default to capture small variation. On-hand=226 + in-transit=555 = 781 units in pipeline; choosing mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent high-demand regime (most relevant for service level) while L from calculated observed lead times balances risk of underestimated arrival delays. Methods chosen: L=calculate to reflect observed lead-time sample average; mu_hat recent_N (N=8) to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the recent elevated regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility. This raises target base stock to better cover the sustained spike while keeping holding cost in mind (profit=$4, holding=$1 informs backend z*).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent data shows a sustained demand spike starting Period 30 (avg P30-38 \u2248256), while pipeline is large (in-transit=662, on-hand=87). Observed lead times have varied (1\u20133), average ~1.75 \u2014 use calculated average to reflect actual behavior. To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent spike regime (N=9, Periods 30\u201338). This balances higher target stocking for elevated demand while letting the OR backend cap orders using its cap calculation to limit over-ordering given large pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=810. Historical concluded lead times are variable (observed 1,2 and one 3); several orders experienced delays or longer than promised arrivals. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 30 (2019-09-02); recent periods (P30\u2013P39) show consistently higher demand vs earlier. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability seen in concluded messages). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (use last 10 samples covering the elevated-demand regime P30\u2013P39) so mu_hat targets the current higher-demand regime across review+lead. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=10 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices increase target base stock to serve the elevated demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and limiting overstock risk by using recent regime statistics.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (avg P30-33 = 323 vs P26-29 = 140). On-hand=0, in-transit=868 \u2014 sizable pipeline but past shipments showed variable/occasionally delayed lead times (observed lead times: 1\u20133). To capture the higher post-Period-30 demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples from the new high-demand regime (use recent_N over the last 11 periods since the changepoint). For lead time I use recent_N over the most recent observed lead-time samples (N=5) to reflect variability (1\u20133) rather than blindly trusting the promised L=2; this helps the OR backend size orders to cover (1+L) periods of the new demand while accounting for recent lead-time variability and avoiding excess holding given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=720. Historical conclues show mixed lead times (1,2,3) but recent behaviour centers near 2; several early missing shipments were later resolved. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 30. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20133 variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to focus the forecast on the post-Period-30 higher-demand regime; same N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices raise target base stock to cover the sustained higher demand while reflecting observed lead-time variability and limiting excess holding cost given available pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=826. Historical concluded lead times show variability but average \u22481.78 (observed W: 2,2,1,2,2,3,1,1,2) \u2014 close to promised 2 but with occasional 3-period delays and some earlier missing arrivals. Demand regime: sustained spike beginning Period 30 (avg P30-33 =323 vs P26-29 =140); recent 13-week window (P30-42) captures the higher demand environment including the recent Black Friday surge. I set L using 'calculate' to let the backend use the empirical average observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts across (1+L) periods using the elevated recent demand mean and volatility, improving service during this sustained higher-demand regime while controlling holding cost by restricting to recent volatility estimate.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=868. Recent history shows a sustained demand spike beginning Period 30 (avg P30-33=323 vs prior P26-29=140, +131%), and lead times have been variable (observed 1\u20133). Pipeline (868) is large relative to current weekly demand but arrivals have been irregular historically; using an empirical average lead time helps the OR backend account for observed variability. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I focus on the post-changepoint high-demand regime starting Period 30 and use recent_N with N=14 (regime length ~14 periods from P30\u2013P43) so mu_hat reflects elevated demand; same recent_N (N=14) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet the confirmed higher demand while using observed lead-time averaging to temper over-ordering given arrival variability.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=899. Recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 170,171,506,110,113; avg=214) due to the Sept spike carrying through into higher variance. Lead times have varied historically (observed Ls include 1,2,3) so I use a short recent average to reflect current supplier performance. I set L via recent_N=5 (captures last 5 observed lead-times, avg \u22482.0). I set demand forecast (mu_hat) using recent_N=5 to weight the high recent mean (backend will compute (1+L)*mean). I set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This combination keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent demand spike while the large in-transit (899) will be offset by the capped order rule; using recent samples reduces risk from stale low-demand history and helps maintain a high service level (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.8) without excessive long-term overstock given holding cost.

Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 30 (avg P30-33 and later elevated weeks). On-hand=111, in-transit=693 (pipeline large). Recent observed lead times vary but no new sustained deviation since prior confirmation; use promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 30-45, length 16) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility reflecting the elevated demand while L=default keeps lead-time as promised. This balances higher service level for the new demand pattern against holding cost given already-large pipeline inventory.

Demand regime shift (spike) previously recorded starting Period 30, but current pipeline is ample to cover elevated demand. I choose to let the backend use the empiric average lead time (calculate) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level given large pipeline while avoiding extra manual tuning now.
