Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & pipeline: Concluded history shows multiple late/unconcluded shipments earlier and game-provided carry-over notes flag unreliable pipeline; current 'In-transit=2083' may include delayed/lost orders but many recent conclude messages show no new arrivals (Periods 35\u201346 arrivals have been accounted and no recent outstanding concludes), so I will treat visible on-hand=140 as the trusted immediate supply. Demand outlook: Recent weekly demand (Periods 40\u201346) averaged ~193 but has trended down in December (Periods 42\u201346: 506,110,113,95,75 \u2014 spike then drop; last three weeks 113,95,75 average ~94). Profit vs holding: profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 high critical fractile (q=0.8) favors availability, but holding cost is material and OR baseline (which uses promised L=2 and full history) recommends 0. Risk tradeoff: with uncertain in-transit reliability and sufficient on-hand to cover at least one low-demand week (~94) and avoid incurring more holding cost over the holiday lull, I decline to order now. Execution: Follow OR recommendation of 0 units to avoid adding risk to inventory while monitoring upcoming conclude messages for actual arrivals and confirmed lead-time shifts before placing replenishment.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order (follow OR): On-hand 140 covers near-term subdued December demand; in-transit reliability is questionable and holding cost is significant, so avoid adding inventory until arrivals/lead-time are reconfirmed.",
