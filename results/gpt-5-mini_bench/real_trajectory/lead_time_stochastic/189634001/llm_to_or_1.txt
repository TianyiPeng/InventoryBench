Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 52.8 units/week and no evidence of a sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and promised lead time is 2 periods. I use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand uncertainty: mu_hat default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the OR backend anchored to historical average demand while avoiding premature adjustments given limited data and no confirmed lead-time shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent historical weekly demand (5 samples) has mean 52.8 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=62 (order placed P1 not yet arrived in P2 conclude -> possible delay but insufficient evidence to confirm lead-time change). Use promised lead time (default L=2) and population-based demand estimates so OR backend applies its standard safety stock. This keeps ordering responsive to historical baseline while avoiding premature escalation for a single delayed shipment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical demand samples (weekly Jan\u2013Feb 2019) have mean \u224852.8 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=233 which exceeds (1+L)*mean under promised L=2, so pipeline appears sufficient for the next review+lead periods. No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 and 2 orders not expected to conclude until Period 3 and 4), so there is no evidence to adjust promised lead time or demand regime. Use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility with promised lead time=2, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand stable (five samples mean=52.8/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=233 but none of prior orders have concluded (orders from P1,P2,P3 show arrived=0). The P1 order (62) should have concluded by Period 3 if promised L=2 but did not, indicating lead time >2 or lost shipments. To be conservative and ensure pipeline covers upcoming periods, I set L explicitly to 3 (assume longer lead time). Given stable historical demand, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with the chosen L. This increases target base stock to protect service level given suspected delays while keeping volatility estimates unchanged.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed P1 (62 units) and P2 (171 units) failed to arrive by their expected conclude periods (arrived=0); evidence suggests actual lead time >2 or lost shipments\u2014treat as extended lead time/lost shipments until confirmed.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
189634001: ordered=67, arrived=171 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=171, demand=50, sold=50, ending on-hand inventory=121
Daily Profit: $50.00, Daily Holding Cost: $121.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $-71.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent concludes show a mixed arrival pattern: P2 order (171) arrived in Period 4 with observed lead_time=2; P1 order (62) remains missing. Current on-hand=121, in-transit=129. Given the confirmed observation of a 2-period lead time (P2->P4) and limited contradictory evidence, set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to let backend use empirical lead-time data. Demand history (five weekly samples mean=52.8) suggests using the default demand aggregation: mu_hat default = (1+L)*mean(all samples) so the OR engine captures the long-run average across the review+lead period. Use default sigma_hat to let the engine compute volatility from all samples. These choices (calculate L; default mu_hat and sigma_hat) reflect confirmed lead-time evidence while relying on the historical demand sample to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each). They also avoid overreacting to one missing shipment (P1) while the P2 arrival confirms typical L=2 behavior. If P1 remains missing in future concludes, treat as lost and revisit L explicitly.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 ordered on Period 2 arrived on Period 4). Order from Period 1 (62 units) remains missing by Period 4 conclude\u2014likely lost shipment.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent realized demand (Periods 3-5 = 57,50,60) is stable ~56/wk; Period 1 (201) was an outlier caused by early stockouts/lost shipment and should not drive the forecast. On-hand=61 + in-transit=129 provides ~190 units available over the next weeks. Observed concluded lead time samples show lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4); use calculated lead time=2. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent stable regime (last 3 periods) to avoid overreacting to the P1 spike while matching current demand variability. This balances service (cover ~3 periods demand given L=2) against holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=13, in-transit=129. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = promised 2 periods (P2 ordered P2 arrived P4) and one earlier shipment likely lost; recent demands (P4-P6 = 50,60,48) align with historical mean ~53. Given no sustained demand regime shift and confirmed LT=2, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (covering 3 periods of demand) against holding cost while treating missing P1 shipment as an isolated loss.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=194. History shows one confirmed lead time=2 (P2\u2192arrived P4) and one likely lost shipment (P1 order never concluded). Pipeline (194) plus on-hand should cover upcoming demand; no new sustained seasonality detected. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed 2). Demand has shifted up slightly vs. early-2019 baseline, so I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the last 6 realized demands (Periods 2\u20137 excluding the extreme Period1 spike). I set sigma_hat recent_N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward recent demand while using confirmed lead-time evidence, helping balance service level against holding cost given possible lost shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent realized lead times: observed arrivals show L=2 (P2\u2192P4) and L=1 (P7\u2192P8) with one lost P1 shipment; variability but no clear permanent shift\u2014use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 4\u20138 = 50,60,48,73,69) avg=60; P1 (201) is an outlier likely due to early data anomaly. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current ~50\u201370 regime. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of expected demand) versus holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each) by tightening estimates around recent demand and letting OR backend compute safety stock via its q ratio.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=180. History shows variable actual lead times (observed 2 from P2->P4 and 1 from P7->P8) and at least one likely lost shipment (P1 order never concluded). To balance service vs holding cost I set L by averaging the two most recent observed lead times to capture lead-time variability (recent_N N=2). Demand appears lower after the large outlier in Period1; I use the last 5 demand periods to estimate mean and volatility (recent_N N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent regime and reduce influence of early outlier. These parameters aim to maintain coverage for (1+L) periods while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variance and avoiding excessive holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=10, in-transit=129. Historical arrivals show variable actual lead times: earlier P2\u2192P4 was 2, but the two most recent concluded arrivals (P7\u2192P8 and P9\u2192P10) had lead_time=1, suggesting lead time has shortened recently. Demand recent window (Periods 6-10 demands = 48,73,69,46,41) averages ~55.4. To reflect the recent shorter lead time and recent demand regime while keeping some smoothing, I set L using recent observed lead times (last 2) to capture the most recent shift to 1 period; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=5 to base the forecast on the most recent demand regime (multiplied by 1+L by backend). This balances service level (capture recent demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

There is prior evidence of a lost P1 shipment but more recent arrivals show mostly 1\u20132 period lead times. To balance service vs holding cost, I use a short estimated lead time based on the last 3 observed lead times (recent_N=3) so the OR engine won't overstock for a presumed long delay; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults (all-sample stats scaled by 1+L) so the backend computes demand over the review+lead horizon consistently with the chosen L.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Historical weekly demand mean \u224852.8 (samples: 54,60,52,52,46). On-hand=0, in-transit=192. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P7->P8), 1 (P9->P10) \u2014 variable; use calculated average lead time to capture recent variability. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. Pipeline (192) appears sufficient against (1+L)\xd7mean for the likely L, while default mu/sigma keep service-level tradeoff consistent given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/5/13 (Period 14). Recent demand has softened vs Jan samples (most recent 5 concluded demands = 46,41,37,45,31 \u2192 avg\u224840). On-hand=0, in-transit=164 (pipeline large vs current demand). Observed concluded lead times vary (recent observed lead times: P7\u2192P8=1, P9\u2192P10=1, P11\u2192P13=2) \u2014 short-term average \u22481.33. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1) I select a slightly conservative short-run lead time estimate (recent average of last 3 observed lead times) and downweight old January samples by using the most recent 5 demand observations for mu and sigma. This reduces forecast bias from the older high-Jan series while keeping safety for lead-time variability. Using recent_N for sigma captures current volatility. No explicit adjustments for suspected lost shipments here because lead-time evidence in recent concludes shows deliveries within 1\u20132 periods.

Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=129. Recent concludes show mixed actual lead times (observed 1 and 2 periods) with prior evidence of a lost shipment from P1; overall signal favors using the empirical average lead time rather than the promised fixed value. I select L="calculate" to let the backend average observed lead times from concluded history. Demand context: historical weekly demands range ~31\u201373 recently (earlier Jan samples 46\u201360); I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as "default" so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given the inferred lead time and the risk of delayed/lost shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent concluded history shows observed lead times = {P4:2 (P2), P8:1, P10:1, P13:2, P14:2} \u2192 average \u22481.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=181 (pipeline covers upcoming demand partially but one early order likely lost). Demand samples (historical weekly mean \u224852.8) are stable around ~53 units/week. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding so q=0.5 \u2192 moderate safety stock), set L to be calculated from observed lead times (uses empirical average), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this leverages full sample history while letting backend apply the calculated lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but majority ~2 in recent windows; on-hand=0, in-transit=181 (several past orders outstanding; P1 likely lost per prior insight). I choose L recent_N (N=5) to let the backend compute the average of the last 5 observed lead times (captures recent variability 1\u20132). Demand has shifted recently (last 5 demands = P12\u2013P16: 45,31,45,60,54) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent regime. Volatility likewise estimated from the same recent window, so sigma_hat recent_N (N=5). These settings focus replenishment on the newest demand pattern while letting the backend incorporate the averaged recent lead time to balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Recent demand (last 5 sold/demand periods = 31,45,60,54,34; mean=44.8) used to scale (1+L) demand forecast to capture current regime; use same recent window for volatility. These settings raise target base-stock to cover (L+1) periods of recently observed demand while acknowledging some shipments were delayed/lost in earlier periods (we rely only on concluded arrivals to set L).

On-hand=0, in-transit=129; earlier P1 shipment remains missing (likely lost) but several later orders have concluded with LT=2. I choose to let backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate) to reflect the recent mix. For demand I use default (1+L)\xd7mean of all available historical samples (conservative use of full-sample mean given no sustained demand regime shift). Volatility also default to reflect full-sample variability. These choices balance service (using observed average LT) against holding cost by not inflating forecasts without clear sustained demand increase.

Recent realized lead times have varied (1 and 2 periods) with several 2-period arrivals in the last months; use the average observed lead time to let backend reconcile variability. Recent demand has softened versus early-season levels: last 5 concluded demands = [60,54,34,32,30] \u2192 mean ~42; with on-hand=0 and in-transit=173 we should size forecast to recent demand. Choose recent 5-sample demand estimates to reflect the lower recent sales and use recent-5 volatility so the OR engine targets service while limiting inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

I therefore keep L at the promised/default to let the backend use historical observed lead times, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (profit=holding so profit/ (profit+holding)=0.5 \u2192 moderate service level) while avoiding overreacting to intermittent lost/delayed shipments.

One early shipment (P1) remains missing (likely lost) but later shipments have largely arrived with average \u22481.67.

I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given modest demand history and uncertain/mixed lead-time evidence.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has shifted down from 50-60 range to ~30-34 over the last 6 periods (Periods 17-22), a sustained regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=173; some early orders were lost/delayed but later concludes show actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods. I set L to be calculated from all observed conclude lead times to reflect measured variability (avg ~1.67). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect current volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the sustained lower demand while allowing the OR engine to account for observed lead-time variability and the existing in-transit stock.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u22482 (multiple P\u2192P+2 observations) though occasional P+1 occurred and some early lost shipment(s) were observed. Recent weekly demand (last 5-10 weeks) shows no sustained regime shift\u2014spikes (50) are isolated. To be conservative and align with confirmed lead time, use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance across the (1+L) review+lead window. This balances service (using confirmed LT=2) against holding cost without overreacting to isolated spikes or missing shipments.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weekly demand has been mostly in the 28\u201350 range with several zero-sales periods due to stockouts; on-hand=0, in-transit=173 which should cover multiple weeks given typical demand. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1\u20132 periods and recent confirms of 2, so I will use the promised lead time. Use default demand estimates (all samples) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std, letting it balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding. This is conservative given potential lost shipments noted earlier but not newly confirmed.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=173. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time \u22482 for multiple arrivals; several earlier shipments were delayed/lost but lead time now matches promised 2. Demand history shows no sustained regime shift since samples provided. Using promised lead time keeps OR backend aligned with observed confirmed lead time; default mu/sigma let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples so orders will cover the review+lead demand while balancing profit vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand samples (historical weekly data through Period 26) show stable weekly demand with no new sustained regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=173 \u2014 pipeline is sizable and likely covers upcoming demand; earlier carry-over noted a lost shipment (P1) and confirmed lead_time=2 from P2->P4. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed concluded lead times (captures mix of 1 and 2 period arrivals). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping forecasts conservative and letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=173. Historical conclues show mixed lead times but lead time was confirmed as 2 in prior evidence; one early shipment (P1) appears lost but later behavior is consistent with promised L=2. Demand history shows no sustained upward/downward regime since samples are seasonal-stable. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and avoid overfitting to recent noise or suspected lost shipments, I select default methods so backend uses promised L and full-sample demand moments: L=default to assume promised 2-period lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples are used. This balances service level (using full-history mean) against holding cost and avoids chasing transient missing arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=173. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W = 2,1,1,2,2,2 \u2192 avg \u22481.67) and prior evidence of a lost shipment (Period 1). To be conservative about real lead time variability, set L using calculate (backend avg of observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) from the provided historical demand samples; this leverages the full sample mean while letting the backend incorporate the inferred lead time and service-level tradeoff given equal profit/holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods (observed lead times: 2,1,1,2,2,2); recent evidence supports using an estimated average lead time rather than forcing promised value. Demand history (weeks in dataset) shows no sustained regime shift since samples are stable around ~50s. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend infers the average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to keep forecasts grounded in full history. This balances service level (by using inferred lead time) against holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=173. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = promised 2 periods (multiple orders observed with LT=2) and earlier single missing shipment appears lost; recent history shows many stockouts but no sustained demand regime shift (insufficient 3+ periods of elevated demand independent of stockouts). Therefore use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps estimates conservative given censoring and lets the backend trade service level vs. holding cost using its calibrated q.

Historical conclude messages have confirmed actual lead time = 2 in prior periods and one earlier shipment appears lost, but no new sustained lead-time or demand regime shifts in recent weeks. I choose default lead time (use promised 2) and default demand uncertainty methods so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the policy conservative given limited on-hand stock and a large in-transit balance, avoiding overadjustment from short-term noise.

I will let the backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (method=calculate) to capture the 1\u20132 period variability. For demand, I'll use default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), preserving the historical demand signal rather than overfitting to recent noise. This balances service (uses observed lead-time mean) vs holding cost (uses full-sample demand estimates) given uncertain/missing shipments.

Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods and some lost shipments earlier; no new sustained lead-time change since Period 5 confirmed L=2. In-transit stock (173) should cover multiple periods of demand; to avoid overreacting to sporadic lost shipments and mixed short/long arrivals, use the promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its historical mean/variance across the (1+L) review+lead window.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Recent observed demand has increased and become more volatile since late Sep (Period 33 demand=109, then several weeks of 54\u201383\u201364\u201342), on-hand=0 with in-transit=173. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 in earlier evidence. One early shipment (P1, 62 units) remains missing and treated as lost; current pipeline (173) is the only incoming stock. To capture the recent higher mean and volatility, I use recent_N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 7 demand samples to reflect the post-changepoint regime). L uses default (promised lead time = 2). These parameters bias orders to cover (1+L) periods of the recent higher-demand regime while reflecting increased variance to improve service with limited holding cost tradeoff.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=202. History shows actual lead time has oscillated but was confirmed as 2 periods for recent confirmed arrival; one early shipment likely lost. Given available data (small sample history provided) and no clear sustained demand regime change, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculation. This keeps parameters conservative while the in-transit 202 units will be valued by the backend when computing pipeline; default settings avoid overfitting to short-term noise or missing-shipment anomalies.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent observed demand is elevated and variable (Periods 35-39 demands = 83,64,42,43,49; recent mean 56.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=202 units. Use promised lead time (default L=2) because recent conclude messages have confirmed lead time = 2 and missing older shipments were already flagged; rely on recent demand for forecast. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples) so the base-stock reflects current demand spike; set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility for safety stock. These choices prioritize meeting demand spikes while avoiding excessive hold given equal profit/holding (q=0.5 implies z*=0), and they use the most relevant recent demand evidence while keeping L at the promised/confirmed value.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=202. Historical concluded lead times observed = {P4:2, P8:1, P10:1, P13:2, P14:2, P17:2} -> average \u22481.67 with dominant mode 2; earlier carry-over noted one likely lost shipment (P1). To reflect observed lead-time behavior I choose L by averaging observed lead times (method=calculate). Demand history is long and no clear recent sustained regime shift since summer; use default demand estimates (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This configuration balances service level (uses observed longer lead times) while relying on full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to short-term noise or the single lost shipment.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=202. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time has been 1\u20132 periods but recent confirmed evidence (Periods 2\u21924, 7\u21928, 9\u219210, 11\u219213, 12\u219214, 15\u219217) supports using the promised lead time; earlier missing P1 shipment likely lost but no new sustained lead-time shift. Demand history is noisy with occasional spikes (e.g., Periods 33,35) but no confirmed persistent regime change. To let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics and the promised lead time while avoiding overfitting to recent zero-arrival noise, I select default lead time and default demand parameters so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples (scale by 1+L). This balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=202. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2 periods) with recent evidence skewing to 2 but some 1s; recent observed lead times (last 5) average \u22481.6, so I use a recent_N estimate for L to blend variability. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default to leverage the full historical demand sample set (stable long history) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (captures slightly elevated lead-time risk) versus holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=202. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but several confirmations of 2-period lead (P2->P4, P11->P13, P12->P14, P15->P17) and some 1-periods earlier; average observed lead time \u22481.67. Demand has occasional spikes (P42=175, P43=116) but not yet a sustained (>3 periods) regime change, so keep demand forecast conservative. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect empirical delivery behavior. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, balancing service level against holding cost given uncertain arrivals and no confirmed sustained demand shift.

Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1 and 2 periods); earlier investigation confirmed lead time=2 for some arrivals but some shipments were delayed/lost. Given mixed evidence and no new sustained shift in lead time or demand regime, use calculated average lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full sample history for mu/sigma. This balances service (uses observed lead-time history) vs holding cost conservatively given zero on-hand and a large in-transit pipeline.

Historical concluded lead-time evidence (Period 4/5) confirms actual lead time = 2 for recent arrivals; some early orders remain missing (possible lost shipment) but no new sustained lead-time change. Demand history shows higher winter demand (several large recent weekly demands) but no confirmed sustained regime shift across 3+ periods. Given confirmed LT=2 and no strong recent demand regime change, use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting it balance service vs holding costs under the promised lead time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=202. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1\u20132 periods with recent confirmation of LT=2 for one shipment and one earlier lost shipment; no sustained new lead-time regime. Demand history (weeks listed) shows weekly variability but no confirmed persistent shift requiring a different demand estimator. To be robust and let the OR engine use its promised-lead-time model and full-sample statistics, I select default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility calculations. This leverages all historical samples for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 while the OR engine's capped policy controls order size; keeping defaults avoids overreacting to isolated missing shipments while the carry-over insight records the prior confirmed LT=2 and the likely lost P1 shipment already in history.
