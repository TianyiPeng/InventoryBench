Demand analysis: recent concluded demands (P6\u2013P14) = [28,13,25,12,3,5,10,10,1]; recent mean \u2248 11.7 units/week, with clear downward trend to single digits in latest periods. Lead-time / pipeline: Concluded history shows P5 order (300) never arrived and has been flagged as lost in carry-over; current In-transit=320 therefore contains ~300 unavailable units and only 20 valid in-transit (P14 order). Inventory/pipeline assessment: On-hand = 43, usable in-transit expected = 0 visible arrivals until at least P16 (P14 order with promised 2-period lead would arrive in Period 16 if not lost, but historically some orders have had 1-period actual lead; however only concluded arrivals are reliable). Risk: Holding cost = $1/unit/period is high relative to profit; avoid unnecessary stock. Ordering logic: With promised lead time 2, plan should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Forecasting 10\u201312 units/week \u2192 target position \u2248 30\u201336 units. Current on-hand (43) already exceeds target; therefore place no order this period to reduce holding cost and risk of excess inventory.",

{
  "rationale": "World/cal: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (New Year week) \u2014 elevated seasonal demand likely but recent weeks show high but variable sales. Demand analysis: recent demands P42\u2013P46 = [661,118,101,124,135]; excluding the 661 outlier (promo spike), a realistic recent weekly demand \u2248 (118+101+124+135)/4 \u2248 119\u2013125 units. Lead time & pipeline: historical concluded arrivals support confirmed LT=2 periods; current on-hand=121 and in-transit=533 (total visible supply=654) which comfortably covers (L+1)=3 periods of expected demand (3\xd7125\u2248375). Inventory cost tradeoff: profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 excess inventory is costly. No strong evidence of a new sustained demand regime beyond already recorded spikes. Decision: place no order this period to avoid excess holding while pipeline meets short-term demand and to observe actual arrivals for LT confirmation.",
