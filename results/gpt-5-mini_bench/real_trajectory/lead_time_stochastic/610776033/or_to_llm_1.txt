On-hand=0 and in-transit=165 (P1=100, P2=65) are visible but arrivals from those orders will only be confirmed in later conclude messages per the lead-time rules. Demand assessment: Historical pre-shift mean was low, but a demand regime shift was previously flagged (carry-over insight). Recent realized demands in the game history are much higher (Period1 demand=129, Period2 demand=268), but this is only two high periods\u2014insufficient (requires 3+ periods) to mark a sustained new regime per carry-over rules. OR recommended 77 using promised L and long-run history; given recent high realized demand there is risk OR underestimates short-term need. Strategy & quantity reasoning: Because profit = holding cost (q=0.5), we avoid aggressive overstocking but still provide a buffer against recent elevated demand and possible pipeline delays/loss. We therefore increase the OR recommendation moderately to provide cover for one additional expected high-demand period while not overcommitting. Action: order 150 units (raise OR's 77 to 150).
