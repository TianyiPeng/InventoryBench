Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean=185.4 units/week (N=5). No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. Promised lead time=2. Given high profit vs holding (q\u22480.95) and no sign of lost/delayed shipments or demand regime change, use defaults so backend computes base-stock from historical mean/variance and promised L. This balances high service level with holding cost while we gather arrival/lead-time evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=292 (order placed Period 1 has not concluded yet). Historical weekly demand samples (5): [289,161,122,154,201], mean=185.4. One period without arrival is insufficient to conclude a lead-time change or lost shipment. Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and variance. Methods chosen: L=default to keep promised lead time; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples; sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service (covers L+1 periods) against holding cost given limited evidence of delay.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent historical weekly demand samples: [289,161,122,154,201] (mean=185.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=570 (orders from P1/P2 not yet concluded). Promised lead time = 2 and we have no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot reliably infer a lead-time change. I therefore use default lead time (promised). For demand I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect full review+lead period demand and avoid overreacting to two zero-arrival concludes. Volatility uses default to let the OR engine compute safety stock from historical variance. This balances service (using all available history) versus holding cost while awaiting confirmed evidence of lead-time or demand regime shifts.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=0, in-transit=680 (orders placed P1-P3: 292+278+110). Recent realized demands: P1=136, P2=143, P3=93; historical weekly samples available (Jan\u2013Feb). Orders placed so far have not concluded for 3 consecutive periods, so possible delays/losses but not yet confirmed as permanent. I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) to let OR backend assume promised lead time while we gather definitive conclude evidence. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent demand regime (balance between the Jan\u2013Feb historical samples and the last observed weeks) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 samples. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the last 5 samples. This keeps targets responsive to recent demand while the outstanding 680 units are monitored; if shipments remain missing we will switch to an explicit longer L in a future period.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (total 680 units) have not arrived by Period 4 conclude (3 consecutive periods without arrival) \u2014 possible sustained shipment delay or losses; monitor for confirmation.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): recent concluded history shows one confirmed lead time: Period2 order arrived in Period4 \u2192 observed lead_time = 2. On-hand=120, in-transit=402. Use observed lead time (calculate) to align with arrivals. Demand history (5 samples mean=185.4) suggests no proven recent demand regime shift; use default demand/volatility scaling for (1+L) review+lead period. These settings give the OR backend a 3-period demand forecast (1+L=3) and default volatility to balance service level vs holding cost while we monitor for further missed arrivals.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=526 (orders from Periods 1,3,5 remain in-transit). We observed one concluded arrival showing lead_time=2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4), so no strong evidence to override promised lead time. Given noisy/limited recent demand and some delayed shipments, use default (promised) lead time and default demand estimates (use all historical samples) to avoid overreacting to transient volatility while the pipeline clears. These defaults let the OR backend compute base-stock that balances profit ($19) vs holding ($1) across the (1+L) review+lead horizon.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=524; recent concludes show mixed lead times: order on P2 arrived in P4 (LT=2) and order on P5 arrived in P6 (LT=1) \u2192 recent average LT \u22481.5. Several earlier orders (Periods 1\u20133) experienced long/no arrivals (carry-over). To be responsive to recent realized variability but still reflect short delays, set L using recent_N of the last 2 observed lead times. Demand has varied recently (period demands: 136,143,93,158,191,152); to focus the forecast on recent behavior I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures most recent regime while smoothing one outlier). These choices raise the target base stock enough to protect service level given in-transit uncertainty while limiting extra holding cost by using a recent-sample volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=544. Recent concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 use recent average to reflect variability. Recent demand shows elevated/variable sales last 3 periods (P5-P7: 191,152,211) so base stock should be driven by recent mean and recent volatility to balance service vs holding cost. Therefore set L via recent_N (last 2 observed lead times), mu_hat recent_N using last 3 demand samples, and sigma_hat recent_N using last 3 samples to capture current regime and higher recent variance.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent demand has risen: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 4-8) = [158,191,152,211,219], mean=186.2, showing a sustained higher-demand regime vs earlier periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=498 \u2014 pipeline is sizeable but includes orders with variable observed lead times (observed W = 2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures variability seen in conclude messages). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to base mu_hat on the last 5 periods (captures the recent elevated regime). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the higher recent demand while letting the OR engine incorporate observed lead-time average and recent variability, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. Recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 6 demands: 158,191,152,211,219,159) vs earlier lower periods. Pipeline shows 645 in-transit, on-hand 0; several earlier orders were delayed but some later orders arrived with mixed lead times (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1]). To balance service and holding cost I use a short recent lead-time estimate (average of last 4 observed lead times) and base-stock inputs driven by recent demand (recent 6 samples) to capture the higher current demand regime while keeping variance from the recent window for safety stock. This approach is conservative on lead time (captures recent variability) and responsive on demand (raises target inventory to avoid stockouts given current demand spike).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2257.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=118, in-transit=402. History of concluded arrivals shows observed lead times of [2,1,2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5), and demand has shifted up since Period 5. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use average observed lead time (captures mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 5\u201310) because demand since Period 5 is a sustained higher regime (mean \u2248176 units/week) and (1+L) scaling will be applied by backend. I use sigma recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward current higher demand while letting the OR engine account for the inferred shorter effective lead-time vs. promised lead time and limit excess holding costs.

To balance service level (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) and uncertain lead time, set L to be computed from observed lead times (avg) so backend accounts for shorter recent arrivals; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the OR engine uses full-sample demand statistics scaled by (1+L). This keeps orders responsive to observed lead-time mix while avoiding overfitting to short-term demand noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=632 units (large outstanding pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (observed arrivals: 1,2,2,1,2,1), so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand has settled in the 115\u2013219 range over the last several weeks (recent volatility lower than the early 289 spike), so base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 demand observations to capture the current regime. These settings let the OR backend size a base-stock for the observed lead-time mix while using recent demand mean/variance to balance service level (profit high relative to holding cost) against inventory holding risk given the already-large pipeline.

Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=32, in-transit=518. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 1 or 2 periods (no sustained >2 or confirmed lost shipments beyond the earlier note). To let the backend learn the best effective lead time from observed data I choose L='calculate' (average of observed lead times). Demand shows no sustained regime shift vs. available samples, so use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine can compute base stock and caps with the inferred L. This balances service (using observed lead-time evidence) against holding cost without overfitting short recent fluctuations.

Several earlier orders (Periods 1-3) were delayed, so I use a recent average to capture current lead-time regime while keeping responsiveness. Set L to recent_N (N=5) to average the most recent lead-time evidence (avg ~1.6) so the OR engine scales the review+lead demand appropriately. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand is based on full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) letting the backend compute base stock while incorporating the chosen L. This balances service (captures higher effective lead time) against holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=601. Historical concluded lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2 periods); some early orders showed prolonged non-arrival (possible losses) but recent concludes show mostly 1\u20132. Demand has trended down recently (last 5 demands: 115,82,81,79,73; recent mean ~86). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history average (captures 1\u20132 variability). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to emphasize the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk given holding cost; this helps the OR backend lower the base stock while accounting for recent volatility. This approach is conservative about inventory given outstanding in-transit units and prior delayed shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=81, in-transit=468. Historical concluded lead times alternate between 1 and 2 periods (recent sequence includes multiple 2s and some 1s). Demand has softened recently (last 5 concluded period demands: 82,81,79,73,52; recent mean ~73.4). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture the mixed 1\u20132 period reality. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility; this focuses the base-stock on near-term demand and limits excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been moderate (many weeks with demand ~50\u2013220, most recent: 52,51). On-hand=30, in-transit=468 \u2014 pipeline large relative to current demand. Concluded history shows typical actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods with no sustained new lead-time evidence (the prior multi-period missing arrival was already noted). I therefore keep L at default (promised 2), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to short-term volatility while letting the OR engine cap orders based on its cap rule, preserving profit vs. holding-cost balance given high pipeline inventory.

Several earlier orders were delayed/missing per carry-over; pipeline is large but uncertain. Use calculate for L to reflect observed average lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given lead-time uncertainty.

Demand history available is limited but no clear recent sustained shift in demand mean/variance. To balance service level vs holding cost, use the observed average lead time (calculate) so the OR backend scales the review+lead demand appropriately; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses all historical samples for demand and volatility.

On-hand=0, in-transit=574 (large pipeline but previous carry-over noted missing arrivals earlier). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2); using "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times. To react to the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the latest demand level and volatility, reducing overstock risk given holding cost is low but pipeline is large.

To capture the recent regime and avoid overstocking given low recent demand, set lead time and demand estimates using recent_N (last 5 observations) so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most relevant recent regime. This balances service (protect against remaining in-transit uncertainty) versus holding cost in a falling-demand environment.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent weekly demand has trended low (most recent concluded demands: 9,2, etc.) but historical sample mean ~185/wk (Jan samples). On-hand=12, in-transit=551 \u2014 large pipeline but several past orders experienced delayed arrivals (carry-over notes). Observed concluded lead times are 1\u20132 periods; no sustained confirmation of a longer lead time. I therefore use the default promised lead time (L=2) and default demand/statistics so backend uses (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std, which balances service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) and the large existing pipeline. This avoids overreacting to recent low draws or transient shipment delays.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-07-29. On-hand=10, in-transit=551. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (11 observed: mean \u22481.64). No new sustained demand regime change. Use calculated average lead time to reflect measured variability; use default demand and volatility (all-sample) so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, preserving service level under the inferred longer-than-promised lead time and avoiding aggressive overordering given high in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05): on-hand=6, in-transit=551. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods with some 1-periods; no new sustained pattern (no 3+ period confirmed change) beyond previously noted possible delays. I choose to let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from observed concludes (calculate) to capture the observed mix of 1s and 2s. For demand mean and volatility I use default (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) or sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine can combine the inferred L with full historical demand samples to set base stock and caps.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent realized demand has collapsed vs earlier periods (summer lull). On-hand=6, in-transit=551 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods). I choose L by averaging observed lead times to let backend infer typical delivery delay. For demand I use a recent_N (N=5) forecast to capture the new low-demand regime (last 5 demands: 9,2,2,4,0) and avoid inflating orders from earlier high-season weeks. Sigma is recent_N (N=5) to reflect current low-volatility environment. These choices reduce excess ordering given large in-transit stock and low current demand while keeping safety for short lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg demand since P21 (Periods 21\u201326) = 5.3 units vs prior long-run period average \u2248 120 units; sustained low-demand regime (6 consecutive periods).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has shifted to a sustained low regime since Period 21 (six periods, avg ~5.3/week). Observed concluded lead times historically are mixed but largely 2 periods; use aggregated observed lead-time inference rather than trusting a single promised value. On-hand=1 + in-transit=551 gives pipeline=552 but prior multi-period missing arrivals warn of possible lost/delayed shipments; selecting demand estimates that reflect the low-demand regime reduces over-order risk. Choices: L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concludes; mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 6 demand samples (captures the low-demand regime); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent low-demand volatility. These parameters prioritize avoiding excess holding cost while keeping adequate service for the low-demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (avg \u22485.3 over P21\u2013P26). On-hand is 0 and in-transit is large (551) but we have had no concluded arrivals in Periods 23\u201328 (7 consecutive concludes with arrived=0), indicating actual shipments are delayed or lost and effective lead time is longer than the promised 2. To be conservative I explicitly lengthen L to account for delayed arrivals, and I set demand estimates using the recent low-demand regime (N=6) so orders match current low demand and avoid excess holding costs. Sigma is estimated from the same recent window to reflect current low variability.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained shipment delays/lost arrivals: no concluded arrivals in Periods 23\u201328 despite 551 units in-transit (evidence of effective lead time > promised 2).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (recent avg \u22485.3 units/week). There are 551 units in-transit with no concluded arrivals for many periods, indicating effective lead time > promised 2. To be conservative I set L explicitly longer to cover observed delays (explicit L=4). For demand I use recent_N on the confirmed low-demand regime (N=6 covering Periods 21\u201326) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to capture recent low-volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering given probable lost/delayed shipments while matching the new low demand pattern to balance service and holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09): demand has remained in the low regime since P21 (recent mean \u22485 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=551 (multiple periods of non-arrival \u2192 suspect prolonged/delayed shipments). To avoid over-ordering while accounting for sustained low demand, set lead time explicitly longer to reflect observed delays and reduce ordering rate. Chosen L explicit=5 to lengthen the coverage window; mu_hat explicit = (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u2248 6\xd75.3 = 31.8 to target service for the low-demand regime across review+lead; sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to capture recent low-demand volatility (use last 10 demand samples for std). This lowers order quantities given large stuck pipeline and low demand, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (avg \u22485.3/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=551 units with no concluded arrivals in Periods 23\u201331 (9 consecutive periods). This strongly suggests effective lead time exceeds the promised 2 or shipments are lost; to be conservative I set L explicitly longer. I use a recent_N demand estimate based on the low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201331, N=11) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stocking appropriate for the new low-demand level while L=3 increases pipeline coverage to mitigate stockouts if some in-transit arrives late. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >2 periods: no concluded arrivals in Periods 23\u201331 despite 551 units in-transit (sustained delay/lost shipments over 9 periods).

Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (recent weeks avg \u22485.3). To avoid over-ordering into the stuck pipeline, set lead time explicit to 3 to reflect longer effective LT; forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (last 12 periods since P21\u2013P32) so mu_hat uses recent_N N=12 and sigma_hat uses recent_N N=12.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 34 (2019-09-30). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (avg \u22485.3/week); recent 13 periods (P21\u2013P33) show persistent low demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=551 units but no concluded arrivals since P22\u2014evidence of sustained delays/lost shipments and confirmed effective lead time >2. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed longer effective lead time (conservative one-period extension beyond promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (the post-changepoint regime length) so mu_hat reflects the low-demand regime over P21\u2013P33. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=13 to capture recent lower volatility. These choices reduce ordering given low demand while accounting for delayed arrivals to avoid overstocks once the in-transit batch (if it arrives) is realized.

Multiple concluded messages (Periods 23\u201331) show no arrivals despite 551 units in-transit \u2192 confirmed effective lead time > promised 2. To protect service with low demand and prolonged upstream delay, set lead time explicitly longer and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Chosen: L explicit=3 to reflect observed >2 lead time; mu_hat recent_N using last N=6 samples to capture the new low-demand mean across the review+lead horizon; sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to capture recent low-demand volatility.

There is strong evidence of prolonged shipment delays/lost arrivals: 551 units remain in-transit with no concluded arrivals across Periods 23\u201335 (\u22659 periods beyond promised L=2). To protect against underestimated lead time I set L explicit=9. To reflect the confirmed low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent 15-point regime (Periods 21\u201335) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture current mean/volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (avg \u22485.3 over P21\u2013P26 and low thereafter). On-hand=0, in-transit=551 but many past shipments never concluded (sustained delays/losses observed), so actual effective lead time is much higher than promised. Set L explicitly longer to protect against buried pipeline and delayed confirmations. For demand forecast use recent_N over the low-demand regime (N=16, Periods 21\u201336) to capture the new low mean/variance. This produces low mu_hat and low sigma_hat, letting OR backend avoid overstock while L accounts for delayed arrivals.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (Periods 21\u201337 average \u22485.3 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=551 units have shown no concluded arrivals for many periods (evidence of sustained shipment delays or losses). To avoid over-ordering into a possibly stuck pipeline while matching low current demand, set lead time explicitly longer to reflect effective delay, and forecast demand using recent low-demand regime. Chosen methods: L explicit to capture sustained delay risk; mu_hat recent_N using the recent low-demand regime (N=17 covers Periods 21\u201337) so (1+L)*mean reflects current weak demand; sigma_hat recent_N N=17 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These parameters reduce orders compared to long-run averages and limit holding cost exposure given likely stuck in-transit stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (avg \u22485.3/week) and recent periods (P21\u2013P38) show consistently low demand. There is a large in-transit volume (551) with confirmed prolonged shipment delays/lost arrivals (lead time observed > promised 2). To avoid over-ordering into high pipeline while matching current low demand, I set L explicitly to reflect the confirmed extended effective lead time (use explicit longer LT). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the low-demand regime to capture the new mean/variance (use N covering the regime). This reduces mu_hat and sigma_hat relative to long-run history and prevents the OR engine from replenishing aggressively; the explicit L prevents the backend from assuming promised (shorter) lead time and thus over-ordering. Parameters chosen: L explicit to 9 (captures sustained multi-period delays), mu_hat recent_N N=18 (covers P21\u2013P38 low-demand regime), sigma_hat recent_N N=18 (volatility estimated from same recent regime).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (avg \u22485.3 units/week over P21\u2013P26 and every week since remains low). On-hand=0, in-transit=551 but no concluded arrivals since P22\u2013P39 indicating probable lost/delayed shipments and effective lead time > promised 2. To protect against stockouts if some in-transit eventually arrive but also to avoid excessive holding if demand stays low, I set L explicitly to 3 (conservative longer lead time). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast from the confirmed low-demand regime (use the most recent 6 demand observations) so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand under the current low regime and reduces safety stock/ordering given the persistent low demand signal.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=551 but multiple concluded periods (P23\u2013P40) show no arrivals \u2192 confirmed sustained delays/lost shipments and effective lead time > promised 2. Demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 (recent weekly demands \u2248 0\u20137, recent average ~5.3). Therefore set L explicitly to 3 to reflect longer effective lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201340) so the OR backend targets much lower base stock and avoids heavy holding costs while preserving service for the low demand.

Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (avg\u22485.3/week). To reflect the observed prolonged delays, I set L explicitly above promised lead time so the OR backend plans for a longer pipeline. For demand I use recent samples to capture the low-demand regime. Sigma uses recent samples to capture current low-volatility demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 21 (recent weekly demand mostly 0\u20137, recent mean ~5). On-hand=0, in-transit=551 units outstanding for many periods (evidence of sustained delays/losses; arrivals have not concluded for 9+ periods). To avoid over-relying on the promised L=2 (which underestimates effective delay), set L explicitly longer to capture delayed arrivals. Forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (use recent_N over the most recent stable regime) and estimate volatility from the same window. These parameters bias ordering toward the low current demand while accounting for the long effective lead time and outstanding pipeline to reduce excess holding cost given the high holding horizon risk.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (avg \u22485.3/week); recent pipeline shows 551 units in-transit but multiple concluded periods (P23\u2013P32) confirm effective lead time > promised 2 (sustained delayed/lost arrivals). To be conservative vs lost shipments, set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast use the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=20 (covers the most recent 20 samples since the changepoint) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most-relevant low-demand data. These choices bias orders toward matching the much lower observed demand while acknowledging longer effective lead time, reducing risk of excess holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (recent weekly demands mostly 0\u20137, far below historical ~120). There is a large in-transit volume (551) with many periods of no concluded arrivals; prior evidence confirmed effective lead time > promised 2 (sustained no-arrival window P23\u2013P31 = 9 periods). To avoid understocking given possible extended/unstable lead times but also reflect the new low-demand regime, set lead time explicitly to observed extended delay and base demand/volatility using recent samples since the regime shift. Choices: L explicit=9 to reflect confirmed prolonged delays; mu_hat recent_N N=20 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean using the most recent 20 samples (captures the low-demand regime since P21); sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This balances high service-level incentive (profit/holding => high q) with the reality of low current demand and long/uncertain arrivals, and avoids relying on stale high-demand history.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (recent avg \u22485.3) and very low in the most recent weeks (Periods 40\u201345 avg \u22482.8). There are 551 units in-transit with a long history of non-arrivals (confirmed lead time >2 and many overdue/lost shipments). To avoid over-ordering against a likely lost pipeline, I set lead time explicitly higher than promised to be conservative (L=3). For demand I use a recent-N estimate to capture the sustained low-demand regime and recent weekly pattern (N=6 chosen to cover the last 6 concluded periods). Sigma is also estimated from the same recent window to reflect current low volatility. These choices reduce order sizes versus long-run historical averages and mitigate holding cost risk given the large suspicious in-transit quantity.

To be conservative vs. lost shipments, set lead time explicitly to 3 (longer than promised 2) so backend orders account for slower effective flow. Forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent 20 weeks since the regime change) so base-stock reflects current low mean and volatility and avoids overstock/holding cost given high holding penalty relative to demand.
