  "rationale": "Date is 2019-12-23 (week before Christmas). Product is womens denim\u2014possible modest pre-Christmas uplift, but recent realized demand after last arrival has been low (P43\u2013P45: 24,15,21). On-hand = 179 units; in-transit = 1078 units (multiple prior shipments outstanding, including a P42\u2192P45 arrival with lead_time=3, so supplier lead time is variable and some pipeline is unreliable). Holding cost = $1/period vs profit $19/unit \u2014 stocking is profitable only if units sell, but we already have substantial pipeline that could produce heavy holding costs if more ordered. Given ample on-hand plus large in-transit, and uncertain lead-time/arrival timing, do not place additional risk orders this period. Order = 0 to avoid increasing ending inventory and holding cost while awaiting confirmation of in-transit arrivals.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-30 (week between Christmas and New Year) \u2014 historically low demand weeks for this apparel SKU. Demand history: recent observed demands are low (P45=21, P46=11) versus earlier summer peaks. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=168, in-transit=1078 (large). Lead-time behavior: supplier lead time has been variable (observed 1\u20133) and some long/delayed shipments occurred historically, so in-transit cannot be fully relied on but currently represents substantial future supply. Objective trade-off: each unit sold yields $19 profit but each unit held costs $1 this period; with current on-hand already well above recent short-term demand and heavy in-transit, additional ordering risks excessive holding cost and potential obsolescence during low seasonal demand. Decision: no new order to avoid increasing ending inventory and holding cost while current supply likely covers near-term demand.",
