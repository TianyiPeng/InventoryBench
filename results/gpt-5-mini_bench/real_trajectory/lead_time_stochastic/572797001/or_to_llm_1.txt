We have no concluded arrivals for recent in-transit units (periods up through P37 conclude show arrived=0 for recent orders), so some uncertainty exists; however the pipeline volume (1740) is far above the expected (L+1)-period demand (~319). Decision logic: holding cost equals profit ($1), so excess inventory is costly; given very large pipeline exposure and OR's mathematically justified recommendation of 0, the prudent action is to order 0 this period to avoid overstock if the in-transit arrives. If a pattern of persistent non-arrival (lost shipments) emerges in future concludes (3+ periods of missing arrivals for these specific orders), I will revise and place positive orders to protect sales.
