Inventory assessment: on-hand=0, promised lead_time=2 but actual arrivals have often been 1 when they occur; however multiple older shipments appear lost.

Product: women's belt (non-perishable, giftable) \u2014 some seasonal uplift possible but not strongly evidenced in recent data. Demand analysis: recent 9-week demand (Periods 35\u201343) = [162,154,157,98,96,71,72,122,93], mean \u2248116 units/week; use ~120/week as a cautious short-term forecast. Lead time & reliability: historical concluded arrivals show mostly 1-period actual lead time recently (multiple P\u2192P+1 observations) with occasional longer/irregular arrivals earlier; current pipeline is large and arrival timing uncertain but recent pattern supports using L=1 for planning while treating older lost shipments as resolved. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=575, in-transit=2252 \u2192 total supply=2827 units, which covers ~23\u201324 weeks at forecasted 120/wk. Holding cost high relative to profit? Holding=$1/unit/period vs profit=$19/unit \u2014 holding is modest but overstock ties capital and increases holding costs over many periods. Order logic: given large existing pipeline and sufficient on-hand to cover (L+1)=2 periods of demand (\u2248240), plus substantial in-transit, do NOT place new order to avoid excessive holding costs and potential further pipeline uncertainty. Monitor arrivals in next conclude to confirm lead time and adjust if pipeline depletes faster than expected.",

Lead time & pipeline: historical lead-time has been unreliable earlier but recent confirmed arrivals show mostly 1-period lead time for recent orders; however multiple past lost shipments mean treat outstanding in-transit cautiously. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=446, in-transit=2252 => total available\u22482698 units, which covers ~22 weeks at 120/wk even if some in-transit delayed. Cost tradeoff: Profit $19/unit >> holding $1/unit/period, but ordering more increases holding cost and risk if shipments are lost. Final order logic: no new order this period to avoid adding holding cost and potential lost shipments because current on-hand + in-transit comfortably covers expected near-term holiday demand and provides buffer against short lead-time variance.",
