P12\u2192arrival in P14 confirms lead_time can be 2, but P1 (ordered P1) and P14 (ordered P14) remain undelivered many periods later -> supplier reliability is mixed and some shipments appear lost or very delayed.

Profit and holding cost are both $1/unit, so holding inventory yields no net benefit and excess inventory that arrives before demand will incur holding cost equal to profit. Decision logic: given a moderate short-term demand (~55/week), a large uncertain pipeline (411 units) already exists, and holding cost equals profit (strong penalty for overstock), place no new order now and wait for confirmed arrivals or clearer lead-time behavior before adding to pipeline.",
