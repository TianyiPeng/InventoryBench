Supplier promised lead time = 2 periods; no concluded arrivals or prior periods to contradict this, and in-transit=0 so no evidence of delays or lost orders. With lead time 2, an order placed now will arrive during Period 3 (too late to satisfy Periods 1\u20132 demand). Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so carrying excess inventory is costly; therefore place a conservative order sized to roughly one expected arrival-period demand rather than ordering to cover multiple periods.
