Lead time: supplier promised 2 periods; arrival from the Period 1 order (420) is still in-transit and not yet concluded, so actual lead time not confirmed. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 0, in-transit 420. Decision timing: when ordering in Period 2 we must cover current period demand plus the next L=2 periods (i.e., L+1 = 3 periods) because arrivals occur after decision. Forecast: use recent realized demand (195) as a conservative short-term forecast given the upward signal. Required coverage = 195 * 3 = 585 units. Current coverage = on-hand (0) + in-transit (420) = 420. Order required = 585 - 420 = 165 units.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, pre-New Year) \u2014 demand often suppressed vs regular weeks. Product: women's ankle jeans \u2014 stable, non-seasonal basic with moderate weekly demand. Demand analysis: recent concluded demands (P41-46) = [61,114,48,47,49,41]; recent running average \u224860 but excluding the one spike (114) the median/typical week \u224848\u201350. Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised 2 periods but observed variable (1\u20133) and multiple overdue shipments historically; several old orders (notably P1 and P13) are long overdue and should be treated as likely lost until a conclude appears. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=838 (system-provided). At typical demand ~50/wk, in-transit covers ~16+ weeks of demand \u2014 far more than needed. Cost tradeoff: Profit = $4/unit; Holding = $1/unit/period. Carrying large pipeline will incur substantial holding cost each period with little service benefit given ample coverage. Action logic: do not place additional orders this period to avoid excess holding cost and because existing in-transit stock is sufficient to cover expected demand for many weeks even under moderate upticks.",
