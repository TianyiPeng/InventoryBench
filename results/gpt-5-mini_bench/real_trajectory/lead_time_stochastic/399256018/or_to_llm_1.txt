Do NOT treat this as a lost shipment yet. Inventory posture: On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (arriving later). Current visible demand: Period 1 demand=195, which is much higher than the 5-sample historical mean (~98.6). OR recommended 194 (base-stock capped using promised L and historical samples). Assessment: One very high recent demand observation suggests a potential upward shift but is not yet a sustained regime change (only one period). Given profit $4 and holding $1 (critical fractile q=0.8 \u2192 moderate safety stock), we should modestly increase OR's recommendation to protect against short-term elevated demand while avoiding excessive holding cost if the spike proves transient. Action choice: order 220 units now.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows supplier lead time varying 1\u20132 periods recently (arrivals from orders placed P2\u2192P4, P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14, P18\u2192P19, P20\u2192P22, P43\u2192P45). No new sustained lead-time change or new lost-shipment signal since carry-over insights. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=0, in-transit=453. Recent weekly demand (Dec) ~41\u201349 units; 3-period demand (1+promised L=3) \u2248 120\u2013150 units. Pipeline (453) >> expected 3-period demand, so pipeline alone covers multiple weeks of demand even if some variability or a few lost units occur. Cost tradeoff: profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 prefer avoiding excess ordering because holding cost is material. OR recommended 0; given large confirmed pipeline and no new sustained regime shift, ordering more would only increase holding cost without improving service. Final strategy: follow OR and place 0 units this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs while allowing in-transit inventory to arrive and be observed in subsequent conclude messages. Monitor arrivals next periods for any lost shipments or regime shifts before ordering.",
