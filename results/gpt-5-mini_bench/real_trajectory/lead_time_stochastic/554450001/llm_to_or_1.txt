Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean\u2248218.6, no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time unknown. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so need to replenish for review+lead periods. Promised lead time=2 and no evidence to override it. Profit and holding cost are equal (profit=$1, holding=$1) implying a critical ratio of 0.5; default base-stock policy is appropriate. Set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, which balances service vs. holding given limited data and no lead-time surprises.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent historical weekly demand mean ~218.6 (samples 2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=248 (order placed Period 1) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unobserved. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. This keeps policy aligned with historical baseline while awaiting concluded arrival evidence before altering lead-time or demand regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) have mean \u2248218.6 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=501 (sum of P1/P2 orders = 248+253). Orders placed in P1 and P2 have not concluded yet (arrived=0 in conclude messages) \u2014 this indicates delays but is only 2 periods of missing arrivals, insufficient to confirm a persistent lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std scaling while the large in-transit volume provides coverage against the 3-period (1+L) review+lead window. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given in-transit) versus holding cost while we await confirmed arrival evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand samples (weekly) avg ~218.6; on-hand=0, in-transit=683. Three consecutive conclude messages (Periods 1-3) show arrived=0 for orders placed, indicating missing/delayed shipments but no concluded arrivals to compute actual lead time. I keep L as default (promised=2) because there's insufficient confirmed lead-time evidence; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service level\u2014using full historical demand\u2014against holding cost while we gather definitive arrival data.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (ordered=248,253,182) all show arrived=0 in their conclude messages (3 consecutive periods), suggesting lost or delayed shipments / actual lead time >2.

Daily Profit: $179.00, Daily Holding Cost: $74.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concludes show Period2 order (253) arrived in Period4 => observed lead time = 2. On-hand=74, in-transit=430 (pipeline healthy despite earlier missing-arrive flags). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirms promised 2). Demand history (mean ~218.6) implies (1+L)*mean \u2248 656; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute base_stock and cap from full-sample stats, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period2 order 253 arrived in Period4 -> lead_time=2)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=572. Historical recent demand (Periods1-5): 241,258,167,179,165 \u2192 recent mean=202. Evidence: Period4 conclude shows Period2 order arrived with lead_time=2; earlier Periods1-3 had missing arrivals but one confirmed lead_time=2. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead_time=2. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the clear downward shift from late-Jan highs to ~170s in the last three periods while still including two higher earlier weeks; (1+L) scaling will be applied by backend. This balances service level (cover ~L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and substantial in-transit stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history shows variable lead times (observed 2 and 1) and three most recent demand periods (P4-6: 179,165,177) form a lower, stable regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=464 (covers some upcoming demand but past missing arrivals signal caution). I set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate) so the backend averages recent observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (uses P4-6) because a clear downward shift persisted for 3 periods; this yields (1+L)-scaled mean focused on the new regime to avoid overstock. Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect reduced volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize matching orders to the new lower-demand regime while letting the backend compute safety stock using the inferred lead time, mitigating risk from prior lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has stepped down from ~220s (Jan) to ~160-180 in the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 3-7). Concluded lead-time observations are mixed (one observed L=2 for a Period2 order, one observed L=1 for a Period5 order), so I use the backend's calculate option to let it average observed lead times. On-hand=0, in-transit=521 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrival timing uncertain, so I tighten demand forecast to the most recent regime (last 5 periods) to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service. Choices: L="calculate" to capture observed variability; mu_hat="recent_N" with N=5 to base forecast on the recent lower-demand regime; sigma_hat="recent_N" with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These settings reduce target base-stock relative to long-run averages and mitigate holding cost given uncertain arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=430. Recent concluded lead times show variability (observed 2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5) so use calculated average lead time to reflect this. Demand recent 5-period mean (Periods 4-8 = 179,165,177,160,205 \u2192 mean\u2248177) used for mu_hat to capture current lower-than-January regime. Use recent 5-period std for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the recent demand regime while the calculated L accounts for mixed observed lead times; having large in-transit stock reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demands show moderate, variable weekly sales (most recent 5 demands: 165,177,160,205,111 \u2192 mean ~164). On-hand=0, in-transit=532 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead-times are mixed (1 and 2); use backend 'calculate' to let observed average drive L. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the latest demand regime and avoid older Jan samples. This balances service (cover near-term demand) while the large in-transit reduces urgent ordering, lowering holding risk.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): recent demand has softened vs. earlier peaks (last 5 demands: Period6-10 = 177,160,205,111,84). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); average of observed lead times is best single estimate. To capture recent downward demand shift I use a recent_N forecast over the last 5 demand observations for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects current lower demand and reduces holding costs.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=430. Concluded lead-time observations: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8), 1 (P9->P10) \u2192 average ~1.4. Some earlier orders (P1-3) showed arrived=0 for 3 consecutive periods (possible lost/delayed), but more recent concludes show mixed 1\u20132 period lead times. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time. Demand history provided (Jan\u2013Feb samples) is limited and stable; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding. This approach updates lead-time estimate while keeping demand forecast conservative given limited/seasonal data and earlier shipment irregularities.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=550. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,1 \u2192 avg ~1.4) and some earlier missing shipments. To let the backend infer a stabilized lead time from concluded evidence I select L='calculate' (average observed lead times). Demand history is limited but no clear recent sustained shift in mean/variance, so use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost while acknowledging past delayed/lost shipments.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=0, in-transit=550. Concluded history shows mixed lead times (observed W={2,1,2,1,1}, avg\u22481.4) and recent demand has declined from ~220s to ~100-130s. Some prior shipments were delayed/lost but only concluded arrivals are trusted. I set L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 1.4 signal). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the last 5 demand samples: 111,84,89,126,108 -> recent mean ~103.6) to reflect the lower recent demand regime and reduce overstock risk given high in-transit volume. This balances service (covering review+lead demand) versus holding cost by lowering forecasted demand and variability to recent behavior.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=430. History shows observed lead times of 1\u20132 periods (mixed, no clear longer shift) and several missing/delayed shipments earlier but recent concludes show arrivals with LT=1 or 2. To be robust to current variability, set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate). Recent demand (Periods 11\u201315 = 89,126,108,152,114) averages ~117.8; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current regime. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base stock to recent realized demand while letting its lead-time estimate reflect measured arrivals, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 9-16): [111,84,89,126,108,152,114,104], mean=111. To balance service vs. holding cost (profit=holding), I use an empirically averaged lead time and base-stock sized to the most recent demand regime (N=8) so the OR engine reacts to current ~111/week demand while accounting for multi-period pipeline uncertainty.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=430. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W sequence = 2,1,2,1,1,2 \u2192 avg 1.5) so I use calculate for L to let backend encode observed average. Recent demand has shifted down from earlier ~160s to ~110s in the last 5 concluded periods (periods 13-17 demands = 108,152,114,104,77); I therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new lower regime. This keeps ordered quantity aligned with short-term demand while the backend will balance service vs holding cost using the provided estimates. In-transit (430) currently provides a buffer; using recent demand-based forecasts will avoid excess holding given holding cost = profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=479. Recent history shows intermittent delays and a mix of observed lead times (1 and 2 periods) and several earlier missing arrivals; demand history (2019-01 through Period 19) is variable but not showing a sustained high spike. I choose L by averaging observed lead times (method=calculate) to let the backend infer the effective lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) providing a smoothed forecast; with profit=holding, this balances service level vs. holding cost by defaulting to the backend's base-stock computation while letting L capture recent lead-time behavior. This approach is robust to intermittent lost shipments and mixed lead-time evidence while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

To capture recent lower summer demand I use recent data for forecasting. L set to calculate (average of observed concluded lead times) so backend infers current typical lead time from evidence. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 (last 6 demand samples) to reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk while the pipeline is large. This balances service (using inferred L) against holding cost given Profit=Holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=479. Recent observed lead times vary (1\u20132 periods); I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted down vs. earlier samples; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 observed demands (Periods 17\u201321) to capture the new lower-demand regime. These settings reduce overstocks from stale high-demand estimates while letting the OR engine size orders for current variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: prior sample mean \u2248218.6 (early 2019 samples 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04); recent mean (Periods 17\u201321, 2019-06-03 to 2019-07-01) = 82.4 (\u221262%), sustained for 5 periods.

I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded messages (captures 1\u20132 period reality). For demand I use recent_N N=5 (Periods 17\u201321 mean=82.4) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean, reflecting the sustained ~62% drop vs. early-2019. Volatility also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent lower variance. These choices reduce inventory overshoot given large in-transit stock and lower current demand while letting the OR engine size safety stock to the observed lead-time distribution and recent demand regime.

Past concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 periods; some earlier missing arrivals occurred but lead time has been observed as 2. I select L=default to use the promised/confirmed 2-period setting. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (use last 5 demand observations) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent volatility over the same 5 periods. These choices keep orders aligned to the current lower demand while accounting for 2-period pipeline, reducing excess holding cost given holding/profit parity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=479. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201321 mean \u224882.4) and several concluded lead-time observations (1s and 2s). To reflect observed lead-time variability I let the backend calculate L from concluded lead times. To capture the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent regime (N=5). These settings steer the OR backend toward lower forecasted (1+L)-period demand and smaller safety stock, reducing holding cost while preserving service given current low demand and uncertain arrivals.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand regime is the lower level observed since Period 17 (samples P17\u2013P25: 77,57,112,61,105,105,114,82,87) \u2014 sustained lower demand vs. early-2019. On-hand=0, in-transit=479 (sizable pipeline). No new confirmed lead-time change (observed lead time = 2 previously). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 9 periods (P17\u2013P25) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand from the current low regime; keep L=default (promised lead time = 2) because concluded messages confirm lead time=2 and there is no new evidence of loss or drift. This reduces overstock risk given large in-transit inventory while maintaining service for the lower demand level.

I keep L=default (promised 2) because concluded history confirms lead time \u22482 and no new sustained shift. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the lower recent mean/volatility (uses last 5 demands: P22\u2013P26 = 105,114,82,87,107).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=479. Recent demand has been lower than early-2019 but with some volatility (last 5 demands: P23-27 = 114,82,87,107,170). Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1s and 2s; average observed lead time ~1.5. To balance service vs holding cost given low profit/holding parity (q=0.5) and recent demand regime, estimate lead time from observed history and base demand off the most recent 5 weeks to capture current regime and recent spike. sigma_hat uses recent 5 to reflect current volatility. These settings instruct the OR backend to size base-stock to recent demand while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid over/under-ordering given many units already in transit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=479. Historical demand shows a sustained downshift from early-2019 highs to lower summer demand; more recent weeks (Periods 22\u201328) include a small cluster with higher spikes (170,167) so I anchor forecasts on the most recent 7 weeks to capture current level and recent volatility. Promised lead time remains 2; prior concludes confirm lead_time=2 in earlier periods. Given profit=holding, service/stock tradeoff is balanced so fresh recent mean+volatility estimate is appropriate to avoid overstock on a lower-demand regime while covering recent spikes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Periods 17\u201321 (mean \u224882.4) and remained subdued through Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=479 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 but observed lead times vary; average of observed concluded lead times ~1.5. I set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times so the backend uses empirical average. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor mu_hat to the confirmed low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201321) and reduce overstock risk. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the lower, recent demand while letting the backend cap orders by its cap and observed lead-time estimate, limiting holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=479 (sufficient pipeline for several periods); historical confirmed lead_time=2 in prior insight but some past lost shipments occurred\u2014no new sustained evidence of further lead-time change. Recent demand shows higher variability vs the low regime previously recorded (Periods 17\u201321 mean=82.4) so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the latest pattern. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (2) because confirmed lead-time evidence is mixed and losses are historical. For demand, use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 21\u201330 mean=122) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean captures current demand level. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These settings leverage the healthy in-transit stock while letting the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances unit profit vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=479. Historical concluded lead-time evidence is mixed but includes confirmed 2-period observations; promised lead time=2. Recent demand (Periods 27\u201331 = 170,167,113,170,185) shows a higher mean (~161) versus the earlier low regime; I therefore use the promised/default lead time and set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the recent uptick. sigma is likewise estimated from the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (capture recent higher demand) against holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time \u22482 and promised lead time=2; several earlier periods showed lost/delayed shipments but recent concludes support L=2. Demand experienced a sustained downshift in Periods 17\u201321 (mean\u224882.4 over 5 weeks). I therefore set L to default (use promised lead time=2) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the lower-demand regime (use last 5 demand samples from the confirmed low regime) so the OR backend targets a lower base-stock and tighter cap, reducing excess holding on the large in-transit pipeline while preserving service for the current lower-demand regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=486. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages): {2,1,2,1,1,2} \u2192 avg=1.5, so use calculated lead time to reflect mixed 1\u20132 outcomes. Demand shows a recent sustained uptick: periods 27\u201333 demands = [170,167,113,170,185,175,337], avg\u2248188 over 7 periods (previous recent mean \u224882.4), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime (recent_N, N=7) to capture the new higher demand and higher volatility. These parameters increase target base stock to reduce stockouts under higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock for variability; using calculate for L lets backend reconcile observed lead times.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 27\u201333 (2019-08-12 to 2019-09-23): avg demand increased from ~82.4 (Periods 17\u201321) to ~188 (+128%), sustained for 7 periods.

On-hand=0, in-transit=565 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,1,2} (avg 1.5) \u2014 use recent observed lead times to capture actual variability. Set L via recent_N=6 to reflect the last 6 concluded lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand (most recent regime) to capture current higher demand: recent_N=8 (Periods 27\u201334) for both mean and volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend sizes base stock to current high-demand regime while L reflects recent actual lead-time behavior; large in-transit reduces urgent ordering but we rely on recent demand stats to avoid understock if pipeline arrives late or is partially lost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=569 \u2014 substantial pipeline but recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times and some delayed/lost shipments historically. Demand has shifted to a higher recent regime (Periods 27\u201333 avg \u2248188 sustained for 7 periods); I therefore base demand forecast on the most recent 7-period regime. I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded evidence is mixed (both 2 and occasional 3) and not yet a sustained confirmed change. Using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the backend on the current high-demand regime while the default lead time avoids over-adjusting for sporadic delays.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand shows a sustained high regime since Period 27 (avg ~188 over P27\u201333) and the last 7 periods (P30\u2013P36) average \u2248201 \u2014 I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current elevated demand. On-hand=0, in-transit=586 (ample pipeline), but lead times have varied (observed lead_times: 2,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,1; avg\u22481.67). I set L using 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat with recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current high-demand regime (captures the spike and recent weeks' variability). This balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost by relying on recent demand stats and the pipeline inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=603. Recent conclude history shows variable actual lead times (observed lead_times average \u22481.9 from concludes) with intermittent 3-period arrivals late (Periods 35\u201336) but not yet a 3+ period sustained shift. Demand regime shifted up in Periods 27\u201333 (avg \u2248188) and recent demands remain at that higher level (Period 31\u201337 demands: 185,175,337,210,203,125,165). I choose L="calculate" so the backend averages observed lead times (captures recent variability without over-committing to promised 2). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=7 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 7 demand samples (captures the recent higher-demand regime). sigma_hat="default" uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices let the OR engine raise the base stock to match the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting calculated L reflect observed variability; default sigma keeps safety consistent with historical dispersion. Given large in-transit (603), orders will be capped by pipeline, preventing over-ordering despite higher mu_hat.

======================================================================

Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=586. Historical concluded lead times are variable (1\u20133); using recent observed lead times gives an average \u22482. Demand has shifted recently to a higher regime (Periods 34\u201338 mean \u2248185.6). To match recent demand and the effective pipeline, I set L using recent lead-time evidence and set mu_hat/sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand observations (captures current high-demand regime and recent volatility). This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by using a short recent window rather than the long-run mean.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Periods 27\u201334 (avg ~188) and the last 6 demands (P34\u2013P39) average ~176, so I use a recent-window demand estimate. Multiple concluded arrivals show consistent 3-period leads (P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39), so I set lead time explicitly to 3 to protect against delayed/lost shipments. Given profit=holding, target service quantile=0.5 implies modest safety stock; using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6) focuses the forecast on the current high-demand regime and recent volatility while the OR backend computes base_stock and caps. Current pipeline (in-transit 558) will be reconciled by the OR engine using L=3.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P32 order arrived P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, In-transit=704. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 3 periods (confirmed P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). Recent demand regime is the elevated regime (Periods 34\u201340 mean \u2248173 over 7 weeks). To cover review+lead demand and reflect the confirmed longer lead time, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current high-demand regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand data; this raises the base-stock to protect service given long lead time but keeps variability estimated from the same recent window to avoid overstock from older samples.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 27 (sustained elevated weekly demand ~170-225). On-hand=0, in-transit=704 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133) with recent confirmations of 3; average of concluded lead times used to reflect this. I set L to calculate (average of observed lead times) so the OR backend accounts for the empirically longer lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime (most recent 15 samples) so base stock and caps reflect current demand while the large in-transit reduces new ordering pressure.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=704. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 34 (~avg ~188) and lead time repeatedly observed =3 periods (confirmed P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). Given confirmed LT=3, set L explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead demand forecast and volatility on the latest high-demand regime (captures Periods 36\u201342 demand pattern while limiting older low-demand data). This choice aligns pipeline targets ((1+L) periods) with observed elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability (including the large spike) so the backend will raise base stock appropriately without overreacting to very old low-demand samples. In-transit 704 roughly matches a 4-period demand forecast at ~188/unit, so no immediate corrective explicit mu value is needed.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 3 (multiple orders: P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39, P40\u2192P43). On-hand=52, in-transit=669. To cover demand over the review+lead period and match observed lead-time, set L explicitly to 3. Demand has shown multiple regime shifts earlier; to balance responsiveness to the recent high-variance December demand (including a 499 spike in P42) while avoiding overreacting to a single outlier, use an EWMA for mu_hat with gamma=0.3 to weight recent periods more. For volatility, use recent_N with N=7 to capture the recent high variability (covers ~7 most recent demand observations). These choices align supply coverage with the inferred 3-period lead time and trade service level vs. holding cost by smoothing the demand forecast but using recent volatility for safety.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has spiked (Periods 40\u201344 mean \u2248200/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=680. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I set mu_hat explicit=800 (=4 periods \xd7 ~200/wk) so base-stock covers four weeks (review+lead) of elevated demand; with in-transit=680 this yields a modest replenishment. sigma_hat default lets the OR engine compute uncertainty from full history. This balances service (cover the 4-period elevated demand) while avoiding excessive additional holding given limited profit margin.

Recent demand (Periods 40\u201345 = 154,130,499,94,121,126) is elevated and volatile around the holiday window; use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the base-stock to the latest regime and capture current volatility.

Historical concluded lead times recently include multiple 3-period observations (e.g., P40\u2192P43, P36\u2192P39) and some 2/1 variability; given repeated 3-period arrivals and past lost shipments, I set L explicitly to 3 to avoid under-ordering. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime over the review+lead window, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility.
