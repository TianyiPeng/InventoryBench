Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (weekly). Recent demand shows an upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (series: 48, 82, 59). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead periods. No concluded arrivals exist to infer a lead-time change, so use the promised lead time. To capture the recent higher demand level, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (regime length=3). This biases base-stock toward higher service while the holding cost ($1) and profit ($4) keep target service high (q\u22480.8). No evidence of lost shipments or sustained lead-time change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand (Period 1 sold=67) is above the 5-sample historical mean (\u224842.4) but is a single-period blip\u2014no sustained regime change detected. Promised lead time is 2; the order placed in Period 1 (92 units in-transit) is expected to arrive later (no concluded arrivals yet), so this is consistent with promised L=2. Using default methods keeps the backend forecast anchored to the full-sample mean ((1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility, which is conservative given limited evidence of a persistent demand shift. Pipeline (92) is currently below the default (1+L)-period demand forecast, so the OR engine will top up subject to its cap; this balances service level risk against holding cost given the lack of multi-period confirmation of higher demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical weekly samples (2019-01) show mean demand \u224842.4/week. No concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1/P2 could still be in-transit given promised L=2), so do not revise lead time. Pipeline inventory =183 units, on-hand=0; pipeline > expected (1+L)*mean demand, so no upshift in forecast needed. Use promised lead time and default demand statistics to let OR engine compute base-stock while capping orders.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3) = 67,71,54 (mean=64). On-hand=0, in-transit=192 (orders from P1-P3). Promised L=2 but no concluded arrivals for orders placed P1-P3 (total ordered=192) by Period3 conclude, suggesting actual lead time \u22653 or lost shipments. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline. Demand forecast: use recent_N (N=3) to capture the clear upward regime (mean=64) and scale by (1+L)=4 \u2192 mu_hat based on last 3 periods. Volatility: use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability. These parameters increase on-order coverage for the longer inferred lead time and raise safety stock via recent demand/variance while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand weeks.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed Periods 1-3 (total ordered=192) have not concluded by Period3; expected arrival by P3 if promised L=2. Evidence suggests actual lead time >=3 or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $249.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): on-hand=23, in-transit=180. Historical weekly demand samples mean=42.4. Period4 conclude shows an arrival of 91 units (ordered P2, lead_time=2) so at least some orders follow promised L=2. Some earlier orders were delayed but latest evidence matches promised lead time. I therefore use L default (promised=2). With L=2 I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of persistent lead-time change.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period2 order arrived Period4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=180. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-5) = [67,71,54,68,54], recent mean=62.8 units \u2014 materially higher than the historical sample mean (42.4). One concluded arrival shows actual lead time = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4); earlier missing arrivals suggest past lost/delayed shipments but P4 arrival confirms promised L=2 is valid now. I choose L=default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base stock appropriate for the new higher-demand regime and accounts for recent variance; this raises orders to avoid stockouts given on-hand=0 and 180 in-transit. This balances higher service level (profit $4/unit) against holding cost $1/unit by adapting forecasts to the sustained demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period2 order arrived Period4); Recent demand regime shift: Periods 1-5 avg demand=62.8 vs historical sample mean=42.4 (+~48%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4) but earlier missing arrivals may reflect lost shipments; insufficient sustained evidence to change lead-time belief, so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand regime elevated: Periods 1-5 average demand ~62.8 vs historical sample mean ~42.4 (+~48%) sustained over 5 periods\u2014use recent_N=5 to capture higher demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat. These parameters raise base-stock to protect service level while acknowledging holding cost via OR backend cap.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical samples show a sustained higher-demand regime vs original sample mean (recent avg \u2248 58\u201363 vs historical 42). Lead-time observations consistently support L=2. To protect service while limiting holding cost, set L by observed lead times (calculate). Use recent demand (last 5 periods) to capture the upward regime for mu_hat and matching recent volatility for sigma_hat so base-stock reflects current higher demand rather than long-run lower mean.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has shifted materially above historical sample mean: P1-P8 avg demand \u224863.4 vs historical sample mean 42.4 (+~50%). On-hand=0, in-transit=180 (sufficient pipeline for upcoming periods). Two concluded arrivals indicate actual observed lead times = 2 periods; no sustained evidence to override promised lead time. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (confirmed =2). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (uses the last 8 periods' demands to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=8) so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated demand while relying on observed lead-time confirmations to avoid overreacting to earlier lost-shipment noise.

On-hand=0, in-transit=208 \u2014 pipeline sufficient but note past delayed arrivals resolved showing actual lead time =2. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed arrivals show 2).

These parameters tell the OR backend to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand and volatility, raising replenishment to meet the higher running demand while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=180 (large pipeline). Recent observed demand is elevated vs historical: last 5 periods demand mean = 61 (P6-10 = 49,59,85,57,55). Lead time observations are mixed but recent concludes confirm mostly 2-period behavior; promised lead time=2. I choose L=default (use promised 2). To reflect the recent higher demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit quantity will cap new orders via the OR engine cap, limiting overstock and holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical concluded lead times show variability (recent concluded leads = 2,2,1). Demand has shifted higher vs historical sample; recent 5-period mean ~61.6, consistent with earlier carry-over. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture recent lead-time variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent stable high-demand regime (last 5 periods: P7-P11). This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given a multi-period pipeline of 204 units and some overdue arrivals in history.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=205 (this pipeline likely covers multiple future periods). Recent concluded lead times observed = {2,2,1} so I choose to let backend compute the average observed L. Demand has shifted above historical samples; I use the last 5 concluded demand observations (Periods 8-12: 85,57,55,52,45; mean\u224858.8) to set mu_hat and recent volatility for sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects current regime. Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat adapts to the new higher-demand regime while keeping holding risk reasonable given substantial in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=181. Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,1,2] (avg 1.75) with majority =2; recent demand (Periods 9-13) = [57,55,52,45,37], showing a downward shift vs earlier spikes. To reflect the recent realized lead-time evidence while weighting freshest demand, I set L via recent_N on the last 4 observed lead times (captures the 2,2,1,2 pattern). For demand I use recent_N over the last 5 demand periods to target current lower demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N over 5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (using recent lead-time evidence) and holding cost (reducing forecast to recent lower demand).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent observed demands (P10-P14 = 55,52,45,37,45) show a lower recent mean (~46.8) than the earlier spike; multiple concluded arrivals since P4 consistently show ~2-period lead times with one 1-period outlier. On-hand=0, in-transit=180 which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at the recent demand rate. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures occasional 1-period outlier but bias toward 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of the last 5 demand samples (adapts to the recent downshift). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices keep targets responsive to the recent lower demand while acknowledging confirmed ~2-period lead time and avoid over-ordering given 180 units already in transit.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=180. Observed concluded lead times: mostly 2 periods (P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13, P12->P14) with one 1-period (P9->P10) \u2014 average lead time should reflect observed history. Recent demand has fallen from the early-period spike; last 5 demands (Periods 11-15 = 52,45,37,45,45) average ~44.8. To be responsive to the recent lower regime while using observed lead-time data, set L using calculated average of observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods to capture the current demand level and volatility. This balances service (cover (1+L) periods of current demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 11: avg P11-15 = 44.8 vs earlier P1-5 = 62.8 (~-28.6%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=180. Historical samples show higher recent demand than original small-sample history; recent 5-period demand (Periods 12-16 = 45,37,45,45,68) avg=48.0, which is a moderate, sustained uplift vs historical sample mean (42.4) but lower than the earlier short-lived high regime. Lead-time conclues repeatedly indicate actual lead time = promised 2 periods, so use default L. To capture the most relevant demand signal, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 12-16) so the OR engine will size base stock to current observed demand and volatility while respecting promised lead time and capping policy. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit volume uncertainty) against holding cost.

Concluded arrivals show observed lead times = {2,2,1,2,2} -> average ~1.8, so using calculate to let backend set L from observed data. Recent demand appears lower than the early high regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 13-17) = [37,45,45,68,37], mean=46.4. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current lower-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility; this avoids overstocking given substantial pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has fallen from the earlier high regime: last 5 observed demands (Periods 15-19) = [45,68,37,21,38], avg \u2248 41.8, below the earlier P1-5 avg of 62.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=180 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,1,2,2] (avg 1.8) \u2014 majority support a 2-period lead time. To reflect the recent lower demand regime while keeping responsiveness to pipeline, I set L by calculate (let backend averages observed lead times) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (use last 5 demand periods) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most recent regime. This reduces target base stock to match the cooler recent demand while the large in-transit inventory limits new ordering risk.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=180. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-periods recently; no new sustained lead-time change. Recent demand is volatile with a large spike in Period20; to remain responsive I target the most recent demand pattern. Set L=default (promised 2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the last 5 observed demands (Periods 16-20), so the OR backend adjusts orders to recent demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2,2} \u2192 average ~1.8; use calculated average to let backend adapt to observed reality. Recent demand has shifted versus historical samples; last 5 realized demands (Periods17-21 = 37,21,38,89,110) show a higher and more volatile regime, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current mean/variance. This raises target base-stock to protect service given large recent spikes while sigma_hat recent_N captures volatility to avoid excessive overstock. Parameters chosen to balance higher service level (protect vs stockouts from recent spikes) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=233. Recent demand has spiked (Periods 20-22: 89,110,169). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2,2} (avg=1.8) so I use calculated lead time to let backend average evidence. To capture the recent upward demand regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (smooths last 5 realized demands including the spike). These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during the detected surge while the calculated L reflects observed deliveries and guards against assuming the promised L blindly; using recent_N for volatility and mean helps the OR engine balance the higher profit vs holding cost amid elevated demand and large in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: New demand spike starting Period 20: avg P20-22 = 122.7 (89,110,169) \u2014 sustained 3 periods and ~+174% vs earlier sample mean of 42.4.

Observed concluded lead times vary (1s and 2s); I let backend compute average lead time from observations (calculate). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=4 (the detected recent high-demand regime length = 4) so the OR engine sizes base-stock and safety stock to cover the current high-demand regime while accounting for pipeline (on-hand 0, in-transit 290).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has spiked and sustained: P20-24 demands = [89,110,169,107,106], mean ~116.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=407 units which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of recent demand if L=2 (3*116.2\u2248348.6). Observed concluded lead times are mostly 2; no strong sustained deviation from promised L=2. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine builds a base-stock sized to current spike; keep L as default (promised=2) so the backend uses contractual lead time while in-transit stock is monitored for any missing shipments.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=407 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers upcoming demand but many past orders showed variable lead times (1\u20132) with majority 2. Recent demand spike (Periods 20\u201322) is sustained 3 periods and more recent weekly demands (P23\u2013P25 = 107,106,68) remain elevated vs long-run sample mean. To balance service vs holding cost: keep promised lead time (default) for OR engine consistency, but use a recent-window demand estimate (last 3 weeks) to capture the recent elevated regime when computing base-stock; use the same recent window for volatility to reflect short-term variability.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=51, in-transit=297. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence: 2,2,1,2,2,2,1,3) with recent average \u22482; recent demand has shifted up starting Period 20 (P20-26 demands: 89,110,169,107,106,68,59). To capture the recent regime I set L by recent lead-time evidence and forecast demand using the last 5 demand periods. L uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time average (2). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) so the OR backend builds base stock on the current higher-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5 demands \u2248 3*101.8). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This combination raises target stock to protect service during the sustained spike while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-sizing for longer lost-shipment scenarios.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): recent demand spike since Period 20 persists; recent 8-period mean >> historical. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133), average ~1.875 \u2192 use calculated average lead time. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=318 provides pipeline cover but some past shipments showed delays; to capture the recent high demand I use a recent_N forecast over the last 8 periods (P20\u2013P27) for mean and volatility so base_stock reflects current elevated demand while L is set by observed average lead time. This balances service (avoid stockouts in spike) vs holding cost by using recent data rather than long-run mean.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=341. Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed 1\u20133), so use computed average lead time to let backend infer typical L from data. Recent demand (Periods 24\u201328 = 106,68,59,55,57) is higher than the original small-sample historic mean; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime. This ensures base_stock and caps reflect recent elevated demand while the backend reconciling lead time from concluded history manages variable arrivals. In-transit (341) likely covers multiple future periods but may include delayed shipments; using recent demand prevents understocking if arrivals are slow or some shipments are lost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=341 \u2014 large pipeline but mixed past lead-times (observed: 2 mostly, occasional 1 and 3). Use calculated average lead time to capture realized variability. Demand has shifted since early periods (spike around P20-22) and since P23 demand settled to a new lower post-spike regime; recent 7-week window (P23-29) represents the current regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect current mean/volatility over the review+lead horizon so the OR backend sizes base-stock to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost given the sizable in-transit inventory and recent demand regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=5, in-transit=297. Recent concluded lead times show variability with several 3-period arrivals in the last 5 concludes (P23->P26 L=3, P27->P30 L=3, P28->P30 L=2); average of the most recent 3 observed lead times \u22482.67 so I use recent_N (N=3) to capture this longer-than-promised tail. Recent demand has cooled from the spike around Periods 20\u201322; the last 5 demand samples (P26\u2013P30 = 59,55,57,49,39) average \u224851.8, so I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current lower regime and avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture volatility in the same recent window. These choices reduce target base-stock compared with using the full historical mean, improving profit per unit while keeping service for current demand levels and accounting for longer/variable lead times.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=297 (large pipeline). Recent observed lead times show variability with last three concluded LTs = 3,3,2 \u2192 average ~2.67; choose recent_N=3 to capture current slower delivery. Recent demand has moderated from earlier spikes; last 5 demands (P27-31) = 55,57,49,39,29 (avg 45.8). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility. These settings (L\u22482.67, mu_hat based on recent 5, sigma_hat based on recent 5) steer the OR engine to target (1+L)-period cover using current demand evidence while avoiding excess additional ordering given the large in-transit balance.

Recent observed lead times have varied (1\u20133); last 5 observed lead times avg \u22482.4 so I use recent_N for L with N=5 to capture this upward skew. Recent demand has cooled from earlier spikes; last 5 demands (P28\u2013P32 = 57,49,39,29,31) average \u224841 \u2014 close to historical baseline \u2014 so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current lower regime and recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=297. Observed lead times from concluded arrivals average ~2.0; recent demand is volatile with a large single-period spike in Period 33 (142) but that spike is not yet sustained. To balance service vs holding cost while accounting for recent higher short-run demand, set L to calculated average (2). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 29-33) and capture short-run elevated mean. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep the OR engine's base-stock responsive to recent demand without overreacting to a single-period spike; existing in-transit (297) will be compared to the computed base-stock by the backend when determining final order.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times vary (1,2,3); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded history to reflect this variability. For demand forecast use recent_N N=5 to capture the latest regime including the spike while keeping sample size \u22653. Use sigma recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep mu_hat tied to the most recent demand regime and let L reflect historical lead-time variability so the OR engine caps/positions orders against the large in-transit pipeline and balances service vs holding cost.

Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) average 2.0 periods (samples: 2,2,1,2,2,2,1,3,3,2) so I use calculate for L to reflect observed mean. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods P31-35 = 29,31,142,63,44) has mean 61.8, so I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the current higher-volatility regime. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to let the OR engine compute volatility from these same recent samples. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the recent uptick/spike while relying on observed lead time average to avoid over-ordering for presumed longer L or lost shipments.

Observed concluded lead times = {1,2,3} but average of concluded samples = 2 \u2192 choose calculated L to reflect empirical mean. Recent demand shows a modest regime (most recent 5 periods demands = [31,142,63,44,47], mean \u224865.4) so use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current demand level and volatility and to avoid being pulled by older regimes. These settings give the OR backend a lead time-aligned forecast and recent-demand-driven safety stock to balance service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of concluded lead times \u22482 \u2192 choose calculate to align L with observed shipments. Given large in-transit and no clear new sustained demand regime since prior insights, use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples). This keeps ordering conservative (matches observed L=2) while letting the OR engine size base-stock from full-sample stats and the large pipeline to avoid overstocking versus holding costs.

Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods P34-38 = 63,44,47,40,46) shows a modestly higher/stable level vs long-run samples; use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, balancing service level with holding cost given large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=297. Historical observed lead times average 2.0 (multiple concluded arrivals with W={2,2,1,2,2,2,1,3,3,2} \u2192 mean 2.0). Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 35-39) = {44,47,40,46,30} indicating a recent mean \u224841.4. With promised L=2 and substantial pipeline (297 units) we should not inflate demand forecast \u2014 use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) so the OR backend reduces new orders and avoids excess holding cost. Use calculated lead time (average observed =2) so the backend aligns base stock with recent actual lead-time evidence. Sigma set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility rather than historical high spikes.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=297 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1\u20133); many past confirms show L\u22482 but some shipments took 3. To let backend use empirical actual lead time, I choose L=calculate (average of observed concluded lead times). Recent demand has moderated versus earlier spikes; the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36\u201340 = 47,40,46,30,22) average ~37, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to avoid over-ordering for past spikes. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so variability reflects the most recent regime. These choices reduce target base stock and cap ordering given the large in-transit volume, balancing service level versus holding cost and guarding against excess inventory from earlier spikes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=297. Recent concluded arrivals (periods up to P30) show variable lead times (1\u20133), average \u22482.1 \u2192 use calculated average lead time. Demand has fallen over recent weeks (Periods 37\u201341 demands = 40,46,30,22,18); this low-demand regime is sustained for 5 periods, so forecast using the most recent 5 periods to avoid overstock given holding cost. I choose L by 'calculate' (uses observed lead times), mu_hat and sigma_hat by 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime and tighten volatility estimate. This balances service vs. holding cost given large in-transit volume that may already cover upcoming demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=297. Promised L=2 but historical arrivals show mixed lead times (observed 1\u20133, some late/lost); recent concludes include multiple 2\u20133 period observations. Pipeline (297) provides substantial cover vs recent weekly demand (~48.5 over last 10 weeks) but arrival timing uncertainty remains. I set L="calculate" to let backend estimate average observed lead time from concluded history (captures mixed 1\u20133 signals). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility to the last 10 observed weekly demands (periods 33\u201342) \u2014 this emphasizes the most recent regime while avoiding older spikes. This balances service (using recent higher mean) against holding cost given large in-transit stock and lead-time variability.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09): on-hand=0, in-transit=297. Historical concluded lead times cluster at 2 (observed sample avg \u22482.0), so use calculated lead time to reflect observed behavior. Recent demand has dropped into December: last 5 demands (Periods 39-43) = [30,22,18,33,9], mean=22.4. With (1+L)=3 this implies a forecasted review+lead demand ~67.2. I therefore set L via observed-average (calculate) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize recent low seasonal demand; this keeps base-stock moderate and avoids excess holding given holding cost >0. Missing/late shipments are already reflected in observed lead-time calculation.

Recent demand (Periods 33-44) averaged ~41.8, similar to original sample mean (42.4), so use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility. These choices align backend base-stock calculation with observed lead time and recent demand, while the large in-transit suggests upcoming arrivals will cover the (L+1) review horizon; using calculated L prevents under-ordering if occasional 3-period arrivals reappear.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent weekly demand has fallen sharply vs mid-year spikes; last 5 concluded demands (P41-45) = [18,33,9,8,20], mean=17.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=297 (large pipeline). Promised lead time remains 2 periods and recent concluded arrivals support using the promised lead time. To avoid overstocking given heavy in-transit inventory and low recent demand, I use a recent_N forecast based on the last 5 periods to capture the current low-demand regime. mu_hat set via recent_N (N=5) gives (1+L)\xd7mean focused on recent weeks; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) captures recent volatility. This reduces ordering aggressiveness vs using full-sample means and helps the OR backend lower holding costs while maintaining service for observed low demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=297. Promised lead time=2 and recent concluded arrivals consistently show L=2 (multiple confirmations), so keep L as default (promised). Recent demand has dropped sharply in late Dec (Periods 42-46: 33,9,8,20,17). To avoid excess holding cost over the holiday lull while pipeline is sizeable (297 units), set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the lower regime. Therefore: L=default; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 (captures P42-46 mean); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 for matching recent volatility. This reduces order quantity and holding risk while still allowing the backend to aim for required service given the large in-transit volume.
