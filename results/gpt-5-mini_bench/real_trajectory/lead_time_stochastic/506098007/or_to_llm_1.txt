Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so entire upcoming (L+1)=3 periods' exposure must be covered by new order. Demand signal: historical weekly samples show a clear upward shift starting 2019-01-21: last three weeks = {48,82,59} => avg=63 units/week vs early Jan two weeks avg=11.5.

Adjustment decision: because on-hand/pipeline=0, recent 3-week mean=63 (much higher than earlier weeks) and an imminent Valentine spike, I increase supply above OR to avoid stockouts. Tradeoff: holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit => critical fractile high (q=0.8) so bias toward stocking.
