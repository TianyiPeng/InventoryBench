Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples: [35,42,47,58,166] \u2014 a recent spike (166) exists but is single-week, not a sustained regime change. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; promised lead time is 2. Given limited evidence of a persistent shift, use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses all historical data. This balances service vs holding cost conservatively while waiting for confirmation of any regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-02-18: recent demand has jumped (2019-02-04=166, Period1 demand=187) indicating an upward shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (order from P1 not yet concluded) so pipeline likely insufficient for current demand. I keep L as default (promised=2) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to emphasize the recent higher-demand regime while meeting the minimum N=3 requirement. I use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility from the same window. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period given the observed spike while avoiding overcommitment absent confirmed lead-time changes.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=411. Periods 1\u20132 conclude show ordered shipments but arrived=0, so no concluded arrivals to infer a lead-time change or lost shipments yet. No sustained (\u22653 period) demand regime shift detected despite a single high sample (166); historical samples are limited. To avoid overreacting, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This keeps service level aligned with profit/holding trade-off while avoiding overstocking on weak evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand: P1=187, P2=138, P3=90 (downward trend). On-hand=0, in-transit=411 (includes orders placed in P1\u2013P2 that have not yet concluded). Promised lead time = 2 but no concluded arrivals yet; cannot confirm actual lead time. To react to recent demand decline while preserving service, use promised lead time (default L=2) so OR backend assumes 2. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned with near-term observed demand, reducing holding cost risk given large in-transit volume while allowing backend safety stock calculation to maintain service.

Daily Reward (R_t): $159.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). On-hand=169, in-transit=235. History shows one confirmed arrival: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 \u2192 observed lead time = 2 (matches promised). There is an older order (Period 1, 160 units) still in-transit which may indicate a delayed/lost shipment, but evidence is not yet sustained. Using default methods keeps the backend anchored to promised lead time and full-sample demand stats while we gather more evidence before altering estimates.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent on-hand=94, in-transit=235. History shows an arrival on Period 4 of the order placed on Period 2 with observed lead_time=2 (so actual lead_time confirmed as 2). Demand has dropped from very high early values (P1-2 avg=162.5) to a lower regime in P3-5 (avg=82.3). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmation of 2). For demand I use recent_N N=3 (Periods 3-5) to capture the new lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)*mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps service high enough for the new regime while avoiding excess holding given holding cost >0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: avg decreased from 162.5 (P1-2) to 82.3 (P3-5) (-49%)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has settled lower: Periods 3-6 demands = [90,82,75,74], mean=80.25 (carry-over previously noted a drop at P3). On-hand=20, in-transit=235 (pipeline ample but arrivals have been irregular in past; only one observed arrival shows lead_time=2). I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual lead time (one observed lead_time=2 -> calculate). Demand forecast uses recent_N over the most recent stable low-demand regime (Periods 3-6) to capture the new lower mean: mu_hat recent_N N=4 => (1+L)*mean of last 4 samples. Volatility is estimated from the same recent window to reflect current variability: sigma_hat recent_N N=4. These choices bias the base-stock toward the lower recent demand to avoid excess holding cost while acknowledging pipeline on-hand coverage and confirmed lead_time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has been lower since Period 3 (P3-7 average \u2248 84 vs earlier higher levels). Observed concluded lead time evidence (Period 4 conclude: order on P2 arrived, lead_time=2) matches promised lead time; no sustained evidence of a different lead time. I therefore keep L at default (promised=2). For demand I detect a sustained regime from Period 3\u20137 (length=5); use recent_N with N=5 to base mu_hat on the most recent low-demand regime. Volatility likely changed with the regime, so set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent std. These choices reduce overstock versus using the earlier high-demand mean while preserving service given observed lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand 0, in-transit 268. Historical concludes show one confirmed observed lead time: order on Period 2 arrived Period 4 (lead_time=2). Recent demand regime decreased at Period 3 (previously noted), so use recent demand to set forecast. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect the confirmed 2-period observation. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 3\u20138) so the OR engine targets service for the lower recent mean while limiting holding cost given thin on-hand inventory and some overdue/lost shipments.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. On-hand 0, in-transit 272 (some past orders outstanding). Observed lead-time evidence: Period4 conclude shows an arrival for an order placed in Period2 with lead_time=2 \u2014 consistent with promised L=2, so use calculated average lead time. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period3 (Periods3-9: 90,82,75,74,99,93,59); I use a recent-window forecast to capture the lower recent mean and volatility. Therefore: L by 'calculate' (uses observed lead times); mu_hat and sigma_hat by 'recent_N' with N=7 to base (1+L)-period demand forecast on the last 7 demand observations, balancing service level against holding cost while being responsive to the sustained lower-demand regime. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments beyond using observed lead times.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=235. Historical concluded lead times: 2,2,1 (avg\u22481.67) and demand has been in a lower regime since Period 3 (per provided carry-over). I choose L as recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time samples rather than the promised 2, capturing the slight variability. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (most recent 8 periods) to base the (1+L)-period forecast on the current lower-demand regime and avoid up-weighting the early high-demand spikes. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to match volatility to the same recent window. These choices prioritize matching observed lead-time variability and recent lower-demand regime so the OR backend sets a conservative base-stock to balance service (profit $4) vs holding ($1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=258. Observed concluded lead times: orders placed P2\u2192arrived P4 (LT=2), P8\u2192P10 (LT=2), P9\u2192P10 (LT=1) \u2192 average ~1.67. Recent demand (last 6 concluded periods P6\u2013P11): [74,99,93,59,37,45], mean=67.83 \u2014 demand has been lower since the regime shift recorded previously. Given profit=$4 vs holding=$1 (high service target), I bias toward covering (1+L) periods of recent demand while not overstocking the large in-transit position. Therefore: estimate L from observed lead times (calculate average). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower recent demand; N=6 (covers the most recent 6 demand observations since the regime change). This yields mu_hat based on recent mean \xd7(1+L) and sigma_hat based on recent std\xd7sqrt(1+L), which balances higher service level (q\u22480.8) with lower recent demand to avoid excess holding given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=258 (multiple outstanding orders). Observed concluded lead times: P4 arrival (ordered P2) LT=2, P10 arrivals (ordered P8) LT=2 and (ordered P9) LT=1 => recent observed Ls = [2,2,1] (avg\u22481.67). Historical demand shows a sustained lower regime (carry-over insight from Period 6). To react to recent actual lead-time evidence while keeping some robustness, I set L using recent_N over the last 3 observed lead times. For demand I use a recent_N forecast (most recent 5 demand samples) to capture the post-changepoint lower regime and reduce exposure to older high-demand samples. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect current demand variability. These choices help the OR backend produce a base stock tuned to recent shorter-than-promised arrivals and to the confirmed lower-demand regime, balancing service level (by using observed L) and holding cost (by using recent lower mean).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). Recent observed arrivals show actual lead times = {2,2,1,2} (avg ~1.75) but majority are 2. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 3; recent 11-period mean (P3\u2013P13) ~71.9 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=235 (large pipeline). I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures the 1.75 signal). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=11 to anchor the (1+L)\xd7mean on the confirmed lower-demand regime (reduces overstating demand vs using all-history). For sigma_hat use recent_N N=11 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias orders toward the recent lower-demand regime while allowing the backend to account for lead-time estimate and pipeline, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Observed concluded lead times: mostly 2 periods (P2->P4, P8->P10, P11->P13) with one 1-period (P9->P10) \u2014 use averaged observed lead time. Recent realized demand (periods 10-14: 37,45,79,58,56) reflects the current lower regime noted in carry-over; use recent_N (N=5) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts reflect the current demand level and volatility while the OR backend will cap orders given the large in-transit. These choices avoid over-ordering beyond the 245 units already en route and align service-level vs holding cost tradeoff (profit=4, holding=1).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent realized demand (Periods 11-15) = [45,79,58,56,92]; longer-run samples show a lowered regime vs early spike. On-hand=0, in-transit=245 (pipeline large but arrivals not yet concluded). Promised lead time=2 and observed concluded lead times remain ~2 (P4, P10, P13 showed 2-period arrivals), so use default promised L. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime and capture current variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (recent_N N=5). This biases the OR base-stock toward current demand while keeping variability measured from recent volatility; this balances service level (reduce stockouts given pipeline) vs holding cost by avoiding inflation from early high outliers.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=245. Observed concluded lead times: {P4: order P2 \u2192 LT=2, P10: order P9 \u2192 LT=1, P13: order P11 \u2192 LT=2} (recent variability). Demand has been lower since Period 3 (carry-over insight). I set L by averaging the last 3 observed lead times to reflect recent variability. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the most recent 14 demand samples (covers the post-changepoint regime from P3 onward) so mu_hat captures the lower, more recent demand level across the review+lead window. I set sigma_hat using the same recent_N window to reflect current volatility. These choices bias stocking toward the recent lower-demand regime while acknowledging lead-time variability to avoid understock from underestimated lead time.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent weekly demand has been lower than early-period levels (carry-over noted: drop around Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=245 (large pipeline from earlier orders); some prior arrivals show lead times of 1\u20132 periods with majority 2. To reflect observed lead-time variability use averaged observed lead time. Demand forecasting will use recent data (post-changepoint) to capture the lower regime and avoid overstock given holding cost >0. Use recent_N=15 to cover the most recent sustained regime for both mean and volatility so the OR base-stock reflects current lower demand while accounting for variability and the substantial in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=245. Historical concluded lead times mostly 2 periods (observed P4: P2\u2192P4, P10: P8\u2192P10, P13: P11\u2192P13) with one 1-period observation; some orders remain in-transit long without conclusion, so use averaged observed lead time rather than promised blindly. Recent demand (Periods 14-18 = 56,92,46,37,43) shows a lower recent mean versus earlier high values, so I forecast using the most recent 5 samples to capture the current regime. Set L using calculate (average observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the backend bases base-stock on current demand regime and the pipeline reality; this reduces overstock risk given large in-transit and potential lost shipments while maintaining service for the recent demand level.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times (observed W={2,2,1,2}), so set L by calculating the average observed lead time to reflect slight variation. Recent demand is lower than early periods (carry-over noted); I use a recent_N forecast to focus the (1+L)-period mean on the post-changepoint regime (N=17 most recent samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the sustained lower demand and limits holding cost while preserving service. This balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost by reducing overstock risk given available pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 3 (user carry-over: avg dropped ~49%). On-hand=0, in-transit=245 (pipeline large but arrivals only visible when concluded). Observed concluded lead times: mostly 2 periods (one 1-period outlier). I therefore let the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate). For demand I target the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=18 (Periods 3\u201320) so mu_hat reflects the sustained lower mean across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Use recent_N N=18 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices keep safety stock aligned with the confirmed lower-demand regime while relying on observed lead-time behavior to adjust for occasional shorter arrivals, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 3 (carry-over previously recorded). On-hand=0, in-transit=245 (no new concludes indicating lead-time change). I keep L as default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to reflect the lower mean/volatility and avoid contamination from the early high-demand periods: choose N=19 (Periods 3\u201321 available). This sets mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 19 demand samples, which helps the OR backend compute a base-stock that matches the current lower-demand regime while accounting for lead time and holding cost trade-offs.

Recent demand (Periods 13-22) shows lower, variable weekly demand with mean ~42.6 over last 10 periods; prior carry-over notes a sustained drop at Period 3. Observed concluded lead times are mostly 2 (with occasional 1) so use promised/default lead time. To have the OR backend target recent demand patterns I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 weeks (recent_N N=10) so the base-stock reflects the current lower-demand regime while sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This leverages in-transit stock visibility and avoids overreacting to older high-demand samples.

Demand has been lower recently vs early periods (sustained lower weekly sales over many periods). To avoid overstock given holding cost and low recent demand, use an L estimate from observed lead times (calculate) and base demand on recent samples to reflect the lower regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to prioritize recent weeks (N=12 covers the most recent quarter of history), reducing forecast bias from earlier high-demand weeks. This balances service (capture in-transit + recent demand) while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent observed concluded lead times: P4 (2), P10 (2,1), P13 (2) \u2192 mostly 2 with one 1, and there is a large in-transit position (245) and on-hand=0. Many recent weekly demands have been low (June\u2013July mostly 15\u201360, summer window) versus earlier higher spring peaks; previous carry-over noted a sustained drop starting at Period 3. To be robust to the empirically observed lead time variability I use 'calculate' for L so the controller averages observed lead times. For demand I bias to recent weeks (summer regime) using recent_N N=10 to reflect the lower mean and reduce overstocking given holding cost. For volatility I also use recent_N N=10 so safety stock matches recent demand variability and the OR engine can cap orders appropriately given the large in-transit volume.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, In-transit=245 (outstanding arrivals from prior orders). Historical concluded lead times observed: 2 (P4: ordered P2), 2 & 1 (P10: ordered P8, P9), 2 (P13: ordered P11) \u2014 mostly 2. Demand regime dropped at Period 3 and has persisted; recent demand periods (P6\u2013P25) are lower and more variable than initial periods. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures occasional 1 but majority 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (captures the sustained lower-demand regime since Period 3, capped at 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the current lower-demand regime and avoids excess holding given holding cost >0. This balances service (avoid stockouts given 245 in-transit) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the recent 20-period regime rather than the early high-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=245. Historical concluded lead times observed = {2,2,1,2} (avg\u22481.75). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 3 (carry-over note). To reflect observed lead-time behavior use calculated average lead time; to capture the recent low-demand regime use recent_N on the last 20 samples for mean and volatility (caps and smoothing handled by OR engine). These settings keep orders responsive to the current low-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the substantial in-transit stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, In-transit=245 (large pipeline from prior orders). Historical concluded lead times are mostly 2 periods (P2->P4, P8->P10, P11->P13) with one 1-period sighting; no sustained lead-time drift. Recent demand has been lower since Period 3 (recorded previously). Given confirmed lead-time=2 evidence and no new demand regime change, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample stats while respecting the promised L. This balances service (use pipeline + base stock) against holding cost since holding cost is nontrivial ($1/unit) and in-transit is already high.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=259 \u2014 a large pipeline but no visible on-hand stock this period. Historical conclues show observed lead times mostly 2 (with one 1), so use observed-average lead time. Demand regime shifted down at Period 3 (carry-over noted): recent lower-demand regime persists. To avoid overstocking while protecting service, set L by calculating observed average lead time, and estimate demand and volatility from the most recent regime (use recent_N with N=20 to capture the last sustained low-demand periods). This lowers forecasted mu_hat compared with using all historical high early samples and uses recent volatility for safety.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=259. Concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times (observed W = 2,2,1,2) so I will let backend compute an average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate). Demand history shows no new sustained upward regime since prior carry-over; use default demand estimate ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) so the OR engine uses full-sample mean for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat. This balances service level (using observed lead-time evidence) with holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline (259 units) that may already cover upcoming demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=245. Historical concluded lead times are mainly 2 periods (observed P4, P10, P13, P30 arrivals), with one 1-period instance (P10). Recent demand has been in a lower regime versus very high early samples; last 10 concluded weekly demands (P21-P30) = [20,27,60,33,50,82,84,67,47,87] mean\u224854.7, which better reflects current demand than the full-sample mean. I keep L at the promised default (2) because concluded lead-time data is consistent with promised lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the current lower-demand regime (using the last 10 demand samples) so the OR backend sizes orders to cover (1+L) periods at the recent mean while controlling holding cost. This approach balances service (avoid large overstock given large in-transit) against holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16. On-hand=0, in-transit=245 (covers some upcoming demand but arrival confirmation delayed by observation lag). Observed concluded lead times: {2,2,1,2,2} \u2192 average \u22481.8, so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand (last 5 periods: P27\u2013P31 = 84,67,47,87,110) shows current mean ~79 units/week; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime. These choices keep base_stock tied to recent demand while letting OR backend use averaged observed lead time to balance service vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=272 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: {2,2,1,2,2} \u2192 average ~1.8; use calculated lead time to capture slight <2 bias. Recent demand (Periods 28-32): [67,47,87,110,78], mean=77.8 \u2014 recent regime after earlier drop is most relevant. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and avoid inflating by older high early samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand volatility. These parameters keep target base-stock responsive to the current lower-demand regime while recognizing in-transit stock; using recent stats reduces overstock risk given holding cost >0 and large existing pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. Recent demand has been higher and more variable since summer with confirmed regime shift (noted earlier) to a lower mean starting at Period 3; current on-hand=0, in-transit=272 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2,2} -> use backend-calculated average to let OR learn ~1.8 periods but keep calculation method to reflect actual observations. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent regime (captures last ~20 weekly demands) so the base-stock reflects current seasonal/regime behavior and recent variance while limiting influence of older pre-shift samples. This balances service (profit $4) vs holding ($1) given a large in-transit volume: recent-based demand estimates will avoid over-ordering if pipeline already covers upcoming demand and will adapt quickly if demand continues changing.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=272. Observed concluded lead times remain centered on 2 (multiple P->arrival pairs with lead_time=2 and one =1); no strong evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Recent weekly demand has been higher (Periods 28-34: 67,47,87,110,78,152,96 \u2014 recent mean elevated vs earlier regime). To prioritize service and capture recent demand uptick while controlling holding cost, I use promised lead time (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent window (N=8) to focus the forecast on the latest demand regime. This produces a (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflecting recent demand variability, improving service during the observed demand uptick while limiting excess inventory given holding cost $1 and profit $4.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent history shows on-hand=0, in-transit=289 \u2014 ample pipeline but some shipments have shown variable lead times (observed: 1,2,3). Observed lead times = [2,2,1,2,2,3], average = 2.0 so I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed average. Demand appears in a lower regime (previous carry-over insight: demand dropped ~49% at Period 3) so I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' to use full-sample statistics scaled by (1+L), avoiding overfitting to short bursts. This balances service (profit/holding ratio) while recognizing large in-transit inventory; defaults let the OR engine cap orders appropriately given the pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=245 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are observed with variable lead times (some 1\u20133 periods). Observed lead times = {2,2,1,2,2,3,1} -> average ~1.86; choose calculate to let backend use observed average. Demand has changed over the long history and recent weeks show higher, more volatile demand (several 70\u2013150 weeks); to prioritize recent demand while still smoothing noise I use an EWMA for mu_hat with moderate memory (gamma=0.3). Keep sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine retains standard uncertainty estimate; this combination raises base-stock enough to use the large in-transit while avoiding excessive overstock given holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 31\u201337 = 110,78,152,96,78,71,64) averages ~92.7; use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime and recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=285 units (large pipeline covering multiple periods of demand). Recent concluded lead-time observations are variable (1\u20133 periods). I choose to estimate L from recent observations to capture this variability (recent_N) so the OR engine considers the shorter/longer deliveries seen recently. Given large in-transit inventory, use default demand/volatility priors so backend uses full history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) and avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=285. Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (recent observed lead_times: P35->P36=1, P36->P38=1, P32->P35=3, earlier 2s), recent average shorter than promised 2. Demand in recent weeks (Periods 34-39 = 96,78,71,64,82,56) is moderate and lower than early-season spikes. To balance service vs holding cost: set L using recent lead-time samples (capture recent faster arrivals but still allow some variability), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand window (last 6 weeks) to reflect current regime and avoid overstocking from older high spikes. These choices keep the OR backend's base-stock and cap responsive to recent lower demand and modest lead-time variability while preserving service for near-term demand given 285 units in-transit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand (Periods 35-40) averages ~68.5/week; holiday season (late Nov) may increase demand, but recent six-week window is our best short-term anchor. On-hand=0, in-transit=285 \u2014 ample pipeline coverage for multiple weeks, but past arrivals show variable lead times (observed LT samples: 2,2,1,2,2,3,1,1) so use inferred LT rather than promised blindly. Set L via calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20133 period variability). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 demand samples (Periods 35-40) to reflect the current regime; this keeps target base-stock responsive to recent demand while backend will scale by (1+L). No explicit reduction for potential holiday uplift \u2014 pipeline is large (285) so we avoid over-ordering now.

Recent concluded lead times have varied (1\u20133) but no sustained shift vs promised L=2. Demand history shows a sustained lower regime since Period 3 (carry-over insight recorded previously). To avoid overreacting to noisy lead-time variation and because pipeline is already large, use default methods so the OR engine uses promised L=2 and long-run demand stats; this balances service (utilize existing in-transit) against holding cost.

Recent demand (last weeks) around ~56\u201366/wk; to reflect recent regime I use recent-window estimates. Choose L as recent_N (N=5) to capture recent variability in actual lead times (~1.8 \u2192 informs backend vs promised=2). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=20) to capture recent demand regime (stable mid-high weekly demand) across review+lead periods. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings balance service (using recent lead-time estimate and recent demand mean) against holding costs given large in-transit volume.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent demand (Periods 39-43) averages ~55.8 units/week; historical series shows a sustained down-shift identified earlier (carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=285 \u2014 pipeline is large and likely covers multiple review+lead periods, so we can avoid inflating forecasts. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed lead times ~1.75 => use 'calculate' so backend infers average lead time from observations. For demand and volatility, use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 concluded demand observations) to capture the current lower regime and avoid contamination from earlier high-demand periods. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with current demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=285. Historical concluded lead times available: {2,2,1,2,2,3,1,1} (avg \u22481.75). Recent demand (last 8 concluded periods P37\u2013P44) = [64,82,56,60,52,66,45,99], mean \u224865.5 and still somewhat volatile. I choose L by aggregating observed lead times (backend 'calculate') to reflect actual avg lead time \u22481.75 (promised=2 but observations show variation). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent regime and seasonality into (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat also recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias the base-stock toward current demand levels while accounting for observed lead-time variability and avoiding overweighting older higher-demand samples.

Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,2,2,3,1,1} (avg=1.75) so I use 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time. Recent demand has risen in the last ~10 weeks (weeks ~44-45 showing ~99-106), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the holiday uplift while limiting exposure to older low-demand regime. This favors higher service (profit $4 vs holding $1) but uses recent sample window to avoid excessive inventory given large in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=285. Historical concluded arrivals show varied lead times (observed W={2,2,1,2,2,3,1,1}, avg\u22481.75) and multiple missing arrivals (some orders never concluded) indicating unreliable shipments. Demand experienced a sustained drop starting at Period 3 (carry-over insight already recorded). To account for actual lead-time evidence I set L='calculate' (use observed average). To make demand forecast responsive to the recent lower-demand regime and to avoid overstock given large pipeline and $1 holding cost, I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples. This balances service level against holding cost given uncertain arrivals and confirmed lower demand.
