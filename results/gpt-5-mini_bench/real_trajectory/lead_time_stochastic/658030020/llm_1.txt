Demand analysis: recent history shows weekly demands = [35,42,47,58,166] with the 166 on 2019-02-04 a single large spike (likely promo or one-off). Recent stable baseline before spike \u2248 40\u201360 units/week. No sustained regime shift (spike is isolated). Lead time / pipeline: promised lead time = 2 periods; no concluded arrivals observed yet and in-transit=0, so treat promised L=2 as working but unconfirmed. Decision logic: need to cover current period demand (occurs after decision) plus the next L periods => (L+1)=3 periods of demand. Use conservative baseline forecast ~50 units/week (midpoint of recent stable range) to avoid overstock from one-off spike. Order = 3 \xd7 50 = 150 units. This balances service level (low stockouts) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) given profit $4/unit sold. No overdue or in-transit shipments to adjust for.",
