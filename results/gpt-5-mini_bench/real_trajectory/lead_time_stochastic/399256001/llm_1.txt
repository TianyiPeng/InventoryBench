======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas; no strong sustained uplift expected for ladies denim). Demand history: recent weeks (P41\u2013P46) = [209,467,181,205,185,148] \u2014 aside from a one-week spike P42 (467), recent typical weekly demand \u2248190\u2013210. Lead time / pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=2700. Past evidence shows actual lead time can be 1\u20132 and some shipments lost, but most recent confirmed LT=2 earlier; P44 order (820) has not concluded yet. Decision logic: promised lead_time=2 implies we must cover (L+1)=3 future periods of demand. Estimated 3-week demand \u2248 3\xd7210 \u2248 630 units. In-transit (2700) already far exceeds this need; placing more risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while marginal profit ($19) does not justify extra inventory given ample pipeline. Therefore place no new order this period.",
