Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time = 2 periods; no concluded arrivals yet to contradict this, and in-transit = 0, on-hand = 0.

This balances service-level (avoid lost sales around Valentine) against holding cost (HC=$1/unit/period is small vs profit=$19).

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date 2019-12-30 \u2014 just after peak holiday weeks; demand spiked in Nov/Dec (Periods 42-45) and has been volatile. Demand analysis: recent weekly demands (P42\u2013P46) = 542, 297, 132, 475, 271 \u2014 clearly elevated and variable but trending off peak. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=1695 units which is enough to cover multiple weeks even at elevated demand (1695 / 300 \u2248 5.6 weeks at a conservative 300/wk forecast). Lead time / reliability: observed LT has varied (1\u20133 periods) and some shipments experienced delays earlier; because we already have a large in-transit pipeline, we avoid adding more exposure to lost/delayed shipments. Final order logic: place no new order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and risk of lost shipments; rely on in-transit stock to satisfy demand and reassess next period when arrivals are observed.",
