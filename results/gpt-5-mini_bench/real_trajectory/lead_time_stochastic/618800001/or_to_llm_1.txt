  "rationale": "Observed facts: on-hand=0, in-transit=305. Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed 2 in Period 4 for P2 order, but several 1-period arrivals afterwards); carry-over insight already records lead time=2 historically, so treat lead time as uncertain (1\u20132) but expect some of the 305 in-transit to arrive soon. Demand has trended sharply up recently (period demands: 204, 257, 394 in the last three concluded periods) vs. earlier ~150\u2013190; OR recommendation (304) uses promised L and historical averages and caps the order. Risk trade-off: placing a large order now when 305 units are already in-transit risks high holding cost ($1/unit/period) if many in-transit units arrive and demand mean reverts or the lead time is short. Pipeline coverage: with promised L=2, you should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand; even with elevated demand (conservatively assume next-period demand ~250), 305 in-transit plus any imminent arrivals likely cover the next 1\u20132 periods, and placing 304 now would double the pipeline and create large holding cost exposure. Decision: order 0 units. This avoids over-ordering given a large existing pipeline and uncertain/shorter realized lead times, while still allowing sales to reveal whether elevated demand persists; if demand continues high in next concluded periods, we will escalate orders next period.

Recent conclude messages (Periods 11 onward) show no arrivals despite large in-transit quantity, so there are many units still 'in-transit' (system reports 737) and some shipments may be delayed or unconfirmed. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 0, in-transit = 737. Historical demand since Period 13 is low (carry-over insight: sustained low regime ~30\u201370 units/week) except for a single extreme spike in Period 42 (demand=542) which aligns with Black Friday week (2019-11-25) and appears one-off rather than a new sustained regime. OR recommended 0 units; its baseline uses promised L=2 and historical data. Decision: do not order now. Rationale: the large in-transit volume (737) already covers multiple weeks of even elevated demand (737 >> typical weekly demand 30\u201370 and >> one-off spike 542), ordering more risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) while profit per unit is $19 but holding cost accumulates each period.
