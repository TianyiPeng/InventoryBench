Lead time & pipeline: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 2 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=2055 \u2014 with L=2 these in-transit units are expected to arrive in upcoming periods and will cover many weeks of demand. Cost tradeoff: Profit = $1/unit while holding cost = $1/unit/period, so carrying extra inventory yields no net benefit and inflates holding losses. Action logic: Do not place additional orders now; let the large in-transit pipeline arrive and observe demand/arrivals before replenishing to avoid heavy holding costs and risk of lost shipments.",
