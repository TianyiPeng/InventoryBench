Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly samples: [3,175,168,106,278] (last sample 2019-02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviation or lost shipments. Promised lead time is 2; no evidence to override. I choose default L so backend uses promised lead time. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost and limited history. No new sustained demand/lead-time changepoints detected.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand samples (3,175,168,106,278) give a mean ~146 units/week. On-hand=0 plus in-transit=313 (ordered in P1) \u2014 P1 conclude shows arrived=0 so the P1 shipment is not yet confirmed; this could be on-time (arrives later) or delayed/lost but evidence is insufficient to change lead-time. Use promised lead time (default) so backend computes (1+L)*mean and volatility from full sample set. This balances service (covering current + lead periods) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean=146 units/week and high variance (std\u2248101). On-hand=0, in-transit=494 (matches orders placed in P1=313 and P2=181); these are not yet concluded as arrivals, so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipments. I retain the promised lead time and use default demand estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock: L kept as default (promised=2) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This favors meeting high recent demand (reducing lost-sales given current empty on-hand) while relying on the backend cap to limit excessive single-period receipts and holding cost exposure.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=559 (matches orders 313+181+65); no concluded arrivals -> cannot confirm actual lead time, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (Period1-3 concludes: 258, 315, 291) is materially above earlier sample mean (2019-01-07..2019-02-04 mean=146), indicating a sustained upward regime. I set L to default (use promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (N=3 = three most recent periods). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility, improving service while acknowledging higher holding cost (profit=holding so q=0.5), balancing fill rate vs inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25: recent avg=288 vs prior sample avg=146 (+97%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=683. Historical concluded lead-time evidence: one arrival (Period2\u2192Period4) => lead_time=2. Recent demand regime shift confirmed (Period1-3 conclude demands 258,315,291 and Period4 demand 335; recent elevated avg ~288 vs prior sample avg 146). Because demand has clearly shifted upward and is sustained for 3 periods, set L by observed lead times and set demand estimates from the recent regime (3 periods) so the OR engine targets higher base-stock while cap limits orders given large pipeline and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=941. Observed arrival in Period 4 confirms actual lead time = 2 (ordered P2 arrived P4), consistent with promised lead time; some earlier orders (P1,P3) remain unconfirmed and may be lost but insufficient to declare a lead-time change. Recent demand is in a higher regime (sustained high demands in recent periods), so I use recent_N=5 to capture the new higher mean/volatility over the most recent 5 samples. This increases target base-stock to protect service while keeping cap constraints; default L preserves backend assumption of promised lead time so arrivals align with observed P2\u2192P4 confirmation.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=683. Recent concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6) -> use average to let backend infer current effective lead time. Demand has risen and remained elevated across the last 6 concluded periods (demands: P1..P6 = 258,315,291,335,332,294); use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher regime and capture current mean/volatility. This raises base_stock to prioritize service given equal profit and holding cost while the calculated L and recent demand reduce stockouts from in-transit uncertainty.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=913 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4), 1 (P6) => variable but limited samples. Recent demand elevated: last 4 demand samples (P4\u2013P7 = 335,332,294,413) show a higher regime vs earlier history. To reflect short-term higher demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the latest regime. For L I choose 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (captures variability 2 and 1). This balances service (capture elevated recent demand) vs holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times recent sequence = [2,1,1] -> use recent average to capture variability. Demand recent 3 periods = [294,413,521], clear higher regime \u2014 use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend bases base-stock on the new higher mean and recent volatility. This balances service (avoid severe stockouts given large recent demand) while pipeline is large so orders will be moderated by cap.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand elevated and volatile (recent demands: 258,315,291,335,332,294,413,521,220) and prior carry-over noted a sustained regime shift starting 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=1228 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1} (orders concluded in Periods 4,6,8), so I use recent_N=3 to reflect the short-run average lead time ~1.33. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime while smoothing older low samples. Sigma also uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings signal the OR engine to size base-stock and cap using recent realized lead-time and the recent demand regime, balancing service (capture high recent demand) against holding cost given the large existing pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent on-hand=346, in-transit=683 (pipeline strong). Historical concluded lead times show mix of 1\u20132 periods (observed: 2,1,1,2,1) so use aggregate observed lead time to let backend capture the 1.4-ish realized mean. Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-02-11 (sustained) and recent periods remain elevated/variable (last 10 concluded demands range ~199\u2013521) so use a recent-N demand estimate (N=10) to reflect the newer regime while smoothing variability. Use default sigma (all-sample std scaled) so the OR engine uses full-sample volatility for safety. These choices keep orders conservative given sizeable pipeline and balance service vs. holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent realized lead times (from concluded arrivals) show variability: observed W = [2,1,1,2,1] \u2192 recent mean ~1.4; I use recent_N to capture this. Recent demand shows a higher regime vs early samples and more recent moderation: last 5 demands (Periods 7-11) = [413,521,220,199,176], mean=305.8 and high volatility. On-hand 170 + in-transit 683 = 853 units \u2014 ample pipeline but some shipments previously delayed/variable. Choices: set L by recent_N (N=5) to reflect actual observed lead-time mix (~1.4) rather than promised 2; set mu_hat by recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecast to the most recent regime (captures elevated but moderating demand); set sigma_hat by recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the recent higher-demand regime while acknowledging lead-time variability, balancing service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=1, in-transit=748. Recent concluded lead times observed = [2,1,1,2,1] (avg 1.4) so I use a recent average to capture current faster-than-promised behavior. Demand showed a sustained regime shift starting 2019-02-11 (noted in carry-over); therefore I rely on the most recent demand samples to capture the new higher mean and volatility. Using recent_N=5 for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat keeps the OR backend responsive to the new regime while preventing overreaction to a single period. This balances service (avoid stockouts with large in-transit) vs holding cost by anchoring to recent demand and observed lead time.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent observed lead times are mixed (observed W = 2,1,1,2,1 \u2192 avg ~1.4) while promised = 2. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 770 which is a large pipeline covering multiple review+lead periods; recent demands have moderated from prior spikes (recent demands: 199,176,169,111). I choose L by calculating the average of all observed lead times to let the OR engine adapt to the mixed/shorter realized lead times. For demand forecast and volatility I use the defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend uses the full sample history to smooth recent variability while the calculated L corrects for the observed lead-time mix. This balances service level (by shortening effective lead time) against holding cost given the large in-transit stock and recent lower demand.

Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=705. Historical concluded lead times: observed W = {2,1,1,2,1,2} (avg 1.5) so use calculated average lead time to reflect observed mix. Recent demand has declined from the high early-period regime; last 6 concluded demand samples (Periods 11-16 = 176,169,111,107,84,75) show a sustained lower-volatility regime\u2014use recent_N with N=6 for demand mean and volatility to focus forecasts on the current regime. These parameters will let the OR backend compute a base stock that balances the 1:1 profit/holding tradeoff while accounting for the shorter-than-promised realized lead times and recent downward demand trend.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=705. Observed concluded lead times: [2,1,1,2,1,2] \u2192 avg 1.5 (recent 3 avg 1.67). Promised L=2 but historical arrivals show consistent 1\u20132 period realizations (some shipments delayed/lost earlier but arrivals since P4 are steady). Demand has trended down from spring peaks; recent concluded demands (Periods 10\u201317) = [199,176,169,111,107,84,75,60] indicating a lower recent regime. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (lets backend use observed average). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the current lower-demand regime (N chosen = 8 = recent regime length). I also set sigma_hat recent_N with the same N to reflect recent variance. These choices down-weight earlier high spikes and align ordering with current low demand while accounting for observed shorter-than-promised lead times and the large in-transit pipeline.

A prior demand regime shift (Feb) is already recorded. To be conservative and let the OR engine use promised lead time and the full sample history, I use default lead time and default demand moments so the backend computes base_stock and cap using all available samples. This avoids overreacting to possible transient delays while the conclude messages reveal true arrival patterns.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has fallen from earlier spike; last 9 concluded demands (Periods 11-19) = [176,169,111,107,84,75,60,46,55], indicating a sustained lower-demand regime vs initial spikes. Observed concluded lead times = {Period4:2, Period6:1, Period8:1, Period10:2, Period10:1, Period14:2} \u2192 avg \u22481.5. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding, use calculated average lead time and base forecasts focused on the recent low-demand regime: set L by "calculate" (backend averages observed lead times), mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (capture the recent lower-demand regime). This reduces overstock risk while covering (1+L) periods of expected demand and accounts for observed lead-time variability.

Concluded history shows observed lead times = [2,1,1,2,1,2] (avg 1.5) \u2014 some shipments late/missing later in history but not enough sustained evidence to override observed pattern. I select L='calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time (captures mixed 1\u20132 period reality). Demand sample history is limited but no recent sustained change beyond the previously recorded shift; use default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (by acknowledging shorter-than-promised average lead time) against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1). On-hand + large in-transit suggests no urgent extra ordering signal from my side.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=705 (many past orders not yet concluded). Observed concluded lead times (from history) vary 1\u20132 periods (avg 1.5). Demand recent volatility: last 5 observed demands are [46,55,38,109,165] showing a recent uptick but variable. To be conservative about lead time variability, use calculated average lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand, focus on the most recent 5 periods to capture the recent uptick while limiting dilution from earlier high-Jan samples. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices help the OR backend set a base stock reflecting recent demand surge while acknowledging lead-time variability and avoiding over-reliance on old data; they also mitigate risk from potentially lost/concluded shipments by using recent demand evidence.

Date 2019-07-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=705. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2,1,1,2,1,2 (avg ~1.5) with intermittent lost/delayed arrivals earlier; recent demand has increased (Periods 21-23: 109,165,222) but prior carry-over already recorded a sustained regime shift in Feb\u2013Mar.

Demand forecasting and uncertainty will use the full sample set (default mu_hat and default sigma_hat) so the OR engine uses all historical demand to set base stock and cap; this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding so the backend's q=0.5 implies moderate safety stock. Using calculate/default avoids overfitting short noisy windows while letting the engine incorporate the observed lead-time variability.

Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods (mixed); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times.

Recent demand history shows elevated midsummer weekly demand (multiple 100+ weeks since Period 21). I choose to let backend infer lead time from observations (calculate) so it averages observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This balances service (higher mu when L>1) with holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory (705 units) already in pipeline; using backend defaults avoids overreacting to noisy recent spikes while respecting inferred lead time.

Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods (mixed); demand in recent weeks elevated (Periods 21\u201326: 109,165,222,164,170,242). To capture recent demand regime while letting backend infer average lead time from observed concluded arrivals, set L by calculate and use recent_N=6 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the last 6 observed demands. This balances higher recent demand against holding cost while allowing OR engine to compute base stock with updated lead-time estimate.

Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2,1,2} \u2192 average ~1.5, so use calculated average lead time to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period delivery. Recent demand (last several months) is elevated and more variable vs early history; to capture the current regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility over the last 12 samples to size replenishment for (1+L) review+lead horizon and to limit over/under-stocking given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5 implies moderate service target).

Recent demand (multiple weeks in Jul\u2013Aug) is elevated and more variable; to capture the current regime use recent_N over the last 10 demand samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds a base-stock reflecting the recent high-demand period while accounting for volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals) against holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=705 (many past orders unconfirmed recently -> possible lost/delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2,1,2} -> average ~1.5, so use calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time. Demand shifted up starting 2019-02-11 and has remained elevated; to capture the post-shift regime I use a recent_N demand estimate with N=20 (captures most recent 20 demand periods). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the recent higher-demand regime while letting the backend compute an L consistent with observed arrivals, helping balance service level vs holding cost given uncertain/delayed arrivals.

On-hand=0, in-transit=705 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals have varied historically (observed lead times 2,1,1,2,1,2 => avg ~1.5). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N=5 (last 5 demand samples: P27\u2013P31 = 294,200,175,282,286) to capture the current high-demand regime and avoid dilution by older low-demand weeks. This keeps base-stock responsive to the sustained recent demand while recognizing pipeline inventory; it balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

No new sustained demand regime change since prior carry-over insight. I choose to let the backend infer average observed lead time (method=calculate) to capture the 1\u20132 period variability. For demand mean and volatility I use default all-sample aggregates (mu_hat and sigma_hat default) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on the L it infers; with large in-transit inventory this avoids over-ordering while maintaining service given observed lead-time variability.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=861. Observed concluded lead times vary (examples: 1,2,3 periods); recent concluded evidence includes a 3-period arrival (Period 35 arrival of Period 32 order). Demand has been elevated and more variable in recent months (many weekly demands in the 170\u2013480 range). To balance service vs holding cost: infer a slightly-higher-than-promised lead time using observed history (let backend compute average from concluded lead times), and forecast demand from recent history to capture the current higher-demand regime. Use recent demand window to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service while capping orders via its cap parameter. No new carry-over patterns beyond previously recorded regime shift.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=861. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed: 1,2,3 periods); no sustained shift to a new lead-time regime (most recent single 3-period observation not yet sustained). I choose to have the OR backend infer lead time from observed history (calculate) so it uses the empirical average of concluded lead times. For demand and volatility I use defaults so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service-level vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5) and large in-transit stock already covering multiple periods of demand. This avoids overreacting to single-period anomalies while letting the engine adjust orders based on overall observed lead-time/demand statistics.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. Recent realized demand has been consistently high (many weeks with demand >150) and on-hand is 0 with 861 units in-transit. Concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed W = [2,1,1,2,1,2,3], mean \u22481.71), so I let the backend compute an average realized lead time. I choose default demand/volatility estimates (backend uses all historical samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full sample history scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use observed average L) versus holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline and uncertain but sustained elevated demand. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments\u2014calculate L will capture realized lead-time behavior from concluded arrivals.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=847. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed: 2,1,1,2,1,2,3,3) with the last two concluded arrivals having lead_time=3, suggesting a recent upward shift but not yet 3+ periods of consistent evidence. Demand has been variable recently (many weeks in the 150\u2013300 range). To balance service vs holding cost while accounting for possibly longer lead times, I set L via recent_N to capture the most recent lead-time behavior (N=3). For demand, I use recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast on the most recent 8 demand observations (captures current regime around ~150\u2013300/week). I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect recent demand volatility. This configuration raises the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window using recent observations while limiting exposure to older low-demand periods and the large in-transit position.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=847. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); recent concluded arrivals (Periods 35 and 39) show lead_time=3, prior was 2. To be conservative I set L using recent_N over the last 3 observed lead-time conclusions to capture the recent shift toward longer lead times. Demand shows no new sustained regime change since the previously recorded shift, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility. These parameters bias orders upward to cover the longer inferred lead time while relying on historical demand stats to balance service vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=847 \u2014 large pipeline but recent concluded periods show intermittent arrivals and varying lead times (observed LT samples include 1,2,3). Demand has been elevated vs early-year baseline (carry-over note recorded earlier). No clear, sustained recent change in lead time (only two 3-period observations), so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer typical LT from observed concludes. Use default demand/volatility estimation so backend uses all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use observed LT) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=0, in-transit=847 \u2014 large pipeline exists so avoid inflating forecast. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); using calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, which conservatively leverages all data and the inferred L to balance service level vs holding cost given the large in-transit stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=847 \u2014 substantial pipeline but many past shipments showed variable and sometimes delayed lead times (observed concluded lead times sequence: 2,1,1,2,1,2,3,3). No new arrivals have concluded since Period 39, so treat lead time as slightly above promised. I set L using recent observed lead times to capture the recent uptick to 3-period events. Demand is volatile recently (recent period demands: 126,119,82,289,69); use recent sample-based estimates for forecast mean and volatility to react to current regime. Choices: L -> recent_N (N=5) to capture recent lead-time average (~2.2); mu_hat -> recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)*mean on most recent demand periods; sigma_hat -> recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These settings bias the OR backend to hold slightly more safety stock vs using long-run averages, helping avoid lost-sales given observed delayed arrivals while limiting excess holding costs because N is small and reactive.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=847. Recent concluded history shows highly variable observed lead times (1\u20133 periods) and a large pipeline with no recent arrivals; to capture true lead-time variability I set L to 'calculate' (use average of observed lead times). Demand history contains multiple regimes; absent a new confirmed demand shift, use full-sample defaults for forecasting variance and mean ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend leverages all data. This choice hedges service level versus holding cost given profit=holding so the backend's q=0.5; using calculated L helps avoid under-ordering if actual lead time > promised while default mu/sigma keep estimates stable.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: in-transit=847 units but no concluded arrivals observed since Period 39 (multiple periods overdue), indicating potential lost/delayed shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=847 but no concluded arrivals since Period 39 (possible lost/delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2,1,2,3,3} \u2192 average ~1.875; I let backend calculate average lead time from observed data. Recent demand shows variability; I use the most recent 5 demand periods (Periods 41-45: 82,289,69,85,56) to capture current regime for both mean and volatility. These settings (calculate L; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5) prioritize service given large in-transit uncertainty while keeping variability localized to latest demand pattern.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, large in-transit=847 with no concluded arrivals since Period 39 \u2192 evidence of prolonged/delayed shipments. Historical conclude messages show observed lead times of 3 periods (orders placed P32->arrived P35, P36->arrived P39). Promised lead time=2 but recent confirmed lead time=3; I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed reality so the OR backend will size pipeline to cover the longer effective lead time. Demand forecast/uncertainty: use default aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed by backend over all samples with the chosen (1+L) multiplier and sqrt(1+L) scaling; this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5). This approach hedges against the delayed arrivals while avoiding ad-hoc manual scaling of demand.
