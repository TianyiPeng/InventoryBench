Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [45,45,110,34,50], mean=56.8, std\u224827.1. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so need replenishment. No 'Period X conclude' messages observed to infer actual lead time, so use promised lead time. Use default calculations: L=promised (2); mu_hat=(1+L)*mean to capture demand over review+lead; sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std to scale volatility over the same horizon. This balances service (covering 3 periods' mean demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=107 (ordered P1, not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals exist so actual lead time is unobserved; use promised/default lead time. Historical weekly mean demand = 56.8 (5 samples). With promised L=2, review+lead horizon = 3 weeks \u2192 implied demand ~170.4 units; current pipeline (107) is short of that target, so use default demand/volatility estimates to let the OR engine compute a replenishment that restores coverage while respecting caps. Methods chosen: default L to trust promised lead time until evidence; default mu_hat and sigma_hat to use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. No concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 (expected given promised L=2), so no evidence of lead-time slips or lost shipments. Historical weekly demand mean = 56.8 (5 samples from Jan\u2013Feb); (1+L)=3 gives expected coverage ~170 units. Current pipeline (in-transit=161) roughly matches that forecast. I therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, balancing service level against holding cost without overreacting to limited/no new evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical weekly demand samples (45,45,110,34,50) give mean ~56.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=161 units; two prior orders (P1=107, P2=54) have not concluded by their expected arrivals, suggesting actual lead time may be longer or shipments delayed/lost. To be conservative and avoid stockouts while shipments remain uncertain, set lead time explicitly to 3 periods (longer than promised 2). Use default demand/scatter aggregations so the OR backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat over all samples scaled by (1+L). This raises safety stock implicitly to cover expanded review+lead period while relying on historical demand; it balances service (prevent stockouts given missing arrivals) versus holding cost by not inflating demand forecast beyond historical mean.

Daily Profit: $40.00, Daily Holding Cost: $14.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $26.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent weekly demand has been ~37-49 (P1-P4), historical samples include Jan data. On-hand=14, in-transit=155; one earlier large order (P1) has not concluded and may be lost but P2 arrival confirmed lead_time=2. I use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with confirmed observation. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend leverages full historical sample set while honoring the promised lead time and current pipeline. This balances service-level (leveraging large in-transit) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand (Periods 1-5) averaged ~41.4 units/week (37,47,49,40,34) which is materially lower than the older 2019-Jan samples (mean 56.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=155 (covers multiple weeks given current demand). Period 4 conclude confirmed an observed lead time of 2 (ordered P2 arrived P4) matching the promised lead time; no sustained lead-time shifts or lost-shipment pattern yet. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (2) since observed arrival aligns and signal is not yet sustainedly different. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the clear recent lower-demand regime (use last 5 weeks to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I keep default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let the OR engine account for baseline variability. These choices keep orders conservative given large in-transit stock and prioritize avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service via recent demand-based mu_hat.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent observed demand samples (historical weeks) average 56.8 units/week with variability; last observed realized demand was 63 in Period 6 but sales were stock-constrained. On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Concluded arrivals show the Period 2 order arrived with lead_time=2 (Period 4 conclude), while the large Period 1 order (107) has not concluded and appears overdue/lost. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (observed = 2), keeping the backend's lead-time estimate aligned with confirmed evidence. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L)=3; this balances service level (covers review+lead demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and avoids overreacting to the single recent stockout that lacked confirmation of demand regime change. The chosen settings anticipate normal 2-period actual lead time, account for the current in-transit stock (155), and let the OR engine cap ordering based on its risk parameters.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4); Period 1 order (107 units) remains unarrived by Period 6 conclude and likely lost/overdue.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. Recent realized demands (Periods 4-7): 40,34,63,43 \u2014 elevated and volatile vs. historical Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=155; Period 1 order (107) remains unarrived and likely lost per prior conclude, but we observed a confirmed lead time=2 from Period 2\u21924 arrival. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent regime (weeks with higher variance) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last4) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last4); this increases safety stock to protect service given recent spikes while avoiding oversized orders given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Historical concluded lead-time evidence shows orders have arrived with 2-period lead time (Period 2\u2192arrived Period 4). Recent demand (Periods 6-8: 63,43,76) is elevated vs earlier Periods 1-5 (37,47,49,40,34). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead-times (captures confirmed 2-period behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (review+lead horizon will be (1+L)\xd7recent mean). For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect the increased variability in the recent regime. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given sustained higher demand while keeping variability-based safety stock appropriate for holding cost=profit symmetry.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 6: average demand increased from 41.4 (Periods 1-5) to 60.7 (Periods 6-8), +46.5%.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=182 (includes a likely overdue/lost Period 1 order; Period 2->4 shows actual lead time=2). Demand has shifted up starting Period 6 (periods 6-9 demand: 63,43,76,55). I keep L at the promised lead time (use default) because lead time=2 is already confirmed historically and recent arrivals are consistent. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 (last 4 demand samples) to capture the new higher-demand regime; this focuses ordering on the current elevated demand while avoiding overweighting old low-demand periods. This balances service (higher demand forecast) against holding cost given profit=holding so z* will target ~50% service level and the cap will limit extreme orders despite the higher mu_hat.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand regime increased starting Period 6 (Periods 1-5 mean=41.4; Periods 6-8 mean=60.7, +46.5%); latest observed demands (Periods 6-10) = [63,43,76,55,26]. Observed concluded lead times: Period4 shows LT=2 (P2\u2192P4), Period10 shows LT=1 (P9\u2192P10) \u2192 mixed recent evidence. Current inventory: on-hand=1, in-transit=155 (sufficient coverage). I set L="calculate" so backend averages observed lead times (uses concluded Ls) to reflect recent 1 and 2 period observations. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using the last 5 demand samples (Periods 6-10) to capture the higher post-changepoint demand and its volatility. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts under the higher regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability. The choices balance higher service (profit=holding) with elevated demand and observed LT variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). Recent demand has shifted up starting Period 6 (P6-P11 avg ~50+ vs earlier ~41). On-hand=0, in-transit=157 (includes overdue/lost older order(s) but arrivals confirmed with variable observed lead times of 2 and 1). Use observed lead times (P4 and P10 concludes) to let backend estimate average actual L. For demand, focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6-11, 6 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and volatility; this reduces stockouts while limiting excess holding given profit=holding cost parity. Methods selected: L by calculation from observed lead-time concludes; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 (the detected recent regime length) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std, balancing service level vs holding cost under the new demand regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has shifted higher since Period 6 (carry-over notes avg rose ~+46%). On-hand=0, in-transit=157 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: Period 2->4 = 2, Period 9->10 = 1 (Period 1 order likely lost). I set L using recent observed lead times (N=2) to let backend average the two confirmed leads (1 and 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 6-12) because a sustained regime shift began in Period 6 and there are 7 samples in the new regime; this yields mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent higher-demand regime so orders reflect increased demand while the in-transit buffer (157) will mitigate short-term stockouts. This balances service level (using recent higher mean) versus holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 6 (Periods 6-14 show elevated weekly demand vs Periods 1-5). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P10:1, P13:2} \u2192 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. On-hand=0, in-transit=155 (large pipeline) so use recent demand regime to size replenishment: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the most recent regime (Periods 6-14) to reflect higher mean and volatility. Chosen N=9 (regime length 9). This balances service (covering elevated demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory and some past lost/late shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Recent concluded lead times = [2,1,2] (orders in P2->P4, P9->P10, P11->P13) so average lead time ~1.67; demand has exhibited a sustained upward regime starting Period 6. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect faster-than-promised arrivals sometimes seen. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) covering Periods 6-15 to capture the higher post-changepoint mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base stock toward the new higher-demand regime while recognizing observed lead-time shortening, balancing service vs holding costs given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. History shows mixed observed lead times (arrivals: P4 from P2 => LT=2; P10 from P9 => LT=1; P13 from P11 => LT=2). Period 1 order (107) never concluded and is likely lost. Demand regime increased starting Period 6 (noted earlier); recent demand is higher and more variable. To reflect the observed lead-time variability I use recent_N (last 3 observed lead-times) for L. For demand I target the post-change regime using recent_N over the last 11 weeks (Periods 6-16) to capture the sustained higher mean and volatility, so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=11. These parameters raise the base stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the higher-demand regime while acknowledging in-transit inventory and overdue/lost shipment risk.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history shows a sustained demand lift beginning Period 6 (user carry-over): higher mean since Period 6. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2} (avg \u22481.67) so I use calculated average lead time rather than default promised to reflect mixed observations. On-hand=0, in-transit=155 (pipeline substantial) so I base demand forecast on the recent high-demand regime (Periods 6\u201317). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (regime length = 12 periods from P6\u2013P17) so the OR backend targets the elevated demand while sigma uses same window to capture current volatility. These choices balance service (by forecasting the newer higher mean) against holding cost by relying on observed pipeline and using observed lead-time average to avoid over-ordering if lead-time shorter than promised.

Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Historical concluded lead times observed = {P4:2, P10:1, P13:2} (avg ~1.67). Demand regime increased starting Period 6 (previous mean ~41.4 \u2192 recent mean ~60.7). Several overdue/lost early shipments noted (Period1 order likely lost) but recent arrivals confirm faster/variable lead times. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 6\u201318) to capture the higher post-changepoint regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the elevated demand and recent volatility; this avoids using stale low-demand history and better balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. Current in-transit (155) will be reconciled by OR engine against pipeline; these parameters encourage sufficient replenishment to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while not overstocking based on older low-demand data.

Demand regime increased beginning Period 6 (avg 41.4 \u2192 60.7); recent periods (P6\u2013P19) show sustained higher demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 6 (user-supplied insight: avg increased from 41.4 to 60.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=155 \u2014 adequate pipeline but prior early orders show occasional loss/delay (Period 1 order likely lost). Lead-time observations (arrivals concluded): 2,1,2 \u2192 mixed but centered near 2. I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=16 to capture the post-Period-6 higher-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covers Periods 6\u201321), so the base-stock reflects the new demand level and volatility while accounting for the promised 2-period cadence. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 6 (carry-over notes +46.5% regime shift). On-hand=0, in-transit=155 \u2014 pipeline is substantial but contains at least one long-overdue/lost early order (Period 1) while other concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed leads: 2,1,2). To balance service vs holding cost given observed lead-time variability, set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period behavior). Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine applies the full historical sample base while adjusting for the averaged lead time. This leverages the sizable in-transit volume and the confirmed demand uplift without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2 (P4 for P2), 1 (P10 for P9), 2 (P13 for P11) -> recent average ~1.67. Demand regime increased starting Period 6 (previously noted). To cover review+lead demand and reflect the higher recent demand, set L by averaging last 3 observed lead times (captures recent 1/2/2 variability). Use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 6 onward ~20 periods available), smoothing noise while reflecting current mean/volatility. These choices bias orders to meet elevated demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability; using recent lead-time prevents overconfidence in promised L=2 if actual Lead-time has shown occasional 1-period arrivals.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (~+46%) and mixed observed lead times (observed W={2,1,2}). On-hand=0, in-transit=155 \u2014 pipeline is substantial but one early order (Period 1) likely lost; do not assume perfect arrivals. Set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed W values). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6\u201325 capped at 20 samples) so the (1+L) demand forecast reflects the sustained higher demand while limiting noise from older low-demand samples. This balances service (higher mu_hat) versus holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Historical concludes show variable actual lead-times (observed 2,1,2) but no new sustained shift; several earlier orders appear overdue/lost but pipeline shows 155 units. Demand recently (Periods 23-27 = 43,29,48,28,51) averages ~39.8; I use a recent window to capture current demand regime. Choose L=default (promised 2) since concluded evidence is mixed and no new sustained lead-time change. Set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect the most recent demand regime ((1+L)-period aggregate based on last 5 weeks). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility and avoid over/under-stocking given equal profit and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Historical concluded lead times: observed 2,1,2 (avg ~1.67); promised=2. Demand regime shift was previously identified starting Period 6 (higher mean). To protect service under the higher recent demand while respecting observed lead-time variability, set L by averaging observed concluded lead times (backend will compute). For demand and volatility use recent_N over the most recent regime to reflect sustained higher demand; choose N=20 (regime length \u226520). This increases target base-stock to cover elevated demand while sigma based on recent variability helps the capped policy control order size and holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but prior insight confirmed LT=2; recent demand (Periods 21-29) averages lower than mid-series spike. Use promised lead time (default) to keep alignment with supplier terms and because concluded LT evidence is mixed. For demand forecast, use recent_N over the last 9 concluded demand observations (Periods 21-29) to capture the current lower-demand regime; apply same recent window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings reduce overstock risk while keeping service level for near-term demand and account for the in-transit units already en route.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (user note: mean rose from ~41.4 to ~60.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=155 (pipeline provides supply but arrivals are only visible with one-period observation delay; some prior orders were lost/overdue so we remain conservative). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2} \u2192 average ~1.67; to let backend smooth variability I use calculated average lead time. For demand I use the most recent regime (Periods 6 onward) with N=20 (regime length large) so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from the last 20 demand samples to capture the higher recent mean and volatility. This increases target base-stock to improve service given profit=holding cost, while recent_N volatility informs safety stock to avoid stockouts given occasional late/lost arrivals.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Historical concluded lead-times show mainly 2 periods with occasional 1; demand regime increased starting Period 6 (avg ~60.7 recent vs ~41.4 earlier). To reflect confirmed/observed lead-time behavior I use calculate for L (average of observed concluded lead times). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (uses most recent 20 demand samples to reflect the higher mean and recent volatility). This balances service (higher forecast covering L+1 periods of elevated demand) while letting the backend cap orders via its cap formula given limited pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Historical concluded lead times observed = {2,1,2}; demand has been elevated since Period 6 (previous insight). To be responsive to recent higher demand and variability in the last weeks, set lead time to be estimated from observed history and set demand forecast and volatility based on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the upward trend. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost by not using very long lookbacks.

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (carry-over notes) \u2014 use recent demand to capture the elevated mean/volatility. I choose recent_N with N=20 to cover the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting noise from very old low-demand samples; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias base-stock upward to protect service level given elevated demand and some overdue/lost shipments while letting the capped ordering rule limit excessive orders and holding cost exposure.

These parameters let the OR backend size base-stock for the elevated demand while capping orders via its built-in cap to limit exposure if some in-transit units are lost or delayed.

For demand, I use recent_N with N=20 (capture the post-changepoint regime from Period 6 onward, capped at 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using the most recent regime data; this balances higher service level for the new demand regime while keeping variability measured from recent samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand 0, in-transit 160. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed 1 and 2); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand shows sustained higher regime since Period 6; use recent_N on demand and volatility to focus forecast on the post-changepoint regime (use N=20 to capture recent behavior while smoothing week-to-week noise). These choices prioritize service (profit=holding, so q=0.5) while limiting excess stock by basing mu/sigma on the recent elevated demand regime and using observed average lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has been elevated vs. early samples (sustained regime shift from Period 6 onward). On-hand=0, in-transit=163 \u2014 pipeline large but some earlier orders were overdue/lost historically, so rely on recent realized demand to size replenishment. Lead time observations vary (1\u20132); use a short recent average to reflect current mix. Set L via recent observed lead-times (to capture 1\u20132 period variability). Forecast demand using the most recent sustained regime (use recent_N capped at 20 samples) so mu_hat reflects the higher post-changepoint mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=20) to capture recent variability. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated demand while avoiding excessive holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=168. Recent demand has been elevated (large spikes since Sept). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,1} \u2192 avg 1.4; use calculated average lead time to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period realizations. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime (last ~10 weeks) rather than long-run mean, so base-stock targets and safety stock respond to the recent demand spike while accounting for current pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=230. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed = [2,1,2,1,1,3]); demand regime increased starting Period 6 and has persisted. To capture current longer-run lead-time behavior while reflecting recent variability I set L using recent_N over the 6 observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N over the latest stable high-demand regime (cap at 20 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean/variance and reduce stockouts. These parameters balance service (higher mu_hat for higher demand) against holding cost by using recent regime statistics rather than full-history averages.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 6 (regime shift noted in history) with many large weekly demands through Oct/Nov (peaks up to 140). On-hand=0, in-transit=230 \u2014 pipeline substantial but some past orders were delayed/lost so use observed lead-time history to set L. Set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures variability 1\u20133 and occasional delays). For demand forecasting use recent_N with N=20 to focus on the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (20 most recent samples balances recency and sample size). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR base-stock toward meeting the sustained higher demand while using observed lead-time behavior to avoid underordering given past delays.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (previously noted) and confirmed actual lead time ~2 in concluded messages. Current inventory: on-hand=35, in-transit=163 (some early orders remain overdue/lost historically but recent arrivals align with L=2). To bias the OR engine toward the higher recent demand while limiting excess holding (profit=holding), I use recent_N demand estimates (captures the post-changepoint regime) with N=20 samples to smooth short-term volatility. Keep L at promised/default=2 so backend uses contracted lead time; compute sigma from the same recent window to reflect current variability. This balances service level (raising base stock for higher demand) against holding cost given limited on-hand stock and substantial in-transit pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=163. Historical concluded lead times (observed) show variability (1\u20133 periods); using calculated average lead time to reflect that history. Recent demand (last 8 weeks: P35\u2013P42) is elevated and more volatile versus early periods, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 8 samples to capture current regime. These parameters let the OR backend size base-stock to cover the review+lead demand under the observed lead-time distribution while reflecting higher recent mean and variance to avoid stockouts given substantial in-transit but variable arrivals.

To reflect confirmed LT=2 and recent higher-demand regime, I set L explicit=2. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (regime length >>20 so cap at 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 20 demand observations (captures the sustained higher mean/volatility). This balances service (capture increased demand) while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit overstock given sizable in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=213. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods (confirmed earlier) but occasional 1; promised L=2 remains appropriate. Demand has been elevated and volatile since Period 6 (sustained higher regime through recent months), so I use recent data to forecast demand across the review+lead period. I choose recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime while smoothing older low-demand periods. These settings bias the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts given high recent demand and the existing in-transit pipeline, while sigma_hat from recent history informs safety stock to balance holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23. On-hand=0, in-transit=163 units (pipeline sufficient to cover upcoming demand). Historical conclude messages confirm frequent actual lead_time\u22482; promised L=2. Recent realized demand elevated vs early history (last 5 concluded demands: P41-P45 = 32,72,28,46,64) \u2014 use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (2). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)-period demand from the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the December demand pattern. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend to hold more safety stock during the higher-demand December regime while respecting the promised lead time and avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand 0, in-transit 163. Historical conclude messages show variable actual lead times but prior analysis confirmed a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (higher mean). Some past orders were delayed/lost, so keep promised lead time to avoid overstating arrival reliability. Set L to default (promised = 2). Use recent demand to capture the higher recent demand: choose recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent regime while respecting caps). Apply same recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (cover higher recent demand) vs holding cost by targeting forecasts based on the current elevated regime while retaining the backend's capped order cap to limit single-period overorders. On-hand + in-transit (163) will be compared by OR engine against the computed base_stock; if in-transit already sufficient, orders will be limited by cap.
