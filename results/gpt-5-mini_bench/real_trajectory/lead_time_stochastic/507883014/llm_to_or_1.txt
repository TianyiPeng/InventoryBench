Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples: [31,60,70,64,68], mean \u224858.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals (no evidence of lead-time shifts or lost shipments). Promised lead time will be used and demand/volatility set to defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a baseline safety stock given the lack of contrary evidence.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand mean \u224858.6 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=85 (order placed Period 1) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, but promised lead time=2 so absence of arrival is expected. No sustained lead-time or demand regime change detected (need \u22653 periods of consistent evidence). Using default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean) keeps backend baseline safety stock given limited evidence and balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=167; two prior orders (P1=85, P2=82) have not concluded yet\u2014no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Demand history (weekly samples from Jan: 31,60,70,64,68) remains the best basis; include these 5 samples to capture recent season and level. Use promised lead time (default) for L to avoid prematurely assuming lost/longer lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the most relevant sample mean while accounting for (1+L) review+lead horizon. Keep sigma_hat as default (uses all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend retains full volatility information.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Historical weekly demand samples (31,60,70,64,68) mean=58.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=233. One concluded miss: Period 1 order (85) showed arrived=0 despite promised L=2, which could indicate a lost shipment or longer lead time, but evidence is limited (only one overdue conclude) so do not alter promised lead time yet. Use default methods so OR backend uses promised L=2 and full-sample demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost given limited confirmed lead-time shifts.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1178.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-11. Recent conclude shows an arrival in Period 4: 82 units ordered on Period 2 arrived in Period 4 => observed lead time = 2, matching promised. On-hand=19, in-transit=151 (some in-transit likely from prior orders). Historical demand samples (weeks in Feb) show stable weekly demand; no sustained changepoint. I therefore keep L as default (use promised lead time=2) and use default demand aggregation so OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (use three-period coverage) with low holding cost given moderate on-hand + pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period4 conclude: ordered on Period2, arrived in Period4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $361.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has risen vs. earlier Jan samples; last 3 concluded demands = [64,63,67] (avg ~64.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=196 (covers upcoming demand but arrivals are delayed by lead time). Lead time is confirmed at 2 periods from Period 4 conclude. I set L explicitly to 2 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the new higher demand regime (3-period mean -> (1+L)*mean). I use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings bias orders to satisfy (L+1) periods of the higher recent demand while keeping holding costs controlled given existing in-transit stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=155. Historical concluded lead times: one 2-period (P2\u2192P4) and one 1-period (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 mixed signals, not yet a sustained shift. Demand samples (historical weeks in snapshot) show weekly demand ~31\u201370. I choose L by "calculate" to let the backend average observed lead times (reflecting ambiguity between 1 and 2). For demand and volatility I select "default" so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), leveraging full sample set. This balances service level vs holding cost while allowing the OR engine to incorporate the inferred average lead time and all historical demand information. No evidence of lost shipments; pipeline (155) should cover upcoming periods under the averaged lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, In-transit=214. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 variability present, so set L by averaging observed lead times to let backend hedge between 1\u20132. Recent demand has been in the 50\u201367 range (last 5 concluded demands: 63,67,60,52 plus earlier 64) so use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime and volatility. These settings balance service level (using recent demand mean) against holding cost given sizable in-transit stock and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=10, in-transit=151. Historical concluded lead-times: P4 (order P2 \u2192 2), P6 (order P5 \u2192 1), P8 (order P6 \u2192 2; order P7 \u2192 1) => observed lead times = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5). Demand sample mean from provided series ~58.6/wk. Pipeline (151) substantially covers upcoming (1+L) periods of demand, so no immediate urgent ordering; use a calculated L to let backend infer the current average lead time, and default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR engine can apply its capped base-stock. This balances service level (by using observed lead-time average) versus holding cost (large pipeline reduces new order size). No evidence of sustained lost shipments beyond previously noted cases.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=199. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (observed arrivals: P2->P4=2, P5->P6=1, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1). Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand shows a modest decline (last 5 concluded demands: 67,60,52,53,28 -> mean ~52), so use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the latest regime while the backend scales by (1+L). This balances service (capture current demand level) against holding cost given uncertainty and mixed lead-time observations. No new sustained pattern beyond prior lead-time confirmation is being recorded.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent realized lead times alternate between 1 and 2 periods (observed W={2,1,2,1,1}); no clear permanent shift but average recent lead time ~1.4 so use calculated average. Recent demand has declined from ~60s to mid-40s (last 5 periods demand = [60,52,53,28,40], mean \u224846.6) \u2014 use recent_N=5 to focus forecast on this lower regime. Sigma also estimated from the same recent window to capture recent volatility. These choices keep pipeline sizing responsive to the recent lower demand while the calculated L reflects mixed observed lead times, helping the OR backend balance service level versus holding cost given profit $19 and holding $1.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=168 \u2014 large pipeline present. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods; recent sequence (Periods 4,6,8,8,10) yields an average ~1.4, so I use a recent average to capture this variability. Demand has shifted from the Jan baseline; recent demand (Periods 7-11 = 52,53,28,40,54) better represents current regime, so I use a 5-period recent mean/volatility for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Using recent_N (N=5) for all three parameters balances responsiveness to recent demand/lead-time changes while the large in-transit stock prevents aggressive ordering now. These choices help the OR backend set a base-stock that adapts to the observed shorter/variable lead times and recent demand without over-ordering given the 168 units already inbound.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=169. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,1 \u2192 avg ~1.4) and demand has been high (many periods with 50\u201370 units). To balance service and holding cost while accounting for variable lead time and the backend's use of promised L, I request the backend compute an empirical average lead time (calculate). For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L) the backend computes; this leverages full history given no sustained demand regime change and lets the OR engine produce the capped order that trades off profit vs holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=187. Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,1,2 -> avg 1.5), so I use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead times. Recent demand has risen into the 40s\u201360s; last 5 concluded demands = [28,40,54,57,65] (mean=48.8). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime and limit influence of older low-season samples. This balances service level (covering ~L+1 periods of ~49 weekly demand) against holding cost while being robust to occasional delayed arrivals.

No sustained demand regime shift detected; use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates (use full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)). This keeps OR backend aligned with observed LT=2 while avoiding overfitting to noisy short-term spikes; default mu/sigma balance service level vs holding cost given profit $19 and holding $1.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): recent demand has stepped up from ~50-70 to 65/83/140 in the last three weeks, and pipeline shows 212 units in-transit with 0 on-hand. Observed lead times in concluded history alternate 1\u20132 periods; I let the backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). To reflect the recent upward demand regime, I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures Periods 11\u201315 demands: 54,57,65,83,140) so the OR engine will scale base-stock to the higher recent mean while accounting for higher volatility. This balances higher service level needs (to avoid lost sales after large recent demands) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=341. Recent demand has risen vs early-sample baseline (recent demands: 57,65,83,140,112), suggesting a higher demand regime starting around Period 13. Promised lead time is 2 and historical concluded arrivals show a mix of 1\u20132 but no sustained shift from promised; keep L=default. To capture the recent uptick, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the 5 most recent demand samples) so the OR backend raises forecast and safety stock appropriately while respecting the promised lead time and large in-transit balance.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has spiked (Periods 13-17 demands = 65,83,140,112,62) so I use a recent-demand estimate to capture the new higher regime. On-hand=91, in-transit=220 (large pipeline) so avoid over-ordering by using inferred average lead time from observed concludes. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1] (avg \u22481.67) so I let the backend calculate the average lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 13-17) to reflect the recent spike and current volatility; this balances service level against holding cost given the already-large pipeline.

Promised lead time remains 2; no new sustained lead-time shift observed. I set L=default to keep promised lead time, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory to cover the elevated recent demand while reflecting recent variability.

No sustained shift detected, but short-term average leans slightly above 1. I set L using recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent lead-time behavior (avg of last 5 observed = 1.6) so the OR backend plans for modestly extended pipeline. Demand forecasts and uncertainty use defaults (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples) because there is no strong, sustained demand regime change in the historical samples provided. This balances service level (accounting for slightly longer recent lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has been high and variable (several weeks >80, one 140); on-hand=0, in-transit=303 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times (from arrivals) average ~1.5 periods, so I use 'calculate' to let backend set L based on observed lead-time history. Given limited clear regime shifts in demand, use default demand sizing and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies the historical demand samples adjusted for chosen L. This balances service (high recent demand) against holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

Historical demand shows a sustained upward shift since Period 15 (demands: 140,112,62,81,84,86,101) versus earlier low-January baseline (mean\u224858.6). Lead time was confirmed as 2 in prior carry-over. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 7 demand periods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stock for the current higher mean while keeping promised lead time (default). This balances higher service needs against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Several concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period realizations; to be robust I'll let the backend compute average observed lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on most recent 8 demand observations) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover the elevated demand while the large in-transit reduces new orders. Methods chosen: L=calculate to reflect observed lead times; mu_hat=recent_N,N=8 to forecast (1+L)-period demand using recent high-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N,N=8 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level for current elevated demand against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been high and variable (many weeks 60-140 in history). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=303 \u2014 sufficient pipeline but arrival timing uncertain given mixed observed lead times; past concluded evidence (Period 5) confirmed lead time = 2. I choose default lead time (use promised 2). For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited clear changepoints and sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/8/5 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=303. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1-2 periods but average \u22481.36 -> use calculated average for L. Recent demand (Periods 20-25: 86,101,93,76,73,67) appears a sustained higher regime vs the early 31-70 samples; use recent_N (last 6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current demand level and volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base stock for the (1+L)-period demand using recent demand mean/variance while using calculated L to reflect observed lead-time behavior and guard against stockouts given in-transit uncertainty.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (many weeks >50, spikes to 140), on-hand=0 but in-transit=303 units. Historical conclude messages show variable arrival timing but prior carry-over confirmed lead time=2; no sustained new lead-time signal. To be conservative and let the OR engine use full history and promised lead time, I select default for L, mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This uses all data to balance service level vs holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory and occasional missed/late arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=303. History shows volatile arrivals (some shipments delayed or lost) but prior confirmed evidence (Period 5) supports lead time=2. To avoid overfitting to recent noisy/possibly-lost arrivals, use promised/default demand & lead-time settings so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this provides a stable base-stock target while accounting for the 2-period review+lead. This balances service (using full historical mean) versus holding cost given large outstanding in-transit volume.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent concluded history shows mixed actual lead times (observed values: 2,1,2,1,1,2,2,1,1,1 \u2192 avg \u2248 1.3), and on-hand=0 with in-transit=303 units (large pipeline). Many recent periods had zero arrivals despite demand running ~57\u2013101/week, so some shipments may be delayed/lost; using observed average lead time (calculate) lets the OR engine account for faster-than-promised arrivals on average. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes demand across (1+L) review+lead period using all samples, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) without overfitting to recent volatility given possible lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02): on-hand=0, in-transit=303 which is large relative to historical weekly demand (historical samples mean \u2248 67). Observed concluded lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2 periods); average of observed lead times \u2248 1.36, so choose calculated L to let backend estimate effective lead time. With substantial pipeline present, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given high in-transit inventory and avoids overreacting to recent noise or variable arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=303 (sufficient pipeline). Recent demand (Periods 20-30) shows a higher, sustained regime vs. the Jan samples: last 11 demands avg ~74.7/week. Promised lead time remains credible (use default=2); many concluded messages show 1\u20132 but no sustained shift. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture the current elevated demand (backend multiplies by (1+L)). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to capture recent volatility. These parameters align base-stock to recent demand while relying on the large in-transit quantity to avoid stockouts and limit extra holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=303 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (mix of 1s and 2s); average across concluded arrivals suggests actual lead time \u22481.36, so use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has been lower in recent weeks versus earlier spikes; to capture the current regime I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on last 5 demand samples) so the base-stock reflects recent demand while the calculated L captures historical lead-time variability. This balances service level (using recent demand to avoid overstock) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

I choose default L (promised lead time=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full sample mean/std (scaled by 1+L).

Historical conclude messages (most recently Period 5) confirmed lead time=2 earlier; recent long gaps without arrivals could indicate lost shipments but are not yet a sustained, conclusively different lead-time regime. To avoid overreacting to missing/late arrivals (which the OR engine won't observe), use default (promised) lead time and full-sample demand moments so the backend's base-stock cap and stats remain stable while existing in-transit inventory is consumed.

No sustained change in demand regime since historical samples (mean \u224858.6). To balance service vs holding cost, use promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend computes base stock from full-sample mean and std; this avoids overreacting to recent missing-conclude noise while the sizable pipeline (303) will cover upcoming demand during lead+review periods.

No sustained demand regime shift in the last 3+ concluded periods (demands mostly in historical samples and many zeros thereafter). I select default for L to use promised lead time=2 (stable and previously confirmed), and default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full history while the large in-transit stock already mitigates stockout risk. Defaults avoid overreacting to short/noisy recent zeros and balance service level vs holding cost given substantial pipeline.

Historical concluded lead times have been noisy but previously confirmed as 2 periods; large in-transit balance suggests upcoming arrivals expected per promised lead time. To avoid overreacting to intermittent missed/concluded arrivals and because we lack a sustained recent changepoint in demand, use default/robust settings: keep L as promised (default) and let mu_hat and sigma_hat be computed from the full sample history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This prevents over-ordering against transient signals while the backend caps orders appropriately.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent realized demand has been low (~last 5 weeks: 56,37,30,35,36) and on-hand=0 with large in-transit=303. Carry-over confirmed lead time previously at Period 5. To avoid overstocking given high pipeline and low recent demand, keep L at promised (use default). Forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current low regime: mu_hat recent_N N=5. Match sigma estimation to the same recent window to capture current volatility: sigma_hat recent_N N=5. This reduces ordering driven by older high-demand samples and balances service vs holding cost given substantial in-transit units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent weekly demand samples (historical list) show typical weekly demand in the range ~30\u2013140 with many recent weeks ~30\u201380. On-hand is 0 and in-transit=303 units. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime change detected since prior insight (Lead time confirmed as 2 at Period 5). I therefore use the promised/default lead time so the backend uses L=2, and default demand/volatility estimates (backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples). This leverages full historical data while the large in-transit position (303) should cover upcoming (L+1) periods of demand; default settings avoid overreacting to noisier recent zero-arrival periods which likely reflect earlier ordering pauses rather than a persistent demand shift.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent observed demand has been in the 30\u201380/week range with no sustained regime shift; on-hand=0 and in-transit=303 which covers multiple weeks given promised lead time. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1\u20132 periods with confirmed evidence of 2 in Period 5 but variability thereafter. To be conservative and align with contract terms and OR engine assumptions, use default promised lead time and default demand statistics so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps parameters consistent with observed variability, lets the OR engine cap orders appropriately, and avoids overreacting to intermittent delays or potential lost shipments.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent visible history confirms lead time = 2 in earlier periods (carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=303 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to historical weekly demand (historical sample mean ~58.6). No sustained new demand regime or persistent lead-time shift evident in concluded messages. Use default L to keep promised lead time (2) and default demand/volatility so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from available samples; this balances service level given a large pipeline while avoiding extra holding cost from explicitly inflating forecasts.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=303. Historical concluded lead-time evidence (Period5 insight) confirms typical actual L\u22482; recent history shows arrivals consistent with 1\u20132 but no sustained shift. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. Demand historical mean (available samples) ~58.6/week; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) balances service vs holding cost. Current in-transit (303) already covers multiple (L+1) periods of demand, so no increase in forecasted demand input is needed.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent observed weekly demand has settled lower (~30\u201380) after mid-year spikes; current on-hand=0, in-transit=303 (sufficient coverage for multiple weeks). Promised lead time is 2 and earlier carry-over confirmed arrivals consistent with L=2. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. To avoid overstating demand from early-year spikes, I set mu_hat using recent_N=20 (captures the most recent ~20 weeks of realized demand behavior) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat=default to use overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices keep orders conservative given large in-transit stock and balance service level vs. holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=303. Historical demand samples (seed) mean \u224858.6; with promised L=2 the (1+L) demand \u2248176, so current pipeline (303) comfortably covers the review+lead demand. Previous confirmed lead time = 2 (carry-over). No recent conclude messages contradicting promised lead time. Use default methods so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std; this avoids overreacting to noisy recent zeros and leverages confirmed lead-time=2 while letting OR engine cap orders appropriately.

Historical concluded lead-time evidence (Period4/5) confirms lead time ~2; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change in concluded history since that insight. Pipeline (303) already covers multiple weeks; to avoid overstock given low holding cost vs profit, keep lead time and demand estimates at defaults so backend uses full-sample mean/variance. Using defaults lets OR engine compute base_stock with promised L and all-sample demand statistics while respecting the cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=303. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 2 (Period 4 conclude). Recent many periods show zero visible arrivals despite in-transit inventory which may indicate delays, but there is no sustained changepoint in demand (weekly demand fluctuates but no multi-period mean shift). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (use backend's promised lead time inference) and use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std computed from all samples. This balances service-level (using confirmed promised L) against holding costs without overreacting to possibly lost/delayed shipments.
