  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas). Apparel can see either elevated gift sales or low replenishment demand just before holiday; recent actual weekly demand for this SKU (Periods 43\u201345: 25, 14, 21) is low. Demand regime: historical high-volatility exists earlier in year, but no evidence of a new sustained demand increase in recent 4\u20136 weeks\u2014recent run is low. Lead time & pipeline: supplier lead time has been variable (1\u20133 periods historically). Current system state shows On-hand=0 but In-transit=540 units\u2014a very large pipeline relative to recent demand. Inventory economics: profit = $1/unit, holding = $1/unit/period, so carrying extra units for even one period erodes the entire unit profit; avoid creating excess on-hand inventory. Risk: some in-transit shipments may be delayed or lost, but the magnitude of in-transit (540) comfortably covers several weeks of demand even if some shipments slip. Decision: place no new order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and because pipeline sufficiently covers expected near-term demand and holiday uncertainty.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas); recent weeks (Periods 43\u201346) show low demand (25,14,21,24) so seasonally depressed now. Demand regime: earlier in year there was a sustained high-demand regime (recorded previously) but current recent data (last 4 periods) indicate low demand. Lead time / pipeline: carry-over insight already documents variable actual lead time (1\u20133 periods). Current pipeline shows 540 units in-transit. Inventory economics: Profit = $1/unit, Holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 holding one unit for a period fully erodes its gross profit, so excess inventory is costly. Decision logic: with a large in-transit quantity (540), uncertain arrival timing (1\u20133 periods), and current low demand, placing additional orders risks large holding costs with little sales upside. Therefore place no new order this period.",
