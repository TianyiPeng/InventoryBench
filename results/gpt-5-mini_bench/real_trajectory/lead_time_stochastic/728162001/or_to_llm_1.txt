Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows variable actual lead times (observed 1\u20133) and two long-overdue/lost early orders already recorded in carry-over insights; no new late arrivals in the most recent conclude (P46) so no additional lead-time change is confirmed. Inventory & demand: on-hand=155, in-transit=305 (pipeline appears large); recent realized weekly demand in Dec (P43\u2013P46) is very low (25,14,21,24) consistent with post-Christmas seasonality and much below earlier peaks. OR baseline (which effectively targets a 50% fractile because profit=holding cost) recommends 0 units; that aligns with a base-stock near the recent mean and avoids extra holding cost. Risk check: with promised L=2 we should cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand \u2014 recent 3-week demand \u2248 21\u201324/wk \u2192 ~70 units; on-hand alone (155) already covers this, and pipeline (305) provides further cushion even if some shipments are delayed. Action: place 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding cost while monitoring for any concluded evidence of lost shipments or a sustained demand uptick. Follow-up: if in subsequent concludes we see multiple expected arrivals fail to materialize beyond promised L, escalate order quantities to rebuild stock only after confirming losses. ",
