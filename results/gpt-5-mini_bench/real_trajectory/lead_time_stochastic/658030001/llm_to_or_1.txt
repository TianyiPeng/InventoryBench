Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples show values [54,53,67,78,154] with a single large spike on 2019-02-04 but not a sustained (>3 periods) regime change. Promised lead time is 2. Because the recent surge is isolated, use defaults so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples; this balances service level against holding cost without overreacting to a single spike.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=151 (order placed Period 1 not yet concluded). Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean demand \u224881.2/week with one spike (154). Promised lead time=2 periods and no concluded arrivals yet, so assume promised L. Use default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to the full sample mean and std; this balances service level (covers multi-period demand including the observed spike) against holding costs given current in-transit coverage.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded history shows orders placed in P1 (151) and P2 (187) have not yet arrived (arrived=0), so actual lead time is not yet observable; shipments may be delayed but evidence is insufficient to change promised lead time. Demand history samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04 = [54,53,67,78,154], mean=81.2) used with promised L=2. I choose default lead time (use promised L=2) because no concluded arrivals confirm a different lead time. Use default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect baseline demand over review+lead period and avoid overreacting to two recent zero arrivals. Use default sigma_hat to capture historical volatility; this balances service level (through base-stock) against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent demand samples (historical weeks) show mean ~81.2 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=400, but no concluded arrivals: orders placed in P1(151), P2(187), P3(62) all show arrived=0 in their conclude messages, indicating shipments are overdue or lead time is longer than promised. Promised L=2 but sustained non-arrivals for three consecutive periods justify treating lead time as longer this period. I set L explicit=3 to reflect likely extended lead time so the OR backend will plan for a 4-period demand coverage (1+L). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)=4, balancing service level against holding cost given uncertain arrivals and current large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time likely >2 periods: orders placed P1(151), P2(187), P3(62) all arrived=0 by their conclude messages (three consecutive periods of non-arrival).

Daily Reward (R_t): $393.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). On-hand=71, in-transit=318. Historical demand samples mean=81.2 (5 samples). Recent conclude shows order placed P2 arrived in P4 => observed lead_time=2. Use L method 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed 2-period lead time while allowing future updates). Use mu_hat 'default' => (1+L)*mean of all samples to scale demand over review+lead period. Use sigma_hat 'default' to scale demand volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (profit=$4) vs holding cost ($1) while accounting for observed arrivals and remaining in-transit pipeline; missing arrivals from other orders will be treated by the OR engine via the calculated lead time average.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order placed on Period 2 arrived on Period 4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $284.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and no new sustained lead-time shifts. On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (outstanding earlier orders). Recent demand has declined (last 3 concluded demands: P3=91, P4=116, P5=85; mean\u224897.3). To keep pipeline covering review+lead period while reacting to the recent lower demand regime, use promised/default lead time and base demand on the most recent 3 periods ((1+L)=3 coverage). Use the same recent-3 window for volatility to reflect current variability. This reduces overstock risk given the large in-transit volume and lower recent demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=318. Recent demand (Periods 1-6) shows consistently higher weekly demand (177,162,91,116,85,102) vs. earlier historical samples (Jan values mean=81.2). Concluded lead-time evidence: order placed P2 arrived P4 (lead_time=2). Given sustained elevated demand over 6 periods, I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new regime. L: use calculate (average of observed lead times = 2) to reflect confirmed LT evidence. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=6 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 6 demand observations, capturing the upward regime. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters ensure the OR backend targets service with current higher demand while keeping holding exposure tied to recent variance; using calculate for L encodes the confirmed lead time rather than the promised default.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from earlier Jan baseline (mean=81.2) to recent periods (Periods 1-6 mean=122.2, +50%), sustained across 6 weeks

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has shifted higher and been sustained (Periods 1\u20136 average ~122). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 \u2014 pipeline coverage is substantial but arrivals are only visible next period. Lead-time evidence: concluded history shows at least one confirmed lead time = 2 (order P2 arrived in P4) and earlier no-arrivals consistent with transient delays; use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. Set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the most recent 6 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These parameters bias stocking toward the confirmed higher demand while the OR backend cap prevents extreme over-ordering given sizable in-transit inventory, balancing service level (profit $4) against holding cost ($1).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has shifted up (sustained higher mean over recent 6 weeks); current on-hand=0, in-transit=318 (pipeline large). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P7->P8) -> variable; use averaged lead time to let OR backend smooth variability. Set L=calculate to use observed lead-time average. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to capture the confirmed higher recent demand regime (6-week evidence). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward servicing the higher recent demand while letting the OR engine account for lead-time via its calculation.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand elevated vs early-Jan baseline; last 6 observed period demands (P4-P9) average ~99.8 with volatility from ~85\u2013116. On-hand=0, in-transit=321 (covers several future arrivals but past orders showed late/non-arrival patterns). Observed concluded lead times: P2->P4 = 2, P7->P8 = 1 (mixed evidence). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 1 and 2 period observations). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (use last 6 periods to capture the new, higher-demand regime). For volatility I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent variability. These settings bias orders toward the recent higher demand while letting the OR engine incorporate estimated lead time and cap; using recent data mitigates overreaction to older low-Jan samples and helps cover (L+1) periods of demand given in-transit uncertainty.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (covers multiple future periods). Recent observed lead times (concluded) = {P4:2, P8:1, P10:1} \u2014 recent average shorter than promised, so use recent observed average. Demand history shows a higher baseline earlier but recent 6-week behaviour is more representative; use recent 6 samples for demand mean/volatility to capture current regime. These choices (L recent_N=3, mu_hat recent_N=6, sigma_hat recent_N=6) let the OR engine size base stock to current realized lead-time and recent demand while avoiding overreacting to early high peaks; large in-transit reduces immediate urgency to order.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand history shows a higher-demand regime in early periods (Periods 1\u20136 mean ~122) but demand has softened the last few weeks. On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (large pipeline). Concluded arrivals imply observed lead times of 2,1,1 \u2192 use an averaged lead time estimate to reflect realized variability. Use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to bias forecast toward recent weeks while retaining some history. Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to recent demand spikes while the large in-transit inventory tempers additional ordering to control holding cost.

Demand has shown a sustained upward shift in recent weeks; use recent-demand window to capture the higher regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has shifted down from the earlier high-Jan baseline: last 6 observed weekly demands (Periods 9-14) = [85,60,44,100,71,54], mean=69.0, lower and less volatile than the earlier 6-week regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=318 (sufficient pipeline cover for multiple weeks). Observed concluded lead times = [2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P7\u2192P8), 1 (P9\u2192P10)] \u2014 recent behavior suggests a shorter realized lead time than earlier anomalies. I set L using recent observed lead times to reflect current realized timing (recent_N, N=3). For demand I use the most recent 6 samples (recent_N, N=6) to capture the downward regime and avoid overordering against earlier high demand. Sigma is estimated from the same recent window to match current variability. These choices reduce service-level overshoot from older high-demand periods while respecting current pipeline (318 units) and the backend capped ordering rule, balancing profit-driven service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=318. Historical concludes show mixed lead times (observed W={2,1,1}); demand has a sustained higher regime (recent mean ~122 over past ~6 weeks). To capture the observed variability in arrivals I let the backend compute an average observed lead time (method=calculate). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Sigma will also use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance higher service level from the elevated demand forecast while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability and observed lead-time behavior.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times: P4 shows order on P2 lead_time=2; P8 shows P7\u21921; P10 shows P9\u21921 \u2014 average observed lead time \u22481.33, so I use calculated average to capture realized variability vs promised 2. Demand history shows an earlier sustained uplift (Periods 1\u20136 mean=122.2) but more recent weeks are lower; without clear new sustained shift, use default demand aggregation to let OR backend combine all samples. Using calculate for L lets the backend set lead time to observed average; default mu_hat and sigma_hat use all samples scaled by (1+L), providing a conservative forecast that balances service level and holding cost given current in-transit=318 and on-hand=0.

Recent concluded lead times observed = {2 (P2->P4),1 (P7->P8),1 (P9->P10)} \u2192 recent average \u22481.33; demand in last 6 periods (P12\u2013P17) = [100,71,54,91,62,43], recent mean \u224870.17. To avoid over-ordering given big in-transit pipeline and recent lower weekly demand, I set lead time based on the last 3 observed lead times and demand/volatility based on the most recent 6 demand samples so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and uses recent volatility for safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=0, in-transit=328. Historical concluded lead-time observations show mixed 1\u20132 periods (observed W={2,1,1}); I choose to let backend compute average observed lead time to reflect this evidence (method=calculate). Demand has shifted higher and sustained over recent weeks (carry-over insight notes a +50% shift across 6 weeks), so I use recent demand statistics to capture the new regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 demand samples (recent_N N=6). This preserves responsiveness to the elevated mean/volatility while relying on observed lead-time average to handle intermittent arrival timing; the OR backend will convert these into a base-stock level balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=328. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed = 2,1,1); many earlier orders showed non-arrival but some later arrivals confirm shorter lead times at times. Recent demand has dropped vs earlier spike. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (captures observed variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the new lower regime (Periods 13-19) rather than the older high-demand weeks; this reduces overstocking risk given large in-transit volume. Sigma set to recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep expected pipeline aligned to recent demand, avoid excess holding given holding cost $1 and modest profit $4, and account for lead-time variability by letting backend compute mean lead time from observed conclusions.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20: recent avg demand (Periods 13-19) = 59.1 vs prior recent baseline 122.2 (-51.5%), sustained 7 periods

Recent history shows a sustained demand downshift (Periods 13-19 avg=59.1 vs prior 122.2) so use recent demand stats; observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1} so use calculated average lead time. Choose L=calculate to reflect measured lead-time mean (backend will compute ~1.33). Use mu_hat recent_N N=7 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (Periods 13-19) so (1+L)*mean reflects current lower demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This balances service (use recent lower demand) vs holding cost given large in-transit inventory and confirmed demand drop.

On-hand=0, in-transit=328 which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at the recent demand rate. Historical concluded lead-times show no new sustained shift since prior confirmation; keep promised lead time. Therefore set L=default. Use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent 10 weeks (Periods 13\u201322) to capture the sustained low-demand regime (N=10). Match sigma to the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This keeps base stock modest (reducing holding cost) while the large in-transit volume preserves service level.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 20 (recent avg ~59.1, more recent weeks even lower), so forecast should use the post-change samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=328 (large pipeline) so avoid inflating target; some past orders showed delayed/non-arrival patterns but conclude history shows observed lead times of 2,1,1 \u2014 use measured average lead time. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect realized arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent demand regime (recent_N with N=7 covering the sustained low-demand window used in the changepoint detection) so the OR engine targets a lower base stock and limits orders given high pipeline and holding cost. This balances service vs holding given profit=$4, holding=$1.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 20 (avg ~59.1 for P13-19 and continued low across P20-25), so I will forecast using recent low-demand samples. On-hand=0 but in-transit=328 (these may include delayed/lost earlier orders); concluded lead-time observations are limited but show recent arrivals with lead times {2,1,1} \u2014 I use a short recent average to reflect observed variability rather than the promised fixed value. Choose L by averaging the last 3 observed lead times (captures the 2 and two 1s). Use recent demand (most recent 13 periods covering the current low-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes orders to the new lower demand and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service. These settings balance service level (by using recent variability) against holding cost given the sustained downward demand shift and existing in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has shifted down from earlier Jan/Mar spikes \u2014 the last 14 weeks (Periods 13\u201326) average ~47.5 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=328 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P8:1, P10:1} (last 3 observed LT values), so I use recent_N (N=3) for L to reflect shorter observed LT average while remaining robust to sporadic delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=14) to anchor mu_hat to the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 13\u201326). Sigma also uses recent_N (N=14) to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target stock aligned to the current low-demand regime while acknowledging the substantial in-transit volume and observed shorter lead times.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=328 (sufficient pipeline but not yet visible due to observation delay). Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (confirmed L=2 in earlier window, occasional 1-period arrivals), but promised lead time remains 2. Demand regime change previously detected at Period 20 (sustained lower demand since P13-19 avg=59.1 vs prior 122.2). I set L to default (promised 2) because concluded lead-time evidence is mixed and OR backend expects promised L. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (regime since Period 20 spans 8 periods through current history) so mu_hat reflects the post-Period-20 lower regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N to capture recent variability. These choices reduce overstock risk given lower sustained demand while keeping enough pipeline to cover lead+review periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=328. Concluded lead-time observations show recent arrivals with lead times [2,1,1] \u2192 recent average ~1.33; several earlier periods had long non-arrivals but concluded data supports shorter recent lead times. Demand has spiked in the last 3 weeks (Periods 26-28 = 100,166,133) compared with the recent low baseline (~59.1). I set L using a recent_N average of the last 3 observed lead times to adapt to the shorter recent lead-time behavior. For demand (mu_hat) and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (use the last 3 weeks), so the OR backend will raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma reflects recent volatility. This balances higher service level (profitably selling at $4/unit) against holding cost $1/unit by reacting to an established short-run demand increase.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: recent avg (Periods 26-28)=133 vs prior baseline 59.1 (+125%), sustained 3 periods

Lead-time observations (arrivals concluded: P2\u2192P4 W=2, P7\u2192P8 W=1, P9\u2192P10 W=1) imply average lead time \u22481.33; use calculated average.

Observed concluded lead times include 2,1,1 (mixed; use average across observed to let backend infer typical lead time). Recent demand has shifted up sharply since Period 26 (high weeks: Periods 26-30 = [100,166,133,105,167]); to protect service during this high-demand regime, forecast demand using the most recent 5 samples. Set L via 'calculate' (average of observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new high-demand regime and recent volatility; this balances higher service needs against holding cost given existing large in-transit inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has risen and been volatile: last 7 observed weekly demands (Periods 26-32) are high (100,166,133,105,167,178,138) so I forecast using that recent regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=472 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals have shown mixed lead times. Concluded lead-time observations show the last three concluded arrivals had lead_time=1 (orders from P7->P8, P9->P10, P31->P32), so I set L by averaging the most recent 3 observed lead times (recent_N N=3 \u2192 L\u22481). To capture the elevated recent demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 demand samples (recent_N N=7) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the current high-demand regime. This balances higher service needs against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has accelerated sharply since Period 29 (recent demands P29-33 = 105,167,178,138,213). On-hand=0, in-transit=472 (pipeline large but some prior orders were lost/delayed historically). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P8:1, P10:1, P32:1} -> avg \u22481.25. To capture the now-higher demand regime while remaining conservative on lead time uncertainty, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will average). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to make the forecast and volatility responsive to the latest 5 periods (P29-33) where demand has risen; this helps the OR engine size orders for the current elevated demand while limiting excess inventory given holding cost. This approach balances higher service needs against holding cost and accounts for past lost/delayed shipments by using observed lead-time calculation rather than blind promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: recent avg demand (Periods 30-33)=174.0 vs prior baseline 59.1 (+193%), sustained 4 periods

Observed concluded lead times vary (observed W = 2,1,1,1,3 \u2192 avg 1.6), so I let the backend calculate an average lead time from observed data. On-hand=0, in-transit=525 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists, so using a recent-demand estimate avoids underordering if high demand persists while the backend caps order size appropriately. Chosen methods balance service (capture recent high mean) vs holding cost (rely on pipeline and backend cap).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,1,3,1} (avg 1.5) so use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead times. Recent demand regime change detected around Period 34 (recent high demand window length=4); to capture this spike I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 4 samples) so the OR engine targets higher base stock while reflecting recent volatility. No new evidence of lost shipments beyond historical variability; this balances higher service level for the recent spike against holding cost.

Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=517. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,1,3,1} \u2192 average 1.5; lead time has varied so use the observed average. Demand has shifted to a sustained high regime since late Period 29; using recent 9 weeks (Periods 29\u201337) captures the current mean demand (~128.7 units/week) and volatility (std ~49.6). With (1+L)\u22482.5 this implies a review+lead demand forecast \u2248322 units and appropriately larger safety stock; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service level against holding cost given the recent high-demand regime and variable lead times.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=517 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,3,1} (avg ~1.6) with recent variability including a 3-period outlier. To capture actual observed mean lead time use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand has been nonstationary with recent high weekly demand (Periods 33-38 = 213,123,91,70,73,74); I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the latest regime and avoid diluting with older low-demand weeks. This keeps base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N reflects current volatility. Large in-transit inventory will cap orders via OR engine cap.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=517. Recent demand has been volatile with a moderate recent average; multiple past lead-time observations (1,1,2,3,1) suggest actual lead time differs from promised. To balance high service target (profit $4 vs holding $1) while reacting to recent regime shifts, I set L by calculating the average observed lead times (captures empirical lead-time mix). For demand I use recent_N based on the most recent data window (N=7 weeks, captures current demand level around ~101 units/week) and match sigma_hat to the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices give the OR backend a short, data-driven lead-time estimate and a demand forecast focused on the latest regime, reducing stockouts from underestimated demand while limiting excess holding from older high-demand periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=517. Recent demand has moderated from earlier spikes; last 7 observed demands (Periods 34-40) average ~83 units/week. Pipeline (517) is large relative to recent weekly demand, so avoid inflating targets. Use observed lead-time averaging to let backend smooth variability. Choose recent 7-sample demand window to reflect current regime and match volatility estimate to same window so service-level sizing responds to recent demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has fallen vs earlier spikes: last 5 demands (Periods 37-41) = [73,74,67,66,44], avg ~64. On-hand=0, in-transit=517 (large pipeline; some prior orders experienced delays/losses historically). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,1,1,3,1] \u2192 mixed; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (minimizes overstating mu and reduces holding cost given high pipeline). Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders down vs long-run mean to avoid excess ending inventory while respecting the observed lead-time behavior.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=517. Historical concluded lead times are inconsistent (observed W = [2,1,1,1,3,1], mean=1.5) so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand (Periods 36-42) is lower than earlier spikes (seven-week recent mean ~64 vs prior higher regimes); to reflect this regime I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility. This balances service (use measured lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory: using recent demand reduces new ordering compared with whole-sample mean.

Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=517. Recent concluded lead-time observations = {2,1,1,1,3,1} (avg 1.5) so use calculated average lead time to capture variable deliveries. Demand has shifted down since Period 34; I use recent_N (N=7, Periods 37-43) where avg demand \u224855.6 to forecast the (1+L) review+lead demand and volatility\u2014N=7 chosen because a sustained lower-demand regime persisted 7 periods. These settings reduce overstock risk given large in-transit and lower recent demand while still covering short lead-time uncertainty.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=517 (large pipeline). Observed lead times vary (1\u20133) with recent sample average ~1.5; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 34\u201344) has declined from earlier peaks; to capture the recent lower demand I set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 11 weeks (Periods 34\u201344). Variability will use default (all-sample std scaled) so the OR engine retains broader uncertainty. These choices bias orders toward the current lower-demand regime while acknowledging mixed lead-time evidence and the sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent weekly demand is low (Periods 39-45 avg \u224840 units/week) and we're near year-end/holiday lull. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=517 units (likely sufficient for upcoming weeks); avoid additional overstock. Use promised lead time (default L=2) because recent concluded messages include confirmation of 2-period arrivals and no new sustained lead-time change. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=7) to capture the current low-demand regime (Periods 39-45). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce ordering given large pipeline, aligning service vs holding cost tradeoff.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 20 (sustained drop); Dec weeks show low weekly demand (Periods 43-46: 17,27,15,16). On-hand=0, in-transit=517 (large pipeline) \u2014 no recent conclude showing new arrivals, so cannot confirm lead-time shifts now. Choose L=default (use promised 2). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime since Period 20 while capping N at 20; sigma_hat also recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias the OR backend toward lower base-stock appropriate for the prolonged lower-demand regime while leaving lead time at the promised value because no new arrival evidence contradicts it.
