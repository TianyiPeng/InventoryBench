Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show no sustained regime change (5 samples, mean ~65.8, moderate variance). No concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding overfitting to short history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=98 (ordered P1). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unknown; promised L=2 used. Historical weekly demand mean=65.8 (samples: 73,48,65,94,49). With L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 periods so baseline demand forecast = 3\xd7mean. In-transit (98) is well below the 3-period demand estimate, so parameters use default population estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change yet.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=192 (orders from P1=98 and P2=94). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer a lead-time change; both prior orders still plausibly in-transit to arrive this period. Historical weekly demand samples = [73,48,65,94,49], mean \u224865.8, std \u224817.0. I use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, ensuring ordering targets cover current+L future periods while the capped policy limits order size given pipeline. This balances service level against holding cost given limited on-hand and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand mean = 65.8 (samples: 73,48,65,94,49). Three consecutive conclude messages show zero arrivals for earlier orders (P1 ordered=98, P2 ordered=94, P3 ordered=40 all concluded with arrived=0) \u2014 sustained delivery delay. I therefore set lead time explicitly longer than promised to reflect observed delays (L=3). Using L=3, I set mu_hat explicitly to (1+L)*mean = 4*65.8 = 263.2 to cover the review+lead period demand. I keep sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses sqrt(1+L)*std to size safety stock; this balances higher service level given delayed arrivals vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Observed sustained delivery delays: orders in Periods 1\u20133 concluded with arrived=0 (e.g., P1 ordered=98 did not arrive by P3), indicating lead time > promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $286.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=18, in-transit=199; recent concludes show one confirmed lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4) but earlier P1 shipment never arrived by P3 (sustained delays/lost risk). To be conservative on lead time estimate use observed lead times average. Demand history mean\u224865.8/wk; use default demand scaling so backend computes (1+L)*mean and variance from all samples. These settings let the OR engine raise base-stock to cover review+lead demand while backend cap prevents excessive single-period receipts; using observed lead time average helps account for delivery delays without overcommitting explicit extra inventory.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent history shows very high demand (samples mean 65.8/wk) and evidence of delivery disruptions: P1\u2013P3 orders did not fully conclude and only the P2 order concluded with lead_time=2. On-hand=0, in-transit=220 (some earlier orders may be delayed or lost). I select L by 'calculate' to let the backend use observed lead times (captures the confirmed P2 lead_time=2 while allowing averaging if more concludes arrive). For demand I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples), preserving historical weekly mean scaled for review+lead period. For sigma_hat I use 'default' to reflect historical volatility across the full sample set. These choices balance service (accounting for observed lead time) against holding cost by relying on full-sample estimates rather than overreacting to potentially noisy recent arrivals or missing shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent realized weekly demand has been high and stable (periods 1-6 demands: 63,88,84,76,85,82) \u2014 using recent data rather than the older 2019 samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=220 (pipeline sizable but some prior orders were delayed/missing). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6) \u2014 mixed but recent evidence limited, so use a short recent average. Chosen L as recent_N (N=2) to reflect the most recent observed lead times. Chosen mu_hat and sigma_hat as recent_N with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (use last 6 observed demands) so the OR backend builds a base-stock sized for current demand; sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost while acknowledging some in-transit inventory and past delays.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded arrivals show inconsistent lead times (observed 2 and 1 periods) and several earlier missing arrivals; pipeline=253, on-hand=0 so significant supply is already en route. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (reflects mixed 1\u20132 period evidence) rather than the promised value. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the engine uses the full-sample mean/STD scaled by (1+L) \u2014 this balances service level given high pipeline and avoids overreacting to noisy/partial arrivals or single-period spikes.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=199, profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical concluded lead times from arrivals: P2->P4 = 2, P5->P6 = 1, P6->P8 = 2, P7->P8 = 1 (avg 1.5). Demand history (most recent 5 periods P4-P8): 76,85,82,54,94 indicating a recent mean ~78.2. To reflect observed variable lead time use calculate (backend average of observed lead times). For demand forecast use recent_N N=5 to focus on the latest regime. For volatility use recent_N N=5 to capture recent demand variability. These choices hedge against the mixed lead-time evidence and prioritize recent demand patterns to balance service level and holding cost given limited on-hand and sizable in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Observed actual lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods (P2->P4=2, P5->P6=1, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1); average observed lead time = 1.5.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (2,1,2,1) \u2192 average \u22481.5; several early orders (P1\u2013P3) were missing for multiple periods but later arrivals confirm variable lead time rather than total loss. On-hand=0, in-transit=257 which is large and likely covers multiple periods of demand; nevertheless lead time volatility requires using recent demand to capture current regime. I set L via 'calculate' (use observed lead times average). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent 5 realized weekly demands (Periods 5\u20139) which capture the current higher/volatile demand pattern; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward current demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and avoiding overreliance on older samples.

To capture this shift from the promised L=2, set L using recent_N over the last 5 observed lead times.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=235 (large pipeline but previous periods show intermittent arrivals and some lost/delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods (P2->P4=2, P5->P6=1, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1, P9->P10=1) \u2014 use a recent average to capture this variability. Demand recently is elevated and variable (most recent concluded demands: P8\u2013P12 = 94,57,51,63,68) so use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to reflect current regime. These settings let the OR backend estimate an empirical lead time (mitigating lost/delayed shipments) and size the base stock from recent demand and volatility to balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding excess holding costs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times of 1\u20132 periods (observed: P2->P4=2, P5->P6=1, P6->P8=2, P7->P8=1, P9->P10=1, P11->P13=2) \u2014 recent average ~1.5. I set L using recent observed lead times (N=6) to reflect this shorter/variable actual lead time vs the promised 2. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default historical-calculation so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across samples; this keeps forecasts grounded in full-sample demand while the adjusted L accounts for realized faster deliveries and missing shipments, balancing service level and holding cost given current large in-transit stock.

To capture the realized variability I let the backend compute average observed lead time (method=calculate).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=232. Historical concluded lead times show variability between 1 and 2 periods (several 1s and 2s; recent average ~1.5) so I let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed conclusions. Demand shows no clear sustained regime shift beyond the provided historical samples, so use full-sample defaults for demand mean/volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while letting the OR engine trade service-level (profit $4 vs holding $1) via its q-based z*. The large in-transit balance (232) plus using calculated L avoids over-ordering if lead time shortens; default mu/sigma avoid overreacting to recent noisy weeks.

Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=232. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods (recent average ~1.5). To capture this persistent mixed lead-time regime I set L explicit=1.5 so the OR engine sizes pipeline for the observed effective delay. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (conservative use of full history). This balances service (accounting for longer/variable lead time) vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Historical concluded lead times show variability with recent observed values [2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2] (avg\u22481.625) and multiple late arrivals\u2014so I use a recent-average lead time to reflect current mix. Demand has been volatile but recent weeks (last 8 periods) better represent current regime, so I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=8). These choices raise the target pipeline to cover the slightly-above-1.5 observed lead time while using recent demand stats to balance service level vs holding costs given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=228. Historical arrivals show mixed lead times (1\u20132) with recent arrivals dominated by 2-period deliveries; recent demand (Periods 16\u201320) has softened (demands = 46,67,58,47,30; mean\u224849.6). To be conservative versus delayed shipments we estimate lead time from the most recent observed lead-time samples. Set L using recent_N to capture the latest delivery pattern (N=4). For demand, use recent_N over the last 5 demand periods to reflect the current lower regime (N=5). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock tied to the current lower demand while acknowledging slightly longer effective lead time, reducing stockout risk given substantial in-transit inventory and past delivery variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time trending toward 2 periods: last 4 observed lead times avg=1.75 (recent observed lts: 2,2,2,1), indicating recent deliveries are more often 2 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=228. Recent conclude history shows most observed lead times at 2 periods (last 4 observed LTs avg=1.75) and several earlier delayed/lost arrivals\u2014so assume actual LT = 2 to avoid under-ordering. Use L explicit=2 to reflect confirmed recent trend. Demand history (seed samples mean=65.8) will be scaled by (1+L)=3 by default forecasting; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes base-stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full sample set, providing a conservative replenishment given uncertain deliveries and high stockout risk. This balances service (avoid stockouts) versus holding cost by relying on observed higher lead time and the historical demand mean/variance.

To reflect the recent delivery regime I set L to the recent_N average of the last 4 observed lead times (captures the shift toward 2). mu_hat and sigma_hat use default methods so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service (higher L raises required coverage) against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Recent concluded lead times lean toward 2 periods (recent avg ~1.75) and deliveries have been inconsistent; to be conservative I set L=2 (explicit). Demand recently stabilized at lower weekly levels (last 5 demands: Periods 19\u201323 = 47,30,39,50,33) so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime. This keeps forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean aligned to observed demand while sigma based on recent volatility; using recent data avoids inflating inventory from older higher-demand samples and leverages the large in-transit stock to limit new orders and holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-07-29 (P25). On-hand=0, in-transit=228. Recent concluded arrivals show lead times clustering at 2 (recent observed lts: 2,2,2,1), so I use a recent average for lead time. Recent demand has been lower than the historical sample (recent 5-period avg \u2248 37.8 vs historical mean \u224865.8), so I forecast using the most recent 5 periods to capture the downward regime. Using recent_N for sigma to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a base stock aligned to recent lower demand and the inferred slightly-higher lead time, while the large in-transit pipeline will reduce aggressive ordering risk.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=228. Historical concluded lead times show recent tendency toward 2 periods (recent observed LTs: 2,2,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.75). Recent demand (Periods 20\u201325 = 30,39,50,33,37,33) average \u2248 37 units/week. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 q=0.8, high service target) I set lead time using a recent-average to reflect recent delivery behavior, and forecast demand using recent samples to capture the lower current regime. I choose L recent_N N=4 to weight the four most recent observed lead times, mu_hat recent_N N=6 to use the six most recent weekly demands (multiplied by 1+L by backend), and sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This keeps orders responsive to the lower recent demand while recognizing the slightly-elevated effective lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=228 (large pipeline but recent history shows variable lead times and many lost/delayed arrivals). Observed concluded lead times show recent trend toward ~1.75 periods (last 4 observed lts: 2,2,2,1). Demand has been muted since Period 5 (~30\u201370/week) \u2014 recent regime spans many periods. To balance service vs holding cost: use a recent average lead time (captures deliveries \u2260 promised), and recent demand estimates (use last 20 weeks to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime), and recent volatility over same window so safety stock reflects current variability.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=228; recent concluded history shows lead times around 1\u20132 but trending to 2 and many delayed/non-concluded shipments, so use explicit L=2 (promised/confirmed recent mode). Demand in recent periods (P23\u2013P27 = 33,37,33,44,68) appears the most relevant regime; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility. This sets forecast over (1+L) periods using immediate recent demand pattern while acknowledging delayed arrivals in rationale so the OR backend will target service with modest safety stock without overweighting stale earlier high-demand weeks.

On-hand 0, in-transit 228; many concluded periods show no recent arrivals, but historical concluded lead-time evidence (Periods up to 21) shows recent observed lead times trending ~2. To reflect recent delivery behavior I set L by averaging the last 4 observed lead times (recent_N N=4). Demand samples are sparse and distorted by stockouts; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a conservative base-stock while the L adjustment increases pipeline cover to reduce stockouts given delayed arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead-times (observed) are mixed but average below promised 2; recent evidence (Periods up to 21) trended toward ~2 but not definitively higher. Large in-transit balance suggests outstanding shipments may still arrive or be delayed/lost; to be conservative I let the OR engine infer lead time from observed history (calculate) and use default demand statistics so backend applies (1+L) scaling consistently. This balances service (using observed LT) versus holding cost given zero on-hand and substantial pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=228 (many prior shipments delayed or missing). Recent concluded lead times show variability but the last observed sequence (noted in carry-over) averages ~1.75; I will use a short recent average to capture this. Demand seed samples (early 2019 weekly data) show mean ~65.8; to cover review+lead period I use recent_N on those 5 baseline samples. Methods chosen: L recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent observed lead-time mix; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to base forecast on the provided historical weekly demand samples (uses (1+L)*mean of last 5); sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to compute volatility from same recent demand sample window. These choices balance service (capture longer recent lead-times) against holding cost by using a concise recent sample for demand and volatility rather than all zeroed stockout periods.

LLM Rationale:

Many past periods showed delayed/lost arrivals but recent carry-over indicates lead time trending to 2. I use promised lead time (default) to keep OR backend aligned with contract L=2. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std) so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set; this balances service (higher base stock via 1+L multiplier) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory already present.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23): on-hand=0, in-transit=228. Historical concludes show variable lead times but recent deliveries trend toward 2 periods; many earlier prolonged delays/lost shipments. To reflect recent lead-time behavior I use recent_N for L (average of last 4 observed lead times per recorded concludes). Demand has increased in recent weeks (last 5 period demands = 49,46,95,101,65; mean ~71.2) so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime. These settings (L from recent observed LT, mu_hat/sigma_hat from recent demand) help the OR backend set a base-stock that covers the review+lead window while keeping service-level aligned to profit/holding tradeoff and avoiding overreliance on old low-demand samples. I note in-transit=228 may already cover multiple periods of demand; backend will cap orders accordingly.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=251. Recent observed lead times have trended toward 2 periods; many earlier deliveries were delayed or lost. Recent realized demand (periods 30-33) is elevated: [95,101,65,114], suggesting a new higher-demand regime. I set L explicit=2 to reflect the persistent trend toward 2-period deliveries and to avoid underordering given prior delays. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current high-demand regime (backend will compute mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of last 4 demands). For volatility I use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent variability. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand and existing pipeline shortfall) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=312. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times but trending ~2 (last 4 observed lts avg=1.75). Recent demand has risen (periods 30-34: 95,101,65,114,82). To avoid stockouts while respecting higher recent demand and lingering transit, set L by recent observed lead times (capture 1.75 trend) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 demand samples to reflect the uptick. Methods chosen: L=recent_N (N=4) to let backend average last 4 observed lead times; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to weight the recent higher-demand regime and its volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Recent concluded lead times show variability with a rising mean (multiple 2s and one 3), so I use the observed average lead time rather than the promised value to let the OR engine size orders for the current effective pipeline. Demand history shows no clear new regime shift; use default demand stats (all samples) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding costs given the large in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=0, in-transit=289. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with recent evidence of delays (notably a 3-period arrival P33->P36). To be conservative and restore service, I set lead time L explicitly to 2 (matches promised and recent trend toward 2). Demand history (provided samples) is limited; I use default demand sizing so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances higher reorder to cover the (L+1) demand window while letting the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=289. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence includes 2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,3) with recent trend toward longer delays; the last 5 observed lead times average 2. To be conservative vs. late arrivals I set L using recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine plans for a 2-period effective lead. Demand samples (provided historical 5-week series, mean\u224865.8) are used by default scaling: mu_hat default uses (1+L)\xd7mean to cover review+lead demand. Sigma_hat default used (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to reflect sample volatility. These choices increase safety stock vs. persistent delivery delays while avoiding explicit manual inflation of demand volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent concluded deliveries show lead times clustered around 2 (recent observed LTs: 2,2,2,3 with average 2.25) and historically variable; on-hand=0, in-transit=289 so sizable pipeline exists. I choose to estimate L from the most recent observed lead times to capture the trend toward multi-period deliveries while letting the OR backend compute demand forecast and volatility from full history. This increases the replenishment horizon (captures slower deliveries) while mu_hat/sigma_hat default will let backend balance service vs holding cost given profit/holding parameters.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=289. History shows variable & occasionally extended lead times with recent trend toward 2 periods; pipeline is large but arrivals have been delayed in past. To be conservative and allow the OR engine to plan for slower deliveries I set L explicitly=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from history; this balances service (higher base stock because of L=2) against holding cost given current large in-transit.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand 0, in-transit 289. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times with recent longer deliveries (most recent observed lead_time=3). To be responsive to recent upward shift in lead time while letting the OR engine compute demand sizing from the full sample set, I set L via recent_N=4 (captures the last 4 observed lead times), and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat at default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the provided demand samples. This increases safety stock implicitly to cover longer/more-variable lead times while avoiding overfitting demand forecast to noisy short-term swings. In-transit=289 will be compared by backend against the new base_stock; if pipeline already covers (1+L) demand, orders will be reduced by the capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Lead time has trended upward recently: last 4 observed lead_times = {3,2,2,2}, average = 2.25 (evidence of more frequent >2-period deliveries).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=289. Historical demand samples mean=65.8/week (samples provided). Recent lead-time evidence (Periods up through 42) shows upward drift (recent observed lead_times include 3,2,2,2 \u2192 avg>2) and multiple delayed/missing arrivals earlier, so I conservatively set lead time explicit=3 to protect against further late deliveries. Given large pipeline (289) relative to expected demand, use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine will likely place no new order this period and avoid extra holding cost while we await in-transit arrivals.

To reflect recent delivery behavior I set L using recent_N of the last 4 observed lead times. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this balances higher pipeline uncertainty from longer LT while letting the backend calculate safety stock using profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Historical concluded lead-times show recent upward drift (last observed lead_times include 3,2,2,2 \u2192 avg 2.25) and several prolonged delivery gaps earlier, so I set lead time explicitly > promised to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline. Demand history shows no newly confirmed sustained regime shift, so use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend uses all samples weighted by the chosen L. This balances higher safety stock (to avoid stockouts given longer effective lead time) vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute z* from profit/holding cost and apply the capped order cap.

Historical concluded lead times show an upward trend toward >2 periods (recent observed lts include 3,2,2,2); to be conservative set L explicit=2.25. Demand recently is variable with a large spike (Period 42=129) but the last 5 demand samples (Periods 42-46 = 129,43,54,47,42) better reflect the current regime; use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine focuses on current demand level and volatility. These choices aim to ensure pipeline coverage over the (1+L) review+lead window while avoiding excessive stock given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.
