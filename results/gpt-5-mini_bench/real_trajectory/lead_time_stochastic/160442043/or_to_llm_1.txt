Recent weekly demand (Dec weeks) ~20\u201329; even using elevated mid-year regime (~75) the pipeline covers multiple weeks. OR recommends 0; given high pipeline and holding cost ($1/unit/period) placing any order risks unnecessary holding cost and possible lost shipments. Lead-time history is variable but no concluded arrivals or lost-shipment signals in the most recent periods that would force immediate replenishment. Therefore place 0 units to avoid excess holding cost and follow OR's capped recommendation.",
