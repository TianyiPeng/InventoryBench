{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows multiple 1-period lead times (Period5\u21926, 16\u219217, 18\u219219); treat actual lead time as 1 (not promised 2). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=208 (will arrive within one period given L=1). Recent demand is low: last four weeks (Periods 43\u201346) = 17, 19, 27, 20 \u2192 mean \u224821 units/week. Requirement rule: order + on-hand + in-transit should cover (L+1)=2 periods of demand \u2248 42 units. Pipeline (208) >> 42, so no additional units needed. OR recommended 83 using promised L=2 and historical volatility; I override to 0 to avoid unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) because profit margin does not justify overstock given ample incoming supply. Strategy: place no order this period, monitor confirmed arrivals next period to update pipeline and keep ordering only when pipeline < ~2\xd7recent mean (\u224842).",
