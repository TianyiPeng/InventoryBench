Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Recent historical weekly demand mean = 43.6 (5 samples: 54,38,37,54,35). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time is 2; no evidence of lead-time shifts or lost shipments. Profit/holding implies a high service target but insufficient pipeline requires ordering to cover (L+1) periods. Use default methods so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD over the 3-period review+lead horizon.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent observed demand samples (weeks in history) have mean 43.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=60 (order placed in Period 1 showed arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude \u2014 with promised L=2 this is expected; not enough evidence to change lead-time). I use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, maintaining service without overreacting to a single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=118. No concluded arrivals observed (Period1 and Period2 conclude show arrived=0 for recent orders), so actual lead time not yet confirmed; use promised lead time. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean demand ~43.6. No sustained demand regime change detected (recent two-week higher demand not yet persistent). To let the OR backend compute safety stock and cap with its formulas, use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation: L=default, mu_hat=default (use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service vs holding cost conservatively while awaiting arrival confirmations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive periods (P1-P3) where orders were placed but arrived=0, while on-hand remains 0 and in-transit=160. No concluded arrivals provide evidence to change the promised lead time, so use default lead time (promised L=2). Demand history (weekly samples 54,38,37,54,35) implies a baseline weekly mean ~43.6; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. This keeps the backend anchored to full-sample demand while acknowledging outstanding in-transit inventory (160) when it computes orders. Defaults avoid overfitting to the current disrupted arrival pattern while the missing-shipment issue is investigated.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 showed arrived=0 despite orders (P1 ordered=60, P2 ordered=58, P3 ordered=42); three consecutive missed arrivals \u2192 potential lost/delayed shipments requiring monitoring.

Daily Profit: $703.00, Daily Holding Cost: $21.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $682.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Current on-hand=21, in-transit=107. History shows one concluded arrival: Period 4 reported arrived=58 (ordered Period 2 \u2192 lead_time=2). Orders from Period 1 (60) and Period 3 (42) remain unconfirmed and may be delayed/lost. I set L via "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (evidence supports L=2). Demand forecast (mu_hat) uses "default" so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) anchored to historical weekly mean (samples: 54,38,37,54,35). Volatility (sigma_hat) uses "default" so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service (profit >> holding cost) while accounting for observed lead-time evidence and existing pipeline to avoid overstock given holding cost of $1/unit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order: ordered Period 2 arrived Period 4); P1 (ordered 60) and P3 (ordered 42) remain missing\u2014possible lost/delayed shipments, continue monitoring.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized weekly demand ~37\u201355 (historical sample mean ~43.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=140 \u2014 there are multiple outstanding orders (P1 and P3 remain missing despite earlier placements); one confirmed lead time observation (P2: ordered P2 arrived P4 \u2192 LT=2). I therefore set lead time inference to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times (confirmed LT=2). To keep the OR base-stock aligned with long-run demand samples and the promised review+lead window, I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These choices balance service (covering 3 periods of average demand) against holding cost while letting the backend apply the risk buffer (z*). I will continue monitoring missing arrivals \u2014 if shipments remain lost, I will switch to an explicit longer L.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent demand has averaged higher than the 5-sample legacy series (recent weekly demands: 55,55,37,30,43 -> mean 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=126. Orders from P1 and P3 remain missing; observed lead times = {P2:2, P5:1} suggesting variability around the promised 2. To balance service (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) I set lead time to the recent average of observed arrivals (captures drift between 1 and 2). For demand I use the last 5 demand observations to capture the recent regime (N=5). Volatility likewise based on the same recent window so the backend's base-stock and cap reflect recent variance while accounting for pipeline inventory (mitigating the effect of missing shipments).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent demand strong (weekly samples historically ~44 avg; recent weeks demand 37-55 range). On-hand=0, in-transit=164 but two earlier orders (P1,P3) remain missing while P2 showed lead_time=2 and P5 showed lead_time=1. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1} so I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times and capture current variability. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a base-stock that covers review+lead demand while respecting profit/holding tradeoff. This balances higher protection against stockouts (given missing shipments) with holding cost sensitivity.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand has risen (last 3 demands: 43,45,83) versus earlier weeks; on-hand=0, in-transit=107. History shows mixed observed lead times (1 and 2 periods) with some missing arrivals (P1 and P3 still not concluded) so promised lead time may be unreliable. I set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 period variability). I choose mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to bias the forecast and volatility toward the most recent regime (captures the recent uptick while retaining some smoothing). These settings aim to increase the target base stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window given recent higher demand, while using recent variance to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost = $1 and profit = $19.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand is volatile with a large spike in Period 8 (83) but otherwise mid-30s\u201340s; on-hand=0, in-transit=189 (some past orders have been delayed/lost historically). Observed concluded lead times = {P2->P4:2, P5->P6:1, P6->P8:2, P7->P8:1} \u2192 mixed but recent median/average ~1.67. To balance service vs holding cost: set L using recent observed lead times (capture current variability) and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 demand periods (Periods 5\u20139) to reflect the recent spike and variance so the backend's base-stock and cap calculations hedge against stockouts while limiting excess holding.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has risen and become more volatile (last 5 demands: 43,45,83,41,58; avg\u224854). On-hand=24, in-transit=121; some early orders remain missing but recent arrivals show mixed lead times. I set L via recent_N to capture the most recent realized lead-time mix rather than the promised 2. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent higher mean and volatility (captures the period-8 spike). These parameters will raise the backend base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window while accounting for increased variance, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/29 (Period 12). Recent demand has risen: last 5 concluded weekly demands = [45,83,41,58,64] (avg 58.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=188 \u2014 substantial pipeline but earlier periods showed missed/lost arrivals; recent observed lead times show variability (last 5 LT = [2,1,2,1,1], avg ~1.4). To balance service vs holding cost I use a recent-average lead time (captures the shorter-than-promised recent L) and recent demand statistics (captures the recent higher demand regime) so the OR engine's base-stock and cap reflect current demand and LT variability while avoiding overreliance on stale data or lost-order noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): on-hand=0, in-transit=223. Recent observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,1] (avg\u22481.4) and recent demand is elevated (last 5 demands = 83,41,58,64,73; mean\u224863.8). Use recent lead-time average to reflect the faster/variable fulfillment; use recent_N(5) for demand and volatility to capture the recent higher-demand regime and avoid under-ordering. These parameters help the OR backend set a base-stock that accounts for shorter/variable lead times while sizing safety stock to recent demand variance, balancing lost-sales risk vs low holding cost (Profit $19 vs Hold $1).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=170. Recent concluded lead times show variability (last 5 observed LT avg ~1.4) and several earlier missed arrivals; continue to be cautious. I set L using a recent_N average of the last 5 observed lead times to capture the shorter recent average while retaining responsiveness to variability. Demand has risen in later periods (recent demands: 41,58,64,73,79); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base-stock on the most recent demand regime and volatility. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat for recent higher demand) against holding cost, while the recent-L estimate accounts for lead-time variability and missing shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): on-hand=0, in-transit=196. Recent concluded lead times show variability (recent sequence ~[2,1,2,1,1], avg~1.4) so I use recent_N for L to reflect recent mix. Demand has risen recently with a single large spike (163 in Period 14); to balance responsiveness and noise I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) so recent high demands influence the (1+L) forecast but single outliers are tempered. Volatility appears elevated recently, so sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture current std. These choices aim to raise target base stock enough to meet higher recent demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): on-hand=0, in-transit=385. Recent history shows variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20132 periods; average ~1.4) and several missing/delayed arrivals earlier; to hedge lost/delayed risk use inferred lead time from observed history. Set L using calculate (average of observed lead times). Demand has shifted up since Period 11 (recent demands: 64,73,79,163,141 \u2192 mean=104); use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new higher regime. Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target pipeline to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new demand regime while keeping variance estimate anchored to recent variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand is high and volatile (periods 13-16 demands: 79,163,141,139) and on-hand=0 but in-transit=440 (multiple outstanding shipments, some delayed/lost historically). Observed lead times vary around ~1.5 periods with intermittent 1\u20132 period realizations and some missing arrivals; rather than override promised LT=2, I ask the backend to compute the empirical average from concluded arrivals to capture realized variability. For demand forecast and volatility I use the defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine uses the full historical sample set adjusted for the chosen L; this balances service level (protect against recent high demand) against holding cost given the large existing pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Inventory: on-hand=139, in-transit=196. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2 periods) and some earlier missing shipments; to be conservative I let the backend compute an average observed lead time from concluded messages. Demand forecasting uses default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples) and volatility default so the OR engine applies the standard base-stock computation given profit/holding costs. This balances service (by using observed average lead time) against holding cost given current high on-hand and pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has stepped up since Period 13 (weekly demands: 79,163,141,139,105,80) indicating a higher-demand regime. On-hand=59, in-transit=196 \u2014 pipeline looks healthy but past missing arrivals (early periods) warn of variability in arrivals. Observed lead times in concluded history show variability (last 5 observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,1], avg=1.4). To balance service and holding cost: set L using recent lead-time evidence (recent_N=5) to reflect shorter average lead time vs promised 2; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand regime (recent_N=6 covering Periods 13\u201318) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and appropriate volatility, avoiding understock from higher recent demand while capping orders per backend cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=372. Recent demand has stepped up: last 5 demands (Periods 15-19) = [141,139,105,80,120], mean=117. Recent observed lead times (last 5 concluded) = [2,1,2,1,1], avg=1.4. Several earlier missed arrivals noted but recent arrivals show variable lead time around ~1\u20132. I set L using recent_N=5 to reflect the shorter average lead time (1.4) vs. promised=2. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (N=5 chosen per detected changepoint around Periods 15\u201319). These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained demand increase while reflecting observed lead-time reduction to limit over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=424. Recent observed lead times remain mixed 1\u20132 periods; last 5 observed lead times avg \u22481.4, so I use a recent_N estimate to capture this shorter effective lead time versus the promised 2. Demand has shifted higher recently (large demands in May/Jun); I use recent demand stats (last 5 periods: P16\u2013P20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime and to keep orders responsive while avoiding excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19. Using recent_N for L, mu_hat, sigma_hat makes the OR backend compute a tighter base-stock tuned to the latest demand and lead-time behavior and mitigates risk from earlier missed shipments by relying on concluded lead-time observations rather than promised LT.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=424 \u2014 large pipeline but past conclude history shows actual lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods (recent observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,1], avg=1.4). Recent demand has stepped up vs early-year samples; last 5 concluded demands = [105, 80, 120, 89, 70], mean=92.8. I set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the empirically observed shorter-than-promised average lead time while being robust to variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher-demand regime (uses last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std accordingly. This keeps service high during elevated demand while avoiding overstating uncertainty given the steady 1\u20132 period lead-time pattern and substantial in-transit stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=372. Historical concluded lead times show variability (mix of 1 and 2 periods); several earlier orders were delayed/missing but recent concludes show arrivals with 1\u20132 period lead times. Demand has shifted up since Period 13 (sustained higher weekly demand). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 13\u201322) because a clear changepoint occurred at Period 13; (1+L)\xd7mean of those recent samples better reflects the current, sustained higher regime and avoids dilution by low early-season samples. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10 to capture current volatility in the same recent regime. These choices increase target base stock to meet elevated demand while using recent volatility to limit excessive safety stock given holding cost; using calculated lead time helps accommodate observed 1\u20132 period variability and flagged delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg weekly demand increased from 43.6 (Periods 1\u20135 baseline) to 107.1 (Periods 13\u201322) \u2248 +145%; continue using recent-period estimates; previous missing/delayed shipments observed (Periods 1\u20133 missing; mixed 1\u20132 period lead times thereafter) remains under monitoring.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand regime (Periods 13\u201322) \u2248 107 units/week (\u2191 ~145% vs baseline). Observed lead times historically vary 1\u20132 periods; promised lead time=2 and recent arrivals include many 1\u20132 period outcomes. On-hand=0, in-transit=413 \u2014 ample pipeline. I set L to default (promised 2) because concluded arrivals continue to show mixed 1\u20132 periods and no sustained shift beyond promised lead time is proven. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to target the confirmed higher regime (Periods 13\u201322) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 samples; sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend builds base stock around the elevated recent mean while using the promised lead time the optimizer expects; with large in-transit stock we avoid over-ordering but keep safety for service level.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=413. Recent history shows mixed 1\u20132 period lead times (some arrivals at LT=1, others LT=2) so I use a recent average to reflect variability. Demand has shifted up earlier (Periods 13\u201322 avg ~107) but the last 10 weeks remain the best recent signal; I'll use recent_N for demand and volatility to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent regime. Choices: L as recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent LT variability; mu_hat recent_N (N=10) to capture the current elevated demand regime while smoothing short weekly noise; sigma_hat recent_N (N=10) to measure recent volatility. These settings balance service (capture higher recent mean and LT risk) against holding cost by using recent samples rather than inflating to extreme safety stock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weeks show elevated demand since Period 13 (regime avg ~107/wk); on-hand=0, in-transit=413 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 periods and recent observed lead times have fluctuated 1\u20132 periods; pipeline is large enough to cover upcoming demand variability so use promised lead time. Set mu_hat using recent-period demand to capture the higher post-changepoint mean (use last 13 weeks since the regime starting Period 13). Match sigma_hat to recent volatility over the same recent window so OR backend sizes safety stock to current higher-demand regime while capping orders via its cap formula.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=372. Recent concluded lead times show variability but the most recent 5 observed lead times average 2.0 (samples include a 3, two 2s, one 1, one 2) so use recent_N to capture current lead-time regime. Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 13; recent weekly demands (last 5 periods) remain high and volatile, so use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current mean and volatility over the review+lead period. These choices bias the OR backend toward stocking for the sustained higher demand while accounting for increased lead-time risk given recent delayed arrival (lead_time=3) evidence.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2.0 periods (last 5 observed lead times avg=2.0; samples [3,2,2,1,2])

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=372. Historical data show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 13 (weeks 13\u201327 much higher than baseline). Recent observed lead time behavior centers on 2 periods; promised lead time=2. To match demand regime and avoid stockouts, set L to default (use promised 2). Use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the post-changepoint higher mean/volatility; regime length \u224815 (Periods 13\u201327) so N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances higher service level (meeting elevated demand) against holding cost by basing safety stock on recent demand variability rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=393. Historical concluded lead times show variability but recent confirmed structure centers on ~2 periods (Period 27 insight). Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime (recent weekly demand ~100+ vs baseline ~44). To reflect recent demand and lead-time behavior I set L via recent_N using the last 5 observed lead times to capture current variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. These choices push the OR base-stock toward meeting higher demand under the observed multi-period lead-time variability while controlling holding cost by using recent-sample volatility (not an overly conservative long-history estimate).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=393. Recent demand clearly in the higher regime (recent 5 weeks demand = [76,124,110,103,98], mean\u2248102). Lead time has been variable but recent evidence supports using a short-run average (last 5 observed lead times). To align the OR engine with the current high-demand regime and observed LT variability: set L using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent lead-time behavior; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 5 demand samples (captures the ~102/week demand); set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the same recent window. This balances higher service needs from elevated demand while reflecting recent lead-time variability and avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with contract (L=2) while using recent demand samples to capture elevated demand. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=7 (last 7 demand observations periods 24\u201330) to reflect the current high-demand regime (avoids diluting with pre-shift low demand). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=7 to capture recent volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 13 (weekly demand ~107 vs ~44 baseline). Recent lead times remain variable (1\u20133 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=372 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to weekly demand, but some past shipments were delayed/lost so use recent observations. Set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times to capture current variability. Forecast demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) using the most recent 10 demand samples to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short blips. These choices bias the OR backend toward meeting high recent demand while avoiding excessive extra safety stock given the large in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=372. Recent weeks show elevated demand vs early baseline (regime shift around Period 13); recent 9-week demand (Periods 24\u201332) avg \u224884 units/week with high variability. Several past late/missing arrivals observed but lead-time observations since Period 11 are mixed around 1\u20133; using observed average lead time rather than promised to let backend account for realized variability. Set L by calculating average observed lead times; set demand and volatility using recent 9 samples to capture the post-shift regime while avoiding overweighting very old low-demand periods. These parameters balance service (protecting against stockouts given in-transit shipments may be delayed) and holding cost (large in-transit suggests not overstating mu_hat).

Demand regime remains at the higher level established from Period 13 onward (weekly demand ~100s); on-hand=0, in-transit=372 (large pipeline but many earlier shipments were delayed/missed historically). Continue to treat lead time as an empirical average (use all observed lead times) to let backend reconcile variability and potential lost shipments. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint high-demand regime to capture the sustained higher mean (use max recent window up to 20 samples). Volatility also uses the same recent window to reflect current demand dispersion. These choices bias base-stock upward to meet high current demand while relying on the OR cap to limit extreme orders given holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 13 (weekly demands ~100s); on-hand=0 but in-transit=378 units (large pipeline). Lead time historically variable but promised lead time=2 and recent evidence supports using promised lead time for the OR engine. I set L=default to let backend assume promised L=2. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 13\u201334 span ~22 weeks; cap N at 20) so mu_hat reflects recent elevated mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting high current demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate shortage risk; recent_N preserves responsiveness to the sustained regime shift.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=378. Historical demand shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 13 (weekly demands ~100s) vs baseline ~43; lead times have varied but promised=2 and recent evidence supports using promised lead time. To capture the post-changepoint demand level and recent variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data from the most recent regime (use N=20 to cover the sustained higher-demand window). This ensures the OR backend raises target stock for the new demand regime while using promised L=2 so arrivals align with supplier promise and existing pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand context: recent weekly demand (Periods 31\u201336) = [47,40,84,47,27,29] \u2014 recent pace ~46/week, lower than mid-year spike. On-hand=0, in-transit=378 (large pipeline arriving over coming periods). Promised lead time=2. No new sustained changepoint detected in lead time or demand that meets 3+ period threshold. I keep L as default (promised=2) to match contract and OR backend assumptions. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (short recent weeks show lower demand than mid-year), which avoids over-ordering given the large in-transit volume. Sigma_hat left as default to let backend compute volatility from full sample history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This combination prevents excess ordering while allowing the OR engine to size safety stock appropriately against recent demand and existing pipeline.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=378 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals not yet visible due to observation delay; past history shows variable lead times and some lost/delayed shipments but most recent confirmed promised lead time=2. Recent observed demand has dropped vs earlier peak; to reflect recent demand pattern while keeping conservative safety, I set L=default (use promised 2), mu_hat=recent_N using the last 5 demand samples to capture current short-term rate, and sigma_hat=default to let backend scale volatility over the (1+L) horizon. This balances service (use recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=378. Historical arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133, recent evidence leans to ~2) and a past sustained demand regime increase but recent 5-week demand is much lower (Periods 34\u201338 = [47,27,29,33,26], mean=32.4). To be responsive to recent demand while accounting for lead-time variability, I set L using recent observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples (covers review+lead period scaling in backend). This keeps orders aligned with current lower demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19, while recent_N for sigma captures current volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent weekly demand has fallen from the earlier high regime (~100s) back to low-30s range (Periods 35\u201339 demands = 27,29,33,26,25; recent mean \u224828). On-hand=0, in-transit=378 (large pipeline). Historical lead-time evidence is mixed but recent confirmations support promised L=2; no new multi-period lead-time loss pattern since Period 27. I set L to default (promised=2) to let the OR engine use contract lead time while we continue monitoring arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (captures the recent low-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sizes base-stock and cap to current lower demand and the large in-transit; this reduces holding cost risk given the sizable pipeline while preserving service for near-term demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=378 \u2014 substantial pipeline but no on-hand availability this decision. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (mix of 1\u20133) so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has been lower in the most recent 10 weeks (Periods 31\u201340: [47,40,84,47,27,29,33,26,25,31], recent mean \u2248 38.9) so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to reflect the current lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk. These choices let the OR engine compute base stock using recent demand and an empirically averaged lead time, balancing service level versus holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=378 units. Recent demand has fallen from the mid-year spike; last 5 weeks (Periods 37\u201341) average \u224828.4/week. Lead times remain variable historically; use an empirically estimated lead time to capture variability. Choices: L set to 'calculate' to use the average of all observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20133 period behavior); mu_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=5 to target the most recent low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands) so orders reflect current lower demand; sigma_hat uses 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings reduce over-ordering versus long-run averages while allowing the OR backend to target an appropriate service level given observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit position.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Product is seasonal underwear; historical data shows a sustained demand increase around Periods 13\u201322 but more recent weeks (Periods 38\u201342) show much lower weekly demand (26,25,31,27,42 \u2192 mean \u2248 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=378 (large pipeline). Recent lead-time history and promised lead time both center on 2 periods; no new sustained lead-time change observed. To reflect current reduced demand signal and avoid excess holding costs while pipeline is large, set L to promised (default) and base demand forecast to the very recent regime using last 5 weeks. Use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most-recent 5 samples, capturing the current lower-demand level and volatility while relying on promised lead time.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent weekly demand has declined sharply versus the mid-year peak; on-hand=0, in-transit=378 (large pipeline). Many past shipments were delayed/missed but latest concluded lead-times vary; to avoid overstating lead time I use the promised/default lead time. I detect a sustained low-demand regime since Period 35 and therefore set demand estimates using recent data (N=9) to reflect the lower mean/variance and reduce additional ordering and holding cost given the large in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: avg weekly demand decreased from 107.1 (Periods 13\u201322) to 28.6 (Periods 35\u201343) \u2248 -73%

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 35 (weekly demands ~27\u201342, avg \u2248 28.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=378 (large pipeline). Recent observed lead-time history has been mixed but promised lead time is 2. Given the confirmed low-demand regime, use recent-period demand estimates to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the current low-demand environment while the large in-transit reduces urgency to inflate safety stock. Choose L=default (use promised 2 periods). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-Period-35 low-demand regime (N=10 reflects the ~10-period low-demand window). Use recent_N N=10 for sigma_hat as well to estimate volatility from the same recent low-demand window. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit and low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=378 \u2014 pipeline supply is large relative to recent weekly demand (~20\u201340/week). Historical carry-over shows a demand drop (Period 35\u201343 avg \u224828.6) and intermittent lead-time variability, but no new sustained changes. To avoid over-ordering while reflecting the recent low-demand regime, keep promised lead time (default) and base mu_hat on recent weeks. Selected methods: L=default to respect supplier promise and avoid overcomplicating given mixed lead-time signals; mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 to use the most recent low-demand regime (captures recent weeks through Period 45); sigma_hat=default so backend scales volatility across review+lead. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit inventory and low holding cost relative to profit.

Lead-time history shows variability but previously confirmed as 2 and promised lead time is 2.
