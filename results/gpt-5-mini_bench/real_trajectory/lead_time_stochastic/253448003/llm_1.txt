Holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so ordering to cover three weeks strikes a balance between service and holding.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 is just after Christmas; no expected product-specific seasonal spike for bras\u2014demand likely low. Demand regime: recent periods (P35\u2013P46) show a sustained low-demand regime (~27 units/week); latest weeks P42\u2013P46 demands = 42,17,19,27,20 confirm low/seasonal demand. Lead time / pipeline: historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133) and earlier guidance notes in-transit can be unreliable until arrivals are observed. Current inventory: on-hand=61 and in-transit=467 (very large pipeline relative to ~27/wk demand). Cost trade-off: Holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit; excess inventory will incur avoidable holding cost. Action: do not place new orders this period to avoid excess holding costs and to observe actual arrivals and true lead time behavior before replenishing.",
