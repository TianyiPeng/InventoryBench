  "rationale": "Lead-time & demand inference: Promised L=2; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unobserved. Historical weekly demand samples give mean \u03bc\u0304=66.2 and sample std \u22488.99. For review+lead horizon (L+1=3): \u03bc\u0302=3\xd766.2=198.6, \u03c3\u0302=\u221a3\xd78.99\u224815.57. OR used these and a cap to produce 81 units. OR's base-stock (using q=19/(19+1)=0.95 \u2192 z*=1.645) would be base_stock = \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 \u2248198.6 + 1.645\xd715.57 \u2248224.2.

Final action: order 224 units (rounded from 224.2) to bring pipeline toward the base-stock and avoid costly stockouts.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows supplier lead times of 1\u20132 periods (arrivals observed from orders placed P5\u2192P6 (L=1), P11\u2192P13 (L=2), P18\u2192P19 (L=1), P20\u2192P22 (L=2), P25\u2192P27 (L=2), P30\u2192P32 (L=2), P35\u2192P36 (L=1)). No new sustained change in lead time is confirmed. Inventory & demand: on-hand=0, in-transit=1335. Recent weekly demand samples range ~50\u2013180 with occasional spikes (one 207). Historical sample mean ~66/wk; seasonal/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (holiday week) which can increase demand, but single spike (207) already seen and is not a sustained regime shift. OR recommended 0 units. Reasoning to follow OR: pipeline (1335) is large relative to typical weekly demand (\u224866\u2013120) and covers multiple future periods even allowing for L=2 and a holiday uptick; placing additional order risks unnecessary holding cost ($1/unit/period) and reduced profit contribution. Risk consideration: some past orders were lost (carry-over notes), but current visible in-transit is the planning quantity available to use; no new conclude messages indicate additional losses now. Final strategy: place 0 units to avoid increasing holding cost while relying on existing pipeline; monitor next conclude for actual arrivals and lost-shipment signals, then adjust if arrivals fail to materialize.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR (order 0): on-hand 0 but in-transit 1335 sufficiently covers multiple weeks (even with holiday uplift) and adding stock now would raise holding cost risk given no confirmed lost-shipment signal for this pipeline.",

Recent concluded arrivals show supplier sometimes delivers with L=1 or L=2 but multiple earlier orders were lost (carry-over notes).
