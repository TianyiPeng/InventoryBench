Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples: 168,172,173,123,150) shows no clear recent regime shift and no concluded arrivals (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Promised lead time is 2 periods; with zero pipeline and current period demand imminent, use default lead time so OR backend applies promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) because sample set is small and shows no sustained change. This balances service level versus holding cost conservatively given equal profit and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=193 (ordered P1) and Period1 conclude shows arrived=0 which is expected under promised lead time=2 (order placed P1 will arrive in P3). Single recent high demand (203) is not yet a sustained regime change (need \u22653 periods). Use promised lead time and default demand estimates (use full-sample mean scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend balances service level with holding cost without overreacting to a single spike.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent weekly demand history (Jan samples) mean ~157.2 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=402 (matches orders 193+209). Two consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 for prior orders \u2014 suggestive of delays but not enough (need 3+ periods) to confirm lead-time change or lost shipments. I therefore keep L as default (promised=2) and use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost while we gather more evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed weekly demand is elevated (period demands: 203, 283, 235) above the older samples. On-hand=0 and large in-transit=546 but none of the orders placed in Periods 1-3 have concluded (arrived=0), indicating shipments are delayed beyond the promised 2 periods. To avoid stockouts while acknowledging delayed arrivals, I set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand regime (uses last 5 samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I use recent_N=5 to reflect recent variability. These parameters increase the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while the explicit longer L accounts for observed shipment delay and reduces risk of underordering.

Carry-over insight: Observed shipments ordered in Periods 1-3 did not arrive by their conclude messages (arrived=0) \u2014 evidence of lead time >2 periods or lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $209.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concludes show one confirmed 2-period lead time (order on P2 arrived on P4) while other early orders either delayed or lost; on-hand=0, in-transit=587. Demand history mean = 157.2/week (5 samples). Promised L=2; given observed arrival (P2\u2192P4) I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times (will be 2). With profit=holding, critical fractile q=0.5 so z*=0; base_stock should equal mu_hat. I choose mu_hat default so backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) = 3*mean, capturing review+lead demand and smoothing limited history. sigma_hat default lets backend scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (cover 3 periods of expected demand) against holding cost while allowing the OR engine to react if further delays/losses appear.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order placed Period 2 arrived Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=587. Historical weekly samples (Jan) show mean~157, but the last 5 observed demands (Periods 1-5) are {203,283,235,228,208} with mean=231.4 \u2014 clear sustained upward shift. One concluded arrival shows actual lead time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4); no evidence of longer persistent delays for other shipments yet, so use promised lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (N=5). This gives the OR backend a (1+L)-scaled forecast reflecting the new demand level while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. L left as default to keep promised lead time (2) since confirmed by concluded arrival. On-hand + in-transit (587) will be reconciled by OR engine against pipeline; using recent_N reduces stockouts given the higher observed demand while holding cost equals profit so the service-target q=0.5 will be balanced by the backend formula.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: recent Periods 1-5 avg demand=231.4 vs prior sample mean=157.2 (+47%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent demand has shifted up and sustained (Periods 1-5 avg=231.4 vs historical sample mean=157.2, +47%). On-hand=0, in-transit=695 (large pipeline). Past conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). I set L to default (promised 2) because concluded history supports promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to anchor mu_hat to the new higher regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 observed demands). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This configuration directs the OR engine to raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while sigma based on the same recent window balances service vs holding given the large in-transit position.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=695. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 4 arrival from P2) and earlier missing arrivals but current large pipeline present. Recent demand regime is higher (carry-over: recent Periods 1-5 avg=231.4 vs prior mean=157.2). To reflect the confirmed promised lead time and elevated recent demand, keep L as default (promised=2) and set demand forecast using recent_N (last 5 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets higher base-stock and captures recent volatility while the cap limits extreme orders. This balances higher service level for increased demand against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=2, in-transit=587 (these match outstanding orders from Periods 1,3,4). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (orders P2\u2192P4 and P6\u2192P8). Demand regime shift confirmed earlier (recent periods mean ~231 vs prior ~157). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=2. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Sigma set to recent_N (N=5) so volatility matches the recent regime. These choices raise base-stock to serve the higher recent demand while the calculate L avoids assuming lost shipments or longer LT.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=587 \u2014 substantial pipeline present. Historical concluded lead times: observed arrivals show consistent 2-period lead (orders P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history shows a downward shift in the most recent regime (Periods 6\u201310 avg demand = 110 vs earlier higher avg); to be responsive use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=5 (captures last 5 periods: 193,137,106,54,60). These choices keep L aligned with observed deliveries and set mu_hat/sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime so the OR engine reduces ordering despite large pipeline, balancing service level and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=587. Historical conclude messages show confirmed actual lead time = 2 (arrivals: P2->P4, P6->P8). Recent visible demand (Periods 7-11) is low, so no new sustained upshift vs earlier samples. Use promised/default lead time to keep consistency with observed confirmations. Use default demand and volatility scaling (backend will apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the full sample set) because there is insufficient recent sustained evidence to override the long-run sample statistics; this avoids overreacting to short low-demand run and lets the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=587 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show actual observed lead times = 2 (orders placed P2->arrived P4; P6->arrived P8) though earlier shipments were delayed/lost. Recent demand (Periods 8-12 = 106,54,60,44,35) is materially lower than the earlier spike; to avoid excess holding given equal profit/holding ($1/$1) I forecast using the most recent 5 demand samples. Therefore: set L by calculate (average of observed lead times = 2); set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture current lower-demand regime over the review+lead window; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps orders aligned with the latest demand while the large in-transit inventory prevents urgent ordering.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent on-record demands have dropped (Periods 9-13: 54,60,44,35,22) vs earlier higher regime; confirmed lead time=2 in history (arrivals from P2->P4, P6->P8). On-hand=0 but in-transit=587 units \u2014 sufficient to cover several (L+1)-period demand forecasts. I use L=default (promised 2) because concluded messages confirm 2-period lead time. To reflect the clear recent downward demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, avoiding overweighting older high-demand weeks. This keeps orders low while in-transit stock clears, balancing service vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent on-hand 0, large in-transit 587. Concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 2 (orders P2->P4, P6->P8). Demand has dropped substantially in the last 5 concluded periods (P10-P14 = 60,44,35,22,19); using a recent-N forecast prevents over-ordering given the large pipeline. Set L to default (promised) which matches confirmed actual=2. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime and reduce target base-stock so the OR engine will cap orders given the large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=587 (large pipeline from prior orders). Recent concluded lead-times show consistent 2-period arrivals; no new prolonged losses. Recent realized weekly demand has fallen sharply (most recent 5 concluded demands = [44,35,22,19,19], mean ~27.8) vs earlier samples, so use a short-term recent estimate to avoid triggering further receipts given large in-transit stock. Choose L=default (promised=2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime and recent volatility; this keeps base_stock aligned to near-term demand and lets the cap/pipeline check prevent further ordering while in-transit inventory is high.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=587 \u2014 large pipeline present. Recent observed demand has fallen markedly (Periods 11-16 avg \u224825.3). Historical seed samples (early 2019) show much higher means but are no longer representative. Lead-time observations (arrivals recorded: P4 for P2 order, P8 for P6 order) consistently indicate a 2-period actual lead time; use calculated lead time to reflect observed history. Use recent_N (last 6 concluded demand periods: Periods 11-16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime so the OR backend sets a much smaller base stock and avoids excessive holding cost despite a large in-transit position. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost, preventing overstocking while honoring the confirmed LT=2.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg decreased to 25.3 (Periods 11-16) vs prior recent avg 231.4 (earlier periods) \u2014 sustained 6 periods (~-89%).

Current on-hand=0, in-transit=587 (large pipeline). Given confirmed LT=2 and a clear low-demand regime, set L to calculated average of observed lead times (2). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 11\u201316) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and variability estimates despite the large pipeline, avoiding further excess ordering and high holding costs.

Observed concluded lead times: two confirmed arrivals indicate lead_time=2. I set L via calculate (use observed lead times avg=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 11\u201318) to capture the sustained low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets much lower base stock and avoids additional heavy ordering while the large in-transit stock works down.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has fallen sharply and stabilized at low levels since Period 11 (recent 9-period avg \u224820.3 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=587 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = 2 periods (orders from P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8); promised lead time=2, so use default promised L to align with OR engine. To avoid overstocking given the sustained low-demand regime, forecast demand using recent data: mu_hat recent_N using last 9 periods (Periods 11\u201319) to capture the new low mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=9 to reflect recent reduced variability. These parameters reduce target base-stock relative to historical high-demand regime and limit ordering despite large in-transit pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent history shows demand collapsed starting Period 11 and has remained low (Periods 11-20 mean=18.6 units/week). Lead-time observations from concluded messages consistently show 2-period arrivals (orders from P2 arrived P4; P6 arrived P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=587. I set L by calculate (average of observed lead times=2) to reflect confirmed LT=2. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 11-20) to capture the sustained low-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to hold much lower base stock given the persistent drop in demand while respecting observed lead time and existing large in-transit pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 11 (Periods 11-21 demand low; earlier high regime already recorded). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=587 units (sufficient to cover upcoming demand), so avoid inflating forecast. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 2 (orders placed P2->arrived P4, P6->P8), so set L by calculating observed lead time. For demand forecasting use recent_N over the low-demand regime to reflect the new baseline: choose N=11 (Periods 11-21) per changepoint rule. Use recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility. These parameters keep the backend's base-stock tied to the depressed demand, avoiding excess holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=587 (large pipeline). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=2 in multiple events; recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 11 (Periods 11-22 demand average ~25.3). To avoid over-ordering given large pipeline and low sustained demand, keep L as promised (default=2). Forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=12 (Periods 11-22) and match sigma_hat to the same recent window (recent_N N=12). This keeps the OR base-stock tuned to the confirmed low-demand regime and prevents excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 in prior observations and multiple sustained demand regime shifts earlier; current recent demand is low with a single spike in Period 23 (109) but not yet a sustained new regime. Given the large pipeline, I will keep the promised lead time and let the OR backend compute demand forecasts from historical samples (default methods) to avoid creating additional orders that would increase holding cost while in-transit stock is outstanding.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=587. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times = 2 periods (orders placed P2\u2192arrived P4, P6\u2192arrived P8); earlier missed arrivals appear resolved, so use calculated lead time average. Recent demand is volatile: last 5 concluded weekly demands = [3,5,2,109,73] (mean ~38.4) \u2014 a short recent rebound after a prolonged low regime. To balance service vs. holding cost given profit=holding= $1, I use a short-window recent_N forecast (N=5) so mu_hat captures the recent uptick without over-committing inventory; sigma_hat uses same recent window to reflect elevated volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to recent demand while limiting excess inventory risk given uncertain shipment history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=587. Recent demand has rebounded (Periods 23-25: 109,73,89) after a long low-demand regime; past concluded arrivals show actual observed lead times = 2 periods (consistent). Given in-transit stock is large but arrivals are unseen until next conclude, set L to calculate (uses observed lead times). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent 3-period uptick (prevents understock if spike persists). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (capture recent spike) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=587 \u2014 large pipeline available despite recent history of delayed shipments; recent demand has spiked weeks 23-26. Promised lead time=2 has been confirmed by multiple conclude messages, so use default L to let backend assume 2. I detect a new demand regime starting Period 23 (sustained 4 weeks high demand), so compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 4 samples to capture the shift while leveraging the large in-transit inventory to avoid stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: avg increased to 118.75 (Periods 23-26) vs prior avg 25.3 (Periods 11-16), +369% (sustained 4 periods).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has rebounded sharply since Period 23 (last 5 weeks: 109,73,89,204,440; mean=183), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the new regime. Observed conclude messages show consistent lead times of 2 (orders from P2\u2192P4 and P6\u2192P8), so average observed lead time =2. In-transit =587 units already covers (1+L) periods of demand; using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) adapts the base-stock to the elevated demand while sigma recent_N captures current volatility. L method set to calculate to lock to observed lead time and avoid depending on potentially-lost earlier shipments.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand has rebounded sharply since Period 23 (demands: 109,73,89,204,440,414) \u2014 sustained high demand (avg\u2248221.5 over last 6 periods) vs earlier low regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=587 (sizable pipeline). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods in conclude history (use promised/default). Set L=default to use promised 2. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L) scaling done in backend). Use recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat as well to reflect volatility in these recent samples. This balances higher service level to meet the sustained surge while backend cap limits orders relative to pipeline to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has risen sharply since Period 23 (weeks 23-29: 109,73,89,204,440,414,329) indicating a sustained high-demand regime; historical earlier periods were much lower. On-hand=0, in-transit=665\u2014pipeline is substantial and likely covers multiple review+lead periods. Promised lead time has been observed as 2 periods in concluded history (Period 4 and 8 arrivals), so use default promised L=2. For demand forecast use recent data from the current high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 23-29) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the new higher mean and measured volatility while the capped order cap will limit over-ordering given pipeline. This balances service level during the demand spike against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=711. Historical concluded lead-time observations show arrivals with lead_time=2 (Period2->4, Period6->8); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand has clearly shifted upward since Period 23; I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 23-30) to capture the current high-demand regime (mean \u2248264.4/week over those 8 weeks) and match the review+lead horizon. Sigma also set to recent_N with N=8 to reflect volatility in this recent regime. These parameters will raise base_stock to satisfy service during the (1+L) horizon while accounting for higher demand variability; using observed lead-time via calculate helps avoid underordering from earlier lost/delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Updated demand regime (Periods 23-30): avg demand=264.375 vs prior recent avg 25.3 (Periods 11-16); sustained high demand across 8 periods (Periods 23-30).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=738 \u2014 large pipeline present but historical arrivals show some variability in lead time (observed lead times: 2,2,2,1). Demand has been in the high regime since Period 23 (Periods 23-30 avg=264.375, sustained 8 periods). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures mix of 2s and a 1). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 8 samples). For volatility I also use recent_N N=8 to capture recent demand variability. These choices bias orders toward meeting the recent high demand while letting the OR engine incorporate computed safety stock given profit/holding parity (profit=holding) and the backend caps order quantity.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=900. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed concluded lead_times = [2,2,2,1] from recent arrivals at Periods 4,8,32); average ~1.75 so I use recent_N for L to capture this short-term mix. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime starting Period 23 and sustained through Period 33 (11 weeks of elevated demand); I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 to base the review+lead demand forecast and volatility on the current high-demand regime. This selection balances service (capture current high mean) while letting the OR engine compute a conservative base_stock (profit=holding implies z*=0) and the capped order size will limit excessive single-period orders. The parameters account for delayed/mixed lead-time evidence by using a recent average lead_time instead of the default promised value.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical conclude messages show most observed lead times = 2 (one observed 1), and multiple earlier long gaps but later confirms point to L\u22482. Recent demand since Period 23 shows a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 23-34, length 12) \u2014 use recent data to set demand forecast and volatility so the OR engine targets service during this high regime while accounting for pipeline. Choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the occasional 1 but majority 2). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=12 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the sustained high-demand regime. For sigma_hat use recent_N N=12 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize meeting higher recent demand given large in-transit and avoid underordering due to stale low-demand samples.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 23 with large weekly volumes (notably Periods 29-33). Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,2,1,3] \u2192 average ~2.0. On-hand is 0 with 827 units in-transit (large pipeline). To capture the recent high-demand regime while respecting observed lead time variability I set L to 'calculate' (avg observed lead time = 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to focus forecasting on the most recent 7 demand observations (periods 29-35) so the OR backend targets sufficient base stock for the current elevated demand while limiting exposure to older low-demand periods. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given large recent demand) against holding cost given already-large in-transit pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows demand returned to a high regime since Period 23 (sustained) and current on-hand=83 with large in-transit=665. Several concluded arrivals show actual lead times varying (1\u20133), with two recent 3-period arrivals; to be conservative use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. Use default demand sizing (backend (1+L)\xd7mean) and default volatility so OR engine recomputes base stock given our inferred L while leveraging full historical samples. This balances service (large pipeline + elevated recent demand) vs holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=3, in-transit=665; recent concluded lead times vary (observed Ls include 1\u20133, average ~2.17) and recent demand is the higher regime established around Periods 23\u201330. I select L='calculate' so backend estimates average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures recent 1\u20133 variability). For demand I use recent_N, N=8 to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 23\u201330, regime_length=8) so the base-stock reflects current elevated demand. Using recent data reduces risk of understock given large in-transit volume and equal profit/holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z*\u22480), letting mu_hat drive the order while sigma_hat (recent_N) captures recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=665. Historical concluded lead times show variability: [2,2,2,1,3,3] (most recent three = 1,3,3 -> avg ~2.33) so I use a recent_N estimate to capture the short-term increase in lead time. Demand has clearly experienced multiple regime shifts; the most recent realized demand (Periods 32-38 = 159,284,126,95,79,80,67) indicates a lower but still elevated post-spike average versus the long-run sample. To be responsive to the recent realized demand level while avoiding overreacting to earlier spikes, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and match sigma_hat to the same recent window. These choices (recent lead time and recent demand mean/volatility) let the OR engine target service with a base-stock reflecting current pipeline and recent demand while capping orders per its cap formula. Given on-hand=0 and large in-transit, using recent estimates prevents unnecessary new orders if pipeline already covers (1+L) periods of demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=665 (large pipeline from many prior orders). Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,2,1,3,3} (avg \u22482.17) showing actual LT \u22482 with occasional 1\u20133 variability and some earlier lost shipments. Demand regimes changed: sustained high demand from Periods 23\u201330 and continuing variability thereafter; I use recent data to capture the current higher-demand regime. Choices: L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures 1\u20133 variability around promised 2). mu_hat using recent_N with N=17 (covers Periods 23\u201339 recent high/variable regime) so forecast reflects current elevated demand across review+lead; sigma_hat recent_N N=17 to reflect recent volatility. These settings rely on recent realized demand and observed lead-time average so the OR backend will target service while avoiding excess holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=665. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W = [2,2,2,1,3,3], average \u22482.17) so I use an empiric average rather than promised to capture that variability and overdue/lost risk. Recent demand has moderated from prior spikes; last 9 concluded demands (Periods 32\u201340) average \u2248109 units/week, so I set mu_hat from the recent 9-sample regime to reflect current demand level across review+lead. Demand volatility appears elevated vs older low-demand regime, so I use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N=9 to reflect current variability. These choices (L=calculated average lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent 9) align the OR backend to hold enough pipeline for (1+L) periods of the current demand regime while avoiding overstating demand from earlier spikes. I expect the OR engine to compute base_stock and cap using these inputs to balance the 1:1 profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=665. Historical conclude messages show variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods) but promised=2; many earlier shipments were delayed/lost. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (uses concluded evidence) so we account for the mixed observed lead-time behavior. Demand has exhibited multiple regime shifts; recent weeks (Periods 34\u201341 demands = 126,95,79,80,67,66,26,19) are substantially lower than the high regime around Periods 23\u201330. I use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 8 weeks, capturing the recent downward demand trend while smoothing a bit across two months. These choices reduce over-ordering given the large in-transit inventory and recent demand drop while allowing the backend to set a conservative base stock given observed lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift beginning Period 39: avg demand Periods 39-41 = 37.0 (66,26,19) vs prior recent avg 264.375 (Periods 23-30) \u2014 sustained low demand for 3 periods (~-86%).

Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 39 but with a small rebound (demands 66,26,19,83); to be responsive I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 weeks. These choices keep the backend's base-stock responsive to the recent low-demand regime while the recent_N lead-time estimate captures observed lead-time variability without overreacting to single anomalous arrivals.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 39 (demands: 66,26,19,83,35; mean=45.8 over last 5 periods). Observed concluded lead times vary (observed: 2,2,2,1,3,3 \u2192 avg \u22482.17), so I use an estimated average lead time rather than the promised default. On-hand=0 and in-transit=665 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent demand and will likely cover multiple L+1 periods, so ordering should be conservative. Decisions: set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to capture actual variability; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (recent low-demand regime) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, avoiding overstocking given the large in-transit position.

Observed concluded lead times show variability (observed W = [2,2,2,1,3,3], avg \u22482.17). On-hand=0, in-transit=665 so pipeline is large; to avoid overreacting to past high peaks while accounting for variable lead time, I set L by averaging the recent observed lead times and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 6 demand periods to capture the current low-demand regime. These choices help the OR backend compute a base-stock that reflects current low demand and slightly longer-than-promised effective lead time, reducing stockouts from delayed arrivals while limiting excess holding given holding cost = profit.

On-hand=0, in-transit=665 (large pipeline). Promised lead time retained to avoid over-correcting for intermittent late arrivals. To align the backend forecast with the current low-demand regime and avoid prompting further orders (given large in-transit), I use recent_N methods (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base_stock reflects the most recent 7 weeks' low demand. L uses default (promised lead time=2). These settings reduce reorder targets and holding risk while preserving service given the large pipeline inventory.

Demand has entered a sustained low regime since Period 39 (8 periods of low weekly demand); I set mu_hat and sigma_hat as recent_N with N=8 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the current low-demand regime. These choices keep target base-stock conservative (lower \u03bc\u0302) to avoid holding cost while respecting pipeline arrivals.
