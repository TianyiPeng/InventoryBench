  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, pre-NewYear) \u2014 apparel demand typically depressed after holiday promotions. Demand regime analysis: recent concluded weeks (P43\u2013P46) show minimal demand [0,3,1,1] \u2014 consistent low December demand. Historical summer spikes are irrelevant now. Lead-time / in-transit: on-hand=0, in-transit=910 units (no new conclude messages confirming arrivals); per rules do not assume these will arrive this period and treat lead-time evidence conservatively (no new confirmed change). Inventory & pipeline: large in-transit position (910) already likely to cover any low near-term demand; holding cost is high relative to likely sales in the coming weeks. Final order logic: do not place additional stock given very low observed demand and substantial in-transit pipeline to avoid unnecessary holding cost and preserve profit.",
