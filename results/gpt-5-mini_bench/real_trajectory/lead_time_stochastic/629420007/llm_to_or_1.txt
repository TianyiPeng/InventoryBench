Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). History: five weekly samples (119,73,98,97,113) covering Jan\u2013early Feb. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals -> no evidence of lead-time change or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend computes base_stock with L=2. Use default demand estimates (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and default volatility so estimates reflect full historical sample set and avoid overfitting to sparse data. This balances service level (covering review+lead demand) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). SKU 629420007 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=130 (order placed P1). Demand history mean=100 units/week (5 samples). The P1 order showing arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude is expected given promised lead time=2 (arrival will only conclude in Period 3), so no evidence shipments are lost or lead time has shifted. To balance service level vs holding cost I use the backend defaults: keep promised lead time, and use all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies its base-stock/cap logic using full historical demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly samples (119,73,98,97,113) give mean=100. On-hand=0, in-transit=279; two recent orders placed have not concluded (arrived=0) but no concluded arrivals yet so cannot confirm lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) and demand estimates from full-sample statistics: (1+L)\xd7mean gives coverage for the next (L+1) periods while keeping parameters conservative given possible delayed shipments. This balances service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost by using standard sample mean/variance rather than overreacting to two unconfirmed missed arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 but no concluded arrivals in Periods 1-3 (orders placed P1=130, P2=149, P3=158 all arrived=0) \u2014 suggests shipments delayed/lost. Demand history (historical weekly samples mean=100) but recent realized demand in decision periods is much higher (P1=147, P2=214, P3=181). To protect service given sustained elevated recent demand and likely longer effective lead time, I set L explicit=3 (conservative increase above promised 2). I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead demand forecast and volatility on the three most recent high-demand periods so the OR engine raises base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while acknowledging elevated demand and transit uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed P1(130), P2(149), P3(158) all arrived=0 in their conclude messages \u2192 sustained non-arrival over 3 periods; treat as lost/delayed.

Daily Reward (R_t): $401.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent concludes show sustained non-arrivals for P1/P3 but P2 order arrived in P4 indicating actual observed lead time = 2. Historical weekly demand samples (119,73,98,97,113) give mean=100 units/week. Promised lead time=2; one confirmed observation supports using averaged/observed lead time. I choose L='calculate' so backend will compute average observed lead time (2). For demand I use default (1+L)*mean => (1+2)*100=300 as the backend default; this captures the review+lead demand. Volatility left to backend default to reflect sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings keep target base-stock sized for 3-period coverage given confirmed 2-period lead time while letting the OR engine cap orders; this balances service (profit $4 vs hold $1) versus holding cost and accounts for past missing shipments by using observed lead-time calculation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order arrived in Period 4: ordered P2, arrived P4 \u2192 lead_time=2)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=524. Concluded history shows an actual lead time of 2 (P2\u2192P4) and earlier missing arrivals (P1,P3) but no new sustained patterns since last insights. Use calculated L to capture observed lead-time=2 from concluded messages. Use default demand and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) based on historical weekly samples (119,73,98,97,113) to keep the OR backend anchored to long-run estimates while the calculated L accounts for recent delivery behavior and protects against underordering given in-transit stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=524. Historical demand shows a sustained higher recent regime (Periods 1-6 demands = 147,214,181,110,142,160) so I use recent data to capture current mean/volatility. Lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods by concluded arrivals (P2\u2192P4), so keep promised/default lead time. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the full available recent sample set (N=6) to reflect the current demand level and variability while the OR backend handles service-level cap constraints. No new shipment-loss insight added here.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01 (Period 8). Recent weeks show large spike in demand (period demands: 110,142,160,260) and multiple missing arrivals earlier; current on-hand=0 but in-transit=529 units (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead time evidence: P2\u2192arrived P4 implies actual lead_time=2. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (confirming 2). For mu_hat I use EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.5) to weight recent high-demand weeks more heavily while still retaining baseline from older samples, producing a (1+L)-period forecast that reacts moderately to the recent surge. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility including the demand spike. These choices balance higher target stocking to avoid stockouts given recent surge and confirmed 2-period lead time, while sigma and EWMA limit overreaction and control holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=694. History shows mixed lead-time observations: P2\u2192P4 arrived (LT=2) and P7\u2192P8 arrived (LT=1); multiple earlier orders (P1,P2,P3) experienced non-arrival over several periods. Demand has accelerated recently (periods 6-8 = 160, 260, 311). To balance service vs holding cost: set L by averaging the two most recent observed lead times to reflect recent variability; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demand periods to capture the new higher-demand regime and increased volatility. These parameters help the OR backend target a higher base-stock for the elevated demand while limiting excess inventory given uncertain arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg increased from 159 to 244 (+53%)

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=843; recent history shows missing/lost shipments early (P1-P3) but lead-time observations include P2\u2192P4 (2 periods) and P7\u2192P8 (1 period). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (P6..P9 = 160,260,311,283). To reflect confirmed lead-time observations I use calculated average lead time. For demand I target the post-changepoint regime using recent_N over the last 4 periods (P6\u2013P9) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the raised mean and volatility; this balances higher service needs against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 Period 11. On-hand=1, in-transit=538. Historical concluded lead times observed = {2,1,2,1} (avg 1.5). Demand shows sustained higher regime since Period 6 (recent demands: P6..P10 = 160,260,311,283,318; mean=266.4). I set L to the recent average of observed lead times to reflect mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use the recent 5-sample regime (P6\u2013P10) to capture the post-changepoint higher mean and variance, so the OR backend will size base-stock for the elevated demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=892. History shows earlier lost/delayed shipments (P1\u2013P3 non-arrivals), then confirmed regime shift at Period 6 (mean demand up ~+53%). Observed concluded lead times = {P2->P4:2, P7->P8:1, P8->P10:2, P9->P10:1} \u2192 average \u22481.5. To capture the persistent higher-demand regime since Period 6, I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=6 (periods 6\u201311). I use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices raise target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window given higher demand while using recent samples to avoid diluting the estimate with older low-demand history.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 6 (post-change samples: 160,260,311,283,318,396,340). On-hand=0, in-transit=978 \u2014 large pipeline but several earlier orders were delayed/lost; rely on observed concluded lead times rather than promised. Set L by 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals). For demand, use recent_N with N=7 (the 7 samples since the detected regime shift) so mu_hat reflects the higher post-change mean over the review+lead window. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to reflect realized post-change volatility. These choices prioritize meeting higher recent demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and avoiding excess overstock given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand regime since Period 6 shows a sustained higher mean (~+53%), so I base demand forecast on the post-changepoint regime. Pipeline: on-hand=161, in-transit=640 (some earlier shipments were lost/delayed but lead time has been repeatedly observed as ~2). Set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (mostly 2, average ~1.6) while acknowledging some 1-period arrivals. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint demand mean/volatility (Periods 6\u201313). This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost by scaling forecasts to the confirmed higher-demand regime rather than older low-demand data.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). On-hand=17, in-transit=714. Historical concludes show observed lead times mostly 2 (some 1), and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (higher mean). To respect supplier promise and recent empirical evidence, set L to be calculated from observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Period 6 onward) to capture the higher demand level (regime length = 9 periods \u2192 N=9). Use sigma_hat recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the backend toward higher base stock appropriate for the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using observed lead-time behavior; this also guards against earlier lost shipments by relying on concluded lead-time observations rather than unarrived orders.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=922. Historical concludes show mixed actual lead times but majority=2 with some 1s and earlier lost shipments; demand increased at Period 6 (+53%). Set L to the average of observed lead times to reflect mixture (captures occasional 1s and common 2s). For demand, use recent_N over the post-shift regime (Period6 onward) to reflect the higher demand level; choose N=10 (covers Periods 6\u201315) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher mean and volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat sized to cover variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=928. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-period arrivals (with occasional 1); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 6 (recent demand samples Period6\u201316 avg \u2248270 units/week); use recent_N with N=11 to capture the current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit; recent_N reduces sensitivity to older low-demand samples and helps the OR engine size orders to meet the sustained higher demand while capping orders via the backend cap.

History shows mixed lead-times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1) with average ~1.625; several early periods had missing arrivals but recent concludes show arrivals, so use inferred average lead time. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1 and current large pipeline.

Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods with occasional 1-period arrivals; recent sequence (many 2s) supports using a short averaged lead time rather than default. Demand regime elevated since Period 6 (carry-over note: avg rose ~+53%), so forecast using recent-period demand samples from the new regime. I set L as the recent average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1/2 outcomes). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples from the post-change regime (N=13) so the OR backend builds base-stock to cover (1+L) periods under the higher demand level while reflecting recent volatility; this balances higher service need vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Demand regime shifted up (Period 6) so recent higher-demand regime should drive forecast. To capture the confirmed longer lead-time tendency while weighting recent elevated demand, set L by calculating the average observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to reflect the sustained higher mean and volatility (N chosen to cover the regime).

Demand recently (Periods 16-20) = [218,160,124,135,109], average ~149. Use recent lead-time estimate to reflect observed variability but weight recent confirmations of 2. Set L as recent_N (N=6) to average the last 6 observed lead times (captures mix of 2s and 1s and ignores early lost orders). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)-period demand on the most recent demand regime (last 5 weeks) rather than long-run historical that includes earlier spikes; this keeps orders responsive to current lower demand and limits holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6 (carry-over: avg rose ~+53% to ~244/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=867 (large pipeline). Many past arrivals imply actual lead times ~1\u20132 with majority at 2; use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to let backend infer current average. For demand I use recent_N to focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6\u201321) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher, sustained demand; choose N=16 (regime length). This balances service (higher \u03bc\u0302 to avoid stockouts given large in-transit uncertainty) versus holding cost by leveraging pipeline and recent-demand stats.

Given large in-transit and recent sustained drop in realized demand, use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost using full-sample stats while accounting for the inferred lead time. This approach avoids over-ordering despite a large pipeline and recent demand decline, and lets the OR cap reduce new orders if pipeline already covers (1+L) demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline starting Period 17: avg demand P6-P16 ~244 vs P17-P23 avg ~106 (\u2248\u221257%), sustained for 7 periods

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent history shows a sustained demand decline starting Period 17 (P17-P24 avg \u2248106 vs earlier avg \u2248244). On-hand=0, in-transit=867 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals are observed with promised lead_time=2 and some earlier lost shipments; however lead time has been confirmed as 2 by concluded messages. To avoid overstating demand I use a recent_N forecast (most recent low-demand regime P17-P24) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory consistent with the lower demand. I keep L=default (promised lead time=2) because concluded evidence supports L=2 and lost shipments are historical; using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat/sigma_hat focuses the base stock on the current low-demand regime and reduces holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 17 (avg \u2248106 over P17-P23 and continued low volumes through P25). On-hand=0, in-transit=867 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2; recent concluded lead-time observations support 2. I select L=default to use the promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the sustained low-demand regime starting Period 17 (regime length 9 periods), so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower mean and volatility. This prevents the OR engine from inflating orders based on older high-demand data while the large in-transit position limits new receipts; combined choices reduce overstock risk while maintaining service for the present low-demand regime.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=867. Historical conclude messages show confirmed lead_time=2 for several orders and a sustained demand decline starting Period 17 (P17-P23 avg \u2248106 vs earlier \u2248244). I set L by calculate to let the backend use observed lead-time history (confirmed=2). For demand I use recent_N N=10 to base mu_hat on the post-decline regime (Periods 17\u201326) so forecast covers the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the new lower-demand regime. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=10 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize avoiding excess inventory given large in-transit stock and the confirmed lower-demand regime, while letting the OR backend compute service-level z from profit/holding.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has declined and stabilized since Period 17 (weekly demands mostly 38\u2013109, average ~106) and on-hand=0 with large in-transit=867. Historical conclude messages confirm promised lead time=2 in recent arrivals and multiple earlier lost shipments but no new sustained lead-time change. To avoid overstocking given high in-transit and lower recent demand, keep promised lead time (default) but forecast using the recent low-demand regime (Period 17 onward). Selected mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (length of the low-demand regime, Periods 17\u201327) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant data, reducing risk of excessive orders while accounting for variability.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows a sustained demand decline starting Period 17 (P17-P28 lower regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=867 (large pipeline). Multiple past shipments were lost/delayed but concluded lead times consistently include 2-period arrivals; therefore use observed-average lead time. To avoid overstocking given low recent demand and nontrivial holding cost, I set demand estimates using the recent low-demand regime (last 12 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean and volatility. These parameters keep the base-stock tied to recent demand (reducing holding cost) while L calculated from observed lead times captures realized delays.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has been in the low-30s per week since the decline beginning Period 17; last 6 observed demands (P24-P29) average \u224829.8, so I will base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=867 (large pipeline) \u2014 no urgent replenishment needed. Promised lead time is 2 and historical concluded messages confirm lead_time=2 in multiple instances, so use default lead time. Choose mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and lower volatility; this keeps base stock small and avoids holding cost while preserving service given the large in-transit position.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 17 (P17-P30 avg ~106 -> recent weeks falling to 11), on-hand=0, in-transit=867. Earlier carry-over confirmed lead time=2 and multiple lost/delayed shipments historically, but recent concluded arrivals are consistent with promised lead time. To avoid overstock given current low demand, use promised lead time (default) and compute mu_hat/sigma_hat from the recent low-demand regime (use last N=14 periods, P17-P30) so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand under the current regime and keeps safety stock proportional to observed recent volatility.

Recent history shows a sustained demand decline starting Period 17 (periods 17\u201323 avg \u2248106) and multiple lost/delayed shipments earlier, but concluded lead-time observations consistently support the promised L=2 in many periods. On-hand is 0 with a large in-transit pipeline (867 units) from prior orders; given heavy pipeline I avoid increasing forecasted demand or safety stock. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, letting the engine cap orders using its cap formula. This prevents over-ordering on top of the large in-transit volume while maintaining service level per profit/holding tradeoff.

I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent low-demand regime to reflect the sustained drop (capture current mean and volatility). This keeps base stock aligned to current low demand and prevents excess holding given holding cost > 0.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent history shows the sustained demand decline beginning Period 17 (documented previously) with low weekly demand since then; on-hand=0, in-transit=867 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 but recent concluded arrivals have been mixed; no new sustained lead-time change since prior confirmation of 2. To align ordering with the lower post-changepoint demand and to avoid excess holding cost given large in-transit, I use a demand estimate focused on the low-demand regime (recent samples since Period 17). L left at default (promised) to keep OR engine assumptions consistent; mu_hat and sigma_hat set using recent_N over the detected low-demand regime (N=18 periods, Periods 17\u201334) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent low-demand data, which reduces order targets and limits additional pipeline buildup.

Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 17 (weekly demand ~38\u219213 range) after an earlier high regime; pipeline is large (in-transit=867) while on-hand=0 and many earlier shipments were lost/delayed but concluded lead-time observations exist.

For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 17\u201335) to base mu_hat on the confirmed lower-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=19 to capture volatility in this recent regime. These choices reduce ordering against an already-large in-transit pipeline and align stock targets with the sustained lower demand, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Current context: on-hand=0, in-transit=867. Historical demand shows the sustained decline starting Period 17 (post-peak regime) \u2014 recent weekly demand has been very low (Periods 17-36 average << earlier peak). Recent pipeline is large (867) so avoid aggressive replenishment; keep promised lead time. To capture the current low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (use N=20 to cover Periods 17-36). L left as default (promised lead time = 2). This balances service (use current low-demand estimate) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 17 (sustained ~P17-P37 low weekly demand); pipeline is large (867 in-transit) and on-hand is 0. Confirmed lead time historically matches promised 2 in concluded messages. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (2) for the OR engine. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the recent low-demand regime (reduces replenishment amid a large in-transit position and high holding cost relative to profit). This avoids over-ordering while the pipeline clears and respects recent observed volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 24 (weekly demand mostly single- to double-digits). On-hand=0, in-transit=867 (large pipeline). Past conclude messages confirmed lead time = 2 in earlier windows and multiple lost shipments early; no new sustained lead-time change. I set L=default (use promised 2). For demand I use recent_N over the latest low-demand regime to avoid inflating mu from older high-demand periods: N=15 (Period 24\u201338 regime length \u224815). Same recent_N=15 for sigma to reflect current low-volatility regime. This keeps target base stock aligned to current low demand while the large in-transit pipeline prevents over-ordering.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=867 (large pipeline). Historical conclues confirm lead time = 2 and a sustained demand decline starting Period 17 (lower regime). To avoid overstocking against the large in-transit balance, keep promised lead time. Forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (use recent_N=20 covering Period 20\u201339) so mu_hat reflects current low average; use recent_N=20 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings reduce additional ordering while the sizable pipeline arrives.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=867. Historical carry-overs show a sustained demand decline starting Period 17 (avg ~106) and recent weeks show very low demand (3-5 units). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 in past observations and many early shipments were lost but subsequent arrivals align with L=2. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set L to default (promised 2) and use recent_N methods for demand stats so the OR engine forecasts based on the most recent low-demand periods (N=20) thereby reducing target base-stock and limiting holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels. Sigma uses recent_N (N=20) to capture current low volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=867. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time = 2 periods (e.g., P2\u2192P4) and a sustained demand decline starting Period 17 (documented previously). Recent demand since Period 17 is much lower than earlier regime. To avoid overstock given large in-transit and low recent demand, keep promised lead time (default) but base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. I use recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent stable low-demand periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the latest regime; this reduces target base stock and lowers ordering in presence of large pipeline inventory, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has been in the low-single-digits since Period 17 (sustained downward regime); on-hand=0, in-transit=867 (large pipeline) so do not inflate demand forecast. Use promised lead time (default) since historical concludes confirm L=2 and OR expects promised LT. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-Period-17 low-demand regime and reduce target base_stock; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent low volatility. These choices keep mu_hat and sigma_hat aligned to the sustained low-demand regime and avoid additional ordering given the large in-transit inventory, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent weekly demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 17 (weekly demands mostly <60, many single-digit weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=867 units (large pipeline). Earlier windows showed lost/delayed shipments but lead time has been observed as 2 periods in confirmed concludes; no new sustained lead-time change since. To avoid adding inventory to the large pipeline while reflecting the lower-demand regime, keep L at the promised/default value so the OR engine assumes standard lead time, and use a recent-N estimate for demand (focus on the recent low-demand regime). I choose recent_N with N=20 (captures the sustained low-demand regime from P17 onward, capped at 20). Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current low volatility. These settings steer the OR engine to compute a much smaller mu_hat and sigma_hat (reducing new orders) while relying on the existing large in-transit stock to meet any small remaining demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=867. Historical concludes confirm lead time ~2 for arrived orders and multiple lost/delayed shipments earlier; demand regime collapsed since Period 17 (sustained low weekly demand through Period 44). To avoid overordering into low-demand regime while accounting for in-transit stock, use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N=20 to capture the current low-demand regime (use last 20 samples to reflect the sustained decline). This reduces forecasted (1+L) demand and lowers safety stock, limiting holding cost exposure given large in-transit volume and prior missing shipments.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=867. Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 17 (sustained low weekly demand through Period 45). Many periods with no arrivals since Period 18 despite large in-transit volume, suggesting prolonged missing/delayed shipments; OR engine only knows promised L=2 so keep L default. To align forecasting with the current low-demand regime, set mu_hat based on recent samples (recent_N) to avoid over-ordering against a diminished demand level; use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: 867 units in-transit with no arrivals observed between Period 18 and Period 45 (28 periods); treat these as likely lost/delayed.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent history shows a sustained demand decline beginning Period 17 (P17-P23 avg ~106 vs earlier ~244) and very low weekly demand since; on-hand=0, in-transit=867 but prior carry-over flagged these as likely lost/delayed. I keep L=default (promised 2) because concluded messages historically support lead_time=2 and there is no new concluded arrival to justify changing the observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained low-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean) so mu_hat reflects the downward shift and avoids overstocking. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=20) to estimate volatility from the same recent low-demand window. These choices bias orders low to avoid holding cost on a product with long in-transit uncertainty and persistently low demand.
