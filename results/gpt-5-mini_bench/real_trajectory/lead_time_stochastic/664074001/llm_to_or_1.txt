Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand samples (Jan 7\u2013Feb 4) show mean = (82+52+45+99+108)/5 = 77.2 units/week; no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so coverage must include current period demand plus lead time (L+1 periods). No sustained changepoint or seasonal signal detected. I use promised lead time (default) so the OR backend will compute base_stock using (1+L)\xd7mean demand and standard deviation from all samples, which provides a balanced service level given profit/holding cost ($19 vs $1). This keeps parameters conservative (uses full sample history) until we observe concluded arrivals or a demand shift.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=124 (order placed P1 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time; possible delay but insufficient evidence. Use promised lead time (default) to let OR backend apply its lead-time model. Demand history (five weekly samples Jan\u2013Feb) shows mean ~77.2/week; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding parameters.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean 77.2 and std ~24.98. On-hand=0, in-transit=251 (matches orders 124+127). No concluded arrivals observed yet; this is expected given promised lead time=2 (orders from P1/P2 would only conclude after their arrival is observed). I therefore use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility using all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost by relying on full-sample estimates until we observe sustained changepoints or confirmed late/lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly baseline (Jan) mean=77.2; recent realized demand over Periods 1-3: 105, 188, 143 (mean=145.33), indicating a clear upward demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=426 (sum of P1-P3 orders) and no concluded arrivals by Period 3, so promised L=2 appears too short. I set L explicit=3 to reflect likely longer lead time (orders placed P1-P3 have not concluded). For demand forecast I use recent_N N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime; same recent_N N=3 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the replenishment target to cover the higher short-term demand while accounting for extended lead time and avoid stockouts from overdue shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >2: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (124+127+175=426) have not arrived by Period 3 conclude, suggesting actual lead time >=3; Recent demand regime shift: mean increased from 77.2 (Jan samples) to 145.3 (Periods 1-3), +88%

Daily Reward (R_t): $1873.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent demand elevated vs Jan baseline: Periods1-4 demands = 105,188,143,100 (recent mean ~134 vs historical mean 77.2). On-hand=27, in-transit=513 (ample pipeline; some early orders delayed/lost but P2 arrival confirms L=2 for at least one shipment). I set L by calculating average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed observations. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 4 demand observations) so the OR backend raises base-stock and safety stock to meet elevated demand while excess pipeline limits aggressive ordering.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=513. Observed concluded lead times: one confirmed arrival (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) \u2192 observed lead_time=2; earlier missing arrivals may be lost but not enough evidence to change. Recent demand shows a higher regime vs. Jan samples; use the most recent 3 demand observations (Periods 3-5: 143,100,82) to forecast the (1+L)-period demand horizon (L inferred). Choose L by averaging observed lead times to let backend use confirmed signal. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift demand level while matching the review+lead horizon (1+L=3). This balances service (respond to higher recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand 0, in-transit 513. Observed arrival history: Period 4 conclude shows order from P2 arrived with lead_time=2; earlier P1 order still missing (possible loss) but only one confirmed observed lead time=2, so use calculated average. Demand recent series (Periods1-6): 105,188,143,100,82,95 \u2014 evidence of a recent regime change (early spike P1-3 then moderated P4-6). To balance service vs. holding cost, I use a recent_N forecast over the last 6 samples to capture the full recent volatility while keeping responsiveness; same window for sigma to reflect current variability. These choices let the backend compute base_stock responsive to recent higher mean while sigma captures observed variance; using calculated L ensures lead-time estimate reflects confirmed arrivals rather than promised lead time which may have lost shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent observed concluded arrivals show a lead time of 2 for the Period 2 order, so use calculated average lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=513 but history shows missing arrivals (P1 and P3 orders never concluded) suggesting lost shipments; maintain demand forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 4-7) where demand = [100,82,95,114], mean=97.75. Set L by calculate to let backend use observed lead times. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to focus forecast on the latest 4 realized demand periods (covers review+lead). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to capture recent variability. These choices prioritize matching the backend's base-stock to the recent realized demand while accounting for observed shipment losses by relying on observed lead-time average rather than the promised value.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders from Period 1 (124 units) and Period 3 (175 units) remain unconcluded through Period 7 (total 299 units) \u2014 likely lost shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-08. Recent demand is above historical Jan mean (Jan mean=77.2); last 5 periods (P4\u2013P8) avg demand\u2248112.8, showing a sustained elevated regime versus Jan. On-hand=0, in-transit=513 but multiple early orders remain unconcluded -> risk of lost/delayed shipments. To be conservative on service level given elevated demand and uncertain arrivals, set lead time explicit=3 (longer than promised 2) so mu_hat covers (1+L) review+lead demand using recent data. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent regime (Periods 4\u20138). This increases target base-stock to protect against stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has clearly shifted up from Jan baseline (mean 77.2) to current periods (most recent 9-period mean ~123.6). Concluded arrivals show an observed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4); several earlier orders remain unconcluded suggesting lost shipments, so I will rely on observed lead-time history rather than promised uncertainty. Set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures the confirmed LT=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the elevated recent regime across all available post-launch samples (covers Periods 1\u20139). For sigma I also use recent_N N=9 so the volatility estimate reflects the recent higher-demand regime. These choices bias the base-stock upward to restore service given missing arrivals while keeping variability estimates tied to recent data to avoid overstocking.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): on-hand=0, in-transit=513. Concluded lead-times observed: 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P9->P10) => use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand shows sustained upward regime vs Jan baseline (recent sample mean ~125+); to capture current regime use recent_N over the last 10 observed periods for demand mean and volatility (captures the post-Jan uplift and recent weeks). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat increases forecast to cover elevated demand and buffers variability while the OR engine uses promised L and its caps; this helps mitigate stockouts from past missing shipments while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has shifted up vs Jan baseline: Jan sample mean=77.2 vs recent five-week mean \u2248127 (Periods 8-12: 173,112,122,105,125). On-hand=0, in-transit=513 (large pipeline but multiple delayed/lost shipments observed: orders from P1/P3 remained unconcluded for many periods). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P9\u2192P10) \u21d2 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher recent demand regime (captures latest 5 weeks, N=5 is within 3\u201320 cap). This balances service (higher mean to avoid stockouts) vs holding cost by relying on recent volatility rather than all-time lower Jan mean.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent history shows variable and occasionally delayed/lost arrivals: observed lead times = 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P9\u2192P10); multiple earlier orders never concluded. Demand has risen relative to the Jan baseline; recent 5-period demand (Periods 9\u201313 = 112,122,105,125,93) averages ~111. To balance service vs holding cost given uncertain/shortening observed lead times but risk of lost shipments, I use a short recent-average lead time (recent_N, N=2) to reflect most recent evidence while keeping pipeline coverage modest. I set demand forecast and volatility using the last 5 actual demands (recent_N, N=5) to capture the current elevated regime without over-weighting distant Jan samples. This keeps base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand and avoids excessive orders that would amplify risk if in-transit shipments are lost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=513; history shows inconsistent arrivals (observed lead times: 2 from P2->P4, 1 from P9->P10) and several missing/late shipments earlier, so use observed-average lead time. Demand has clearly shifted up vs. early samples; I use a recent-regime estimate based on the last 11 demand observations (Periods 4-14) to capture the current elevated mean and volatility. These settings make the backend target (1+L)-period coverage using recent demand levels while letting the lead-time estimate reflect realized arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=513 (several earlier orders unconfirmed; evidence of missing/lost shipments). Observed lead times from concl: P4 showed P2\u2192arrived (LT=2), P10 showed P9\u2192arrived (LT=1) \u2192 average LT \u22481.5, so use 'calculate' to let backend average observed L. Recent demand (Periods 4-15) is consistently higher than the Jan baseline; I use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated regime (periods 4\u201315). These settings raise the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility to improve service given large in-transit uncertainty while the OR cap limits over-ordering to control holdings cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): recent weekly demand has been elevated vs Jan samples (recent 8-period mean ~116 vs Jan mean ~77) with demands in Periods 9-16 = [112,122,105,125,93,100,118,139]. On-hand=0, in-transit=513 (large pipeline but several earlier orders showed delayed/variable arrivals). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P9\u2192P10) \u2192 average ~1.5. I set L="calculate" so backend uses the average of observed lead times. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and avoid understocking, I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the last 8 weeks of realized demand. This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by raising target base-stock to meet current demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=0, in-transit=513 \u2014 large pipeline but many past orders (Periods 1 and 3) never concluded, suggesting lost shipments; demand has remained elevated (recent weekly demands: 112,122,105,125,93,100,118,139,203) versus earlier Jan mean ~77. I choose L=calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (we have observed lead times of 2 and 1, so average ~1.5) rather than trusting promised=2 given mixed evidence and missing shipments. For demand and volatility I use default methods so the backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this leverages full sample history while letting L reflect observed lead-time behavior. This balances service (higher mu_hat if L>0) against holding cost and avoids manual over-adjustment given possible lost shipments.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17): recent demand is elevated and volatile (many weekly demands ~100\u2013203). On-hand=0, in-transit=513 which matches outstanding orders from Periods 1,3,4 (124+175+214=513) indicating those shipments are still en route/missing. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P9\u2192P10); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast/volatility on recent weeks and reduce influence of the small Jan sample set.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has risen and been volatile: last 6 weeks demands = [100,118,139,203,194,139], avg\u2248149. On-hand=0, in-transit=513 with multiple overdue/unconcluded early orders \u2192 evidence of delayed/lost shipments and effective lead time longer than promised. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 (anticipate longer/variable lead time). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new higher regime: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 6 = 4*~148.8 \u2248595. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts given pipeline uncertainty while relying on recent demand samples to limit overstating demand and holding costs.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=730 (large pipeline; some earlier orders appear lost but large in-transit stock exists). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1} so use recent average. To reflect the sustained higher demand regime, use recent_N for demand forecasts (captures higher recent mean/volatility) with a moderately long window. These settings balance service (higher mu_hat) while acknowledging pipeline inventory; sigma_hat uses same recent window to size safety stock.

Observed concluded lead times: 2 (Period 4) and 1 (Period 10) \u2014 use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand recently elevated vs. Jan samples (sustained higher weekly demand from Periods 4\u201321); to capture the current regime use recent_N for demand parameters with N=18 (Periods 4\u201321) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher mean and volatility while accounting for review+lead. This balances service (higher target stock for increased demand) against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). On-hand=98, in-transit=513. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P9->P10), and 2 (P20->P22) \u2014 average ~1.67 but with variance and earlier lost shipments (P1,P3) observed. Demand has shifted to a higher regime sustained across many recent periods (weeks with demands often >> Jan baseline). To be robust to the confirmed higher recent demand while letting the OR engine infer lead time from observed history, I set L using the calculated average of observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained elevated mean and volatility in the most recent data (caps N to 20). This balances higher service level for sustained elevated demand while letting the backend cap orders per its policy and holding cost tradeoff.

Recent history shows some concluded lead-times of 2,1,2 (avg ~1.67) and a prior sustained demand upshift earlier; current on-hand=6, in-transit=513 (large pipeline, some earlier missing shipments noted). I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the average of the three observed concluded lead times (captures slight <2 avg). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 demand points (Periods 19-23) because the series exhibits regime shifts and recent weeks better represent current demand. Sigma kept as default so the backend scales volatility using all historical samples while accounting for (1+L). These choices bias the OR engine toward not over-order (large existing pipeline) while using recent demand to set an appropriate base-stock for current conditions and the inferred slightly-lower-than-promised lead time.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand elevated vs Jan baseline; last 5 observed demands (Periods 20-24) = [93,85,119,92,54], mean \u2248 88.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=513 (covers multiple periods). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2} \u2192 average \u22481.67, so use backend 'calculate' to let it average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the most recent regime (captures recent higher demand and variance) so the OR engine sets base stock responsive to current demand while avoiding overweighting old low-Jan samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty and past missing shipments) against holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=513 (backend will treat these as pipeline despite earlier missing shipments). Historical concluded lead times observed = {P4:2, P10:1, P22:2} => average ~1.67; demand has been elevated recently (many weekly demands ~90\u2013203). To balance service vs holding cost: set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed avg lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand to capture the current higher-demand regime. I choose recent_N=12 to cover the most recent ~3 months of weekly demand (captures summer demand surge) so base-stock reflects elevated mean and realized volatility. This helps avoid under-ordering given delayed/lost shipments while not grossly overstating variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent concluded lead times = {2,1,2} (Periods 4,10,22) \u2014 use recent average to reflect observed variability. Recent demand has been elevated and variable since Period ~17; to capture the current regime I use the last 12 demand samples for forecast and volatility.

Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been elevated vs. Jan baseline; on-hand=0, in-transit=513 (large pipeline with some historically missing shipments). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2} \u2192 use averaged observed lead time. To keep responsiveness to the recent summer demand regime, forecast demand using recent observations. Chosen: L by 'calculate' (avg observed lead times) so backend infers ~1.67; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12 to reflect the last ~3 months of higher, more variable demand and to avoid diluting with low-Jan values. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand and a noisy pipeline) against holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than long-run mean.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Demand has shifted up markedly vs. Jan baseline (sustained higher weekly sales through Periods 1\u201328). Pipeline shows 513 in-transit but many past orders experienced delayed/lost arrivals; to be conservative on lead-time risk use observed average lead time. Set L to calculated (avg observed lead times) so backend infers actual recent LT. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the latest 20 demand samples to capture the sustained higher regime while smoothing older low-Jan values. This raises target base stock to improve service given elevated demand; sigma from recent 20 captures current volatility. These parameters balance higher service (profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute z* with profit/holding ratio.

Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P9->P10), 2 (P20->P22) \u2014 suggests average lead time ~1.67. To balance service vs holding cost given uncertain/lost shipments, set L to be computed from observed lead times (calculate).

On-hand = 0, in-transit = 513 \u2014 pipeline large but earlier periods showed missing/lost shipments; use inferred observed lead times rather than promised alone. Set L by averaging observed concluded lead times to reflect realized transport times. For demand, use a recent-window mean (N=20) to capture the elevated recent demand regime across the review+lead period. Keep sigma_hat default so backend scales variability across (1+L). These choices aim to place base-stock near recent demand-driven needs while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit over-ordering given large in-transit inventory and holding cost.

Demand has been elevated vs. Jan baseline; recent windows (summer) show sustained higher weekly demand (~90\u2013203).

Recent demand (Periods 26-33) shows stable mid-high weekly sales (108,91,110,118,86,92,96,136) with mean \u2248104.6. To balance service vs. holding cost given uncertain but slightly <2 mean lead time and recent demand level, I set L to the recent average of the last 3 observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132\u20132 pattern). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 (last 8 demand periods) so the backend bases base-stock on current realized demand rather than older low-Jan samples. These choices aim to provision for (1+L) periods of demand reflecting current demand while avoiding undue extra stock from older low-variance data.

Multiple earlier orders failed to conclude and some shipments may be lost, but concluded evidence supports an average lead time < promised 2. I select L='calculate' to let the backend use the average of observed lead times. Demand history is long and variable; no strong, sustained new demand regime is evident since prior insights, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (full-sample estimates scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to let the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given computed L.

History shows intermittent concluded lead times: observed W = {2 (P2->P4), 1 (P9->P10), 2 (P20->P22)} suggesting average lead time \u22481.67; earlier missing/unconcluded shipments noted but recent observations support a ~1.7 mean. Recent demand (most recent 12 periods: P24\u2013P35 demands = 54,78,108,91,110,118,86,92,96,136,63,63) reflects current regime better than early-year samples. To balance service level vs holding cost, set L based on observed average lead time (calculate) and use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current demand regime, reducing risk from outdated Jan samples and addressing intermittent delivery noise.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand (Periods 32-36 = 96,136,63,63,54) averages ~82; earlier Jan samples similar (~78). On-hand=0, in-transit=513 \u2014 large pipeline but many earlier orders were delayed/lost per history; concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2,1,2 (no sustained shift). I select L by calculating the average of observed lead times (method='calculate') so the OR engine uses actual observed lead-time evidence. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to adapt to the current, lower recent mean versus the early spike; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility. These choices avoid over-ordering against historical spikes while recognizing the large in-transit pipeline (the backend cap will limit orders), and balance service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) by relying on recent demand to set target base stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=513. Historical concludes show observed lead_times = {P4:2 (ordered P2), P10:1 (ordered P9), P22:2 (ordered P20)} \u2192 average observed lead time ~1.67. Many earlier orders never concluded (lost/delayed) but recent concluded observations are 1\u20132 periods. Demand has varied; to be responsive to recent demand levels I use a recent-window demand estimate. Choices: L set via 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time; mu_hat set to recent_N with N=20 to capture the last ~20 weeks of demand (reduces influence of early regime shifts and lost shipments); sigma_hat set to recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters balance service (use recent demand to cover (1+L) periods) while avoiding excessive stock from older high-demand regime and mitigate impact of prior missing shipments by relying on recent realized demand.

Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4 from P2), 1 (P10 from P9), 2 (P22 from P20) \u2192 recent avg ~1.67. No new sustained demand regime shift since prior insights. To reflect actual observed lead-time behavior while remaining robust, set L using recent_N over the last 3 observed lead times. Use default demand forecasting (backend (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR engine applies its established base-stock calculation and cap given the chosen L.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent weekly demand has fallen vs. early-year spike; last 5 concluded weeks (P35-39) avg \u224859 units/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=513 but many past orders remained unconcluded => apparent longer/misaligned lead times and potential lost shipments. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative vs. promised 2 (accounts for observed delayed arrivals/lost shipments). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduced volatility; this keeps target base-stock modest to limit holding cost given large uncertain pipeline. These choices prioritize avoiding excess holding while acknowledging delayed arrivals.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-11-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=513. History shows multiple overdue/missing shipments earlier (Periods 1-3 orders unconcluded through P3 and later), and mixed observed lead times of 1\u20132 when arrivals did occur. Given persistent delivery uncertainty and large pipeline, I explicitly set lead time longer than promised to protect against understock if remaining in-transit arrives late. Demand in recent months (Aug\u2013Nov) is lower than the early-2019 spike; I use recent_N=20 to let the backend weight recent weeks for the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility. This balances higher safety for uncertain arrivals (longer L) with recent lower demand to avoid excessive holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=513. Concluded lead-time observations: Period4 (2), Period10 (1), Period22 (2) \u2192 recent average ~1.67. Recent demand (Periods 39-41) shows 48,34,46 (3 periods) indicating a sustained drop vs earlier months. Because the OR engine uses promised lead time but we have mixed observed LT, use 'calculate' to let backend average observed LT. For demand forecast, emphasize the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overstocking given low observed sales and high in-transit. This balances service vs holding cost with tighter forecast based on most recent data.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline confirmed: Periods 39-41 avg demand=42.7 over 3 periods (48,34,46), sustained 3 weeks; recent demand ~50% below earlier regime averages.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=513. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times and some lost shipments earlier, but concluded arrivals in history still include 1-2 period lead times; no new sustained lead-time confirmation beyond promised L=2. Demand has declined recently \u2014 Periods 39-41 average ~42.7 and Period 42=50; I therefore forecast using the most recent 3 weeks to capture the lowered regime. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (backend known L=2) while using recent_N for demand to reduce target base-stock and limit holding cost given low recent demand. Sigma is set to recent_N (3) to reflect recent lower volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=513 but several historical shipments have been missing/delayed; to be conservative I assume actual lead time > promised and set L explicit=3. To avoid overstocking vs holding cost while matching the recent low-demand regime, I forecast demand using the most recent 3 weeks (recent_N N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the current low mean and volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has declined and stabilized around ~40-60 units/week (Periods 39-44: 48,34,46,50,35,61). On-hand=0, in-transit=513 (large pipeline). Observed lead times from concluded arrivals: 2 (P4), 1 (P10), 2 (P22) \u2192 average ~1.67; use calculate to let backend compute average observed lead time. To reflect the recent lower demand regime I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures most recent 3 weeks: Periods 42-44) so base_stock targets lower demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19. This balances service level against holding cost while acknowledging pipeline inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=513 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times observed = {2,1,2} (avg ~1.67) but promised=2 and evidence of earlier lost shipments is mixed; no new sustained lead-time shift since last concluded arrivals. Recent demand shows a sustained lower regime starting around Period 39 (Periods 39-45 = 48,34,46,50,35,61,102 \u2014 mostly low with a late spike in P45 likely holiday noise). I therefore keep L at default (promised lead time=2) and base demand forecast on the most recent regime using recent_N over the last 7 periods (regime length = 7) to capture the lower recent mean while allowing the OR engine to compute base_stock. I also use recent_N (N=7) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (capture recent lower demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Historical concluded lead times observed: 2 (P2->P4), 1 (P9->P10), 2 (P20->P22) \u2192 average ~1.67, so actual lead time appears slightly < promised 2 but variable. Demand has been in a lower regime since Periods 39-41 (avg ~43) and no new sustained shift since. Large in-transit quantity (513) likely covers multiple periods of demand; use calculated L to reflect observed variability and let backend compute mu_hat/sigma_hat from full sample means to avoid overreacting to recent noise. This balances service (avoid stockouts if some in-transit arrive late) against holding costs given holding=$1 and profit=$19.
