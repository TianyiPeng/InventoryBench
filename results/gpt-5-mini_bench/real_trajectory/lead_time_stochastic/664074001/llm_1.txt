Demand analysis: recent demands (P39-46) = [48,34,46,50,35,61,102,82], recent average \u224857 units/week with volatility; no sustained new regime since prior confirmed uptick (P15-17). Lead-time & pipeline: historical arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133), and earlier periods flagged pipeline unreliability; large in-transit=2310 may include late arrivals but given past shipment variability we cannot assume all will be lost. Inventory assessment: on-hand=24, in-transit=2310 (uncertain). Ordering decision balances risk of creating excessive holding cost at $1/unit/period vs. stockouts. Given substantial in-transit inventory (even if partially delayed) and moderate recent demand (~57/wk), I avoid increasing exposure to holding cost before observing which in-transit units conclude. Final action: place no new order this period and wait for confirmable arrivals next period to update lead-time/pipeline assessment.",
