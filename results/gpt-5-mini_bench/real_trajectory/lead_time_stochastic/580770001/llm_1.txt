  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (Christmas week) which can boost apparel demand, but recent Dec demand has been very low (Periods 43\u201345: 5,4,2 => avg ~3.7/week). Product: womens jumper is seasonal for colder months but demand evidence now is low. Demand forecast: use recent regime (Dec) avg \u22483.7 units/week; with promised lead_time=2, cover L+1=3 weeks \u2192 target on-hand \u224811 units. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=50 > target; in-transit=512 is large and partly unreliable per prior carry-over notes (overdue/lost shipments historically). Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit $1/unit, so excess inventory is very costly. Order logic: do not place additional orders this period to avoid incurring holding cost and risking oversupply; reassess when on-hand approaches target or confirmed arrivals change.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas week); demand for womens knitwear is typically depressed this week. Demand analysis: recent observed weekly demand has fallen to very low levels (Periods 43\u201346: 5,4,2,1) after earlier seasonal spikes in Sep; no evidence of a new upward regime. Lead time / missing orders: historical arrivals show variable lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods) but no new sustained change; treat in-transit as potentially unreliable at times but many past orders have eventually arrived. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=49, in-transit=512 \u2014 pipeline is very large relative to recent demand (512 units would cover many weeks even at elevated demand). Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit per unit, so extra inventory is very costly. Final order logic: do not place additional replenishment now; consume pipeline and avoid further holding cost until demand signal strengthens or pipeline reduces.",
