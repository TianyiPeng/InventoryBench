Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals yet. Historical weekly demand samples (5): 13,5,15,28,31 (mean=18.4). Promised lead time=2. No evidence of changepoint or lost shipments. Use default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so OR backend computes base_stock consistent with long-run sample stats and the promised L, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=37 (ordered in Period 1) and Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 so the P1 order has not yet arrived; with promised lead time=2 and only one conclude message available we cannot confirm an actual lead-time change or lost shipment. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show moderate demand (mean ~18.4). I therefore keep L at the promised/default to avoid premature lead-time adjustment, and use default demand estimates (which compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples). This balances service (uses full sample mean over the review+lead window) against holding cost given existing in-transit stock and no confirmed delays.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=80 (outstanding orders from prior periods). Period1 and Period2 conclude show ordered but no arrivals yet \u2014 this is expected given the promised lead time=2 (no concluded arrivals should be visible yet for those orders). No sustained demand or lead-time changepoint evident in the short history (historical weekly demand samples: 13,5,15,28,31). Using default promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimators lets the OR engine compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L), balancing service vs holding cost without overreacting to inconclusive early non-arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand has surged (Periods 1-3 demands = 39, 53, 66) vs historical samples (13,5,15,28,31). On-hand=0, in-transit=127 (sum of P1-P3 orders) but none have concluded as arrived in three consecutive conclude messages \u2014 indicating shipments are overdue or lost. To be conservative, set lead time explicitly to 3 periods to buffer against further delays. For demand, use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (three sustained high-demand periods). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These parameters increase base-stock to meet elevated demand while recognizing holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (37, 43, 47 = 127 units) have not arrived in any conclude message; likely lost or lead time > promised 2 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $817.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-11. Recent realized demand is much higher than the older Jan samples (recent demands: 39, 53, 66, 52). There is one observed lead-time sample showing 2 periods (order from P2 arrived in P4) but some earlier orders remain missing\u2014so I keep the lead-time estimator data-driven. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history (captures the observed 2-period sample). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (the four most recent demand observations) to capture the clear upward regime vs. the older January series. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 to reflect current demand volatility. These choices bias ordering toward meeting the elevated recent demand while the backend's capped policy limits excessive orders in case some shipments remain lost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=189 (outstanding orders total). Historical weekly mean (given samples) = 18.4 units. Recent realized demand for Periods 1-5 = [39,53,66,52,26], recent mean = 47.2 \u2014 a sustained uptick over 5 periods. One concluded arrival shows promised lead time=2 was honored (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Some earlier orders were delayed but all outstanding units are still in-transit (189). To capture the sustained demand regime shift I set L=default (use promised 2), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new higher demand across the review+lead window, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture increased recent volatility. These parameters nudge the OR backend to raise base-stock to meet the new demand while using observed lead-time promise to avoid over-correcting for lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: avg increased from 18.4 (historical samples) to 47.2 (Periods 1-5, 2019-02-11 to 2019-03-11), +156%

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand regime is elevated (Periods 1-5 avg ~47.2 vs historical ~18.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=159 but several early orders (Periods 1 and 3) never concluded \u2192 evidence of missing/lost shipments; observed lead times are inconsistent (Period2 order LT=2, Period5 order LT=1). I set L by averaging the two observed lead times to reflect current uncertainty but lean on recent observations. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use the most recent 5 periods to capture the new higher-demand regime (N=5 per detected regime length=5). These choices increase target base stock to meet the sustained higher demand while using recent variability to avoid extreme overstock given missing shipment risk.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent history shows elevated demand (Periods 1-5 avg = 47.2) versus older baseline; observed lead times from concluded messages are 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6), suggesting variable lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=188 (covers multiple periods). To capture the observed shorter/variable lead time use calculate for L (avg of observed lead times = 1.5). For demand I use a recent_N=5 sample window to reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime (N=5 chosen as the detected regime length), and match sigma to the same recent window so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend raise base stock to meet the new demand while keeping holding cost in check via recent volatility estimate.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand regime is higher: last 5 period demands = [39,53,66,52,26], mean=47.2 (up from historical ~18.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=159 \u2014 pipeline is large but some earlier orders were delayed/lost; expect near-term demand to remain at the elevated regime. Set L by calculating average of observed lead times (observed concludes: 2,1,1) to let backend adapt to actual speed. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new high-demand regime (covers review+lead period). This raises base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma from recent data captures current volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand elevated ~50 units/week (last 5 demands: 26,46,52,53,52; mean ~45.8) vs historical mean ~18.4 \u2014 sustainment observed since Periods 1-5. Pipeline shows 170 in-transit and on-hand 0; several earlier orders experienced delays/losses but concluded arrivals indicate actual observed lead times vary (1\u20132 periods). I select L="calculate" so backend uses observed lead-time average (captures realized 1,1,2 samples). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor mu_hat to the latest high-demand regime across the review+lead horizon. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping variability estimates tied to recent data to avoid over/under-stocking given mixed delivery reliability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has risen sharply since Period 6 (sustained higher weekly sales, recent 5-period mean >> historical). On-hand=0, in-transit=159 (covers some future demand but prior missing shipments noted early periods). Observed concluded lead times (P4:2, P6:1, P8:1, P10:1) suggest actual lead time shorter than promised but with one 2-period observation; use recent average of last 4 observed lead times to be adaptive. For demand forecast, use recent 5-period data (captures post-changepoint higher regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock reflects elevated demand while limiting excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (avg \u224847.2) and recent concluded lead times are shorter than promised (observed lead_times = [2,1,1,1]). On-hand=0, in-transit=236 (covers multiple periods). I set L using recent observed lead times to reflect the faster actual arrivals (average of last 4 observed). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6-11, N=6) so mu_hat reflects the sustained higher demand. Sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices reduce stockouts under the new demand while avoiding excess holding by using recent evidence-driven estimates.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent demand has stepped up (recent 5-period demands = 53,52,95,64,95; mean ~71.8) and several recent shipments have arrived with 1-period lead time (orders placed in P5,P7,P9 arrived in next period). On-hand=0, in-transit=236 \u2014 pipeline is large but some past shipments were missing; given recent arrivals mostly show L=1, I set L based on recent observed lead times. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new higher-demand regime (focus on last 5 periods) so the OR base-stock will target higher service while avoiding excessive overstocking from very old low-demand samples. Sigma uses recent volatility to size safety stock appropriately.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has risen sharply (recent 5-period demands: 52,95,64,95,93 \u2192 mean 79.8) vs historical mean ~18.4; use a recent-window forecast. Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P8:1, P10:1, P13:2} \u2192 average 1.4, so use recent_N to reflect sub-2 lead-time behavior. On-hand=0, in-transit=201 (includes earlier missing shipments); choosing recent_N=5 for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat lets the OR engine target (1+L)-period demand using the latest high-demand regime while moderating risk from volatile arrivals.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent concluded lead times = [2,1,1,1,2] -> average ~1.4; promised=2 but observed shorter and variable. Recent demand has risen sharply; last 5 realized demands = [95,64,95,93,118], indicating a new high-demand regime. I set L using recent_N=5 to reflect observed lead-time behavior (shorter than promised) so the OR engine forecasts over the empirically observed pipeline. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (higher mean and volatility), which raises the base-stock and safety stock to avoid lost sales while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Demand has been consistently high since Period 6 (sustained regime); recent observed demands (Periods 6-15) are large and many periods show full demand values despite stockouts. Concluded lead-time observations show mixed 1\u20132 periods (recent three concluded lead times = 1,1,2 \u2192 avg ~1.33), so I use a short recent average. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use last 10 demand samples for forecast and volatility). This balances higher target base-stock for service against low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19), and accounts for in-transit inventory (334) when backend computes order. No new confirmed lost-shipment pattern since prior insights.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent demand has been well above historical (many weeks 50\u2013118) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 6. On-hand=0, in-transit=334 (pipeline substantial but some earlier orders were missing/lost). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,1,2} \u2192 avg ~1.4, so use backend 'calculate' to let it compute the average observed lead time. Use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6\u201316, regime length \u224811). This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand while sigma estimated from the same recent window balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has shifted materially upward (multiple weeks with demand 63\u2013118); on-hand=0, in-transit=298 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,1,1,2,2,1] \u2192 average \u22481.43 periods, so use calculate to let backend set L to observed-average. Demand forecast uses most recent regime: last 5 realized weekly demands (Periods 15\u201319) show high demand (mean \u224882.2), so use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility. This raises base_stock to meet elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline mitigates short-term stockouts; using recent_N reduces understock risk given the sustained high-demands and known past missing shipments.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods (multiple recent observations of 1 and 2); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime since early periods (sustained high weekly demand through Periods 6\u201320); use recent_N for demand and volatility to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (N=15 covers the post-shift window and balances responsiveness vs. sample size). This increases mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma_hat reflects recent variability, helping the OR engine set a higher base stock for service without overreacting to older low-demand samples. In-transit=300 provides coverage but may include late/lost shipments; parameters rely on observed concluded arrivals via calculate and recent_N to adapt.

Date 2019-07-08. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (sustained elevated weekly demand ~46\u2013118). On-hand=0, in-transit=300 (large pipeline likely covers upcoming demand but some prior orders were delayed/lost historically). Use lead-time estimate from observed concluded lead times (mixture of 1\u20132, avg\u22481.43) to reflect faster-than-promised arrivals. For demand forecast use recent sample regime to capture the sustained increase: use recent_N on demand (covering the post-shift regime) so base_stock responds to higher mean and variance. Use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices increase service level during the sustained high-demand regime while keeping holding cost measured by using observed lead time rather than the promised 2.

LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-07-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=298. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (observed W = [2,1,1,1,2,2,1,2], avg 1.5), so set L using calculate to capture average observed lead time. Demand has been consistently high in recent weeks (recent concluded demands: P15-P22 and P14-P21 show elevated values); to adapt to the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to weight the latest demand behavior (N=8 balances recency and sample size). These parameters push the OR backend to raise the base-stock covering the longer, higher-demand regime while the sigma estimate from recent data ensures safety stock for observed volatility. Missing shipments earlier remain a risk but are already reflected in concluded lead-time observations and the large in-transit quantity; no new sustained pattern beyond previously recorded insights.

To balance high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), use an inferred lead time (calculate) to capture observed 1\u20132 period behaviour, and base demand forecast on recent data (last 8 weeks) to reflect the sustained higher demand. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility.

Demand has shifted upward and remained elevated through recent periods (many weeks with demand 50\u2013118). To capture true lead-time behavior I use calculate (average of observed lead times).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. On-hand=0, in-transit=298 (large pipeline from prior orders). Observed concluded lead times recent sequence = {P17:2, P19:1, P22:2} so I use recent_N for L to capture current mix of 1-2 period arrivals (N=3). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (sustained elevated weekly demand); to reflect the long-lasting shift I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility over the last 20 demand samples (captures the post-shift regime). These choices let the OR backend size base-stock to meet (1+L) periods of elevated demand while using recent volatility to set safety stock, and they account for the large in-transit volume so we avoid over-ordering.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12. Recent demand is well above the early historical sample (sustained high weekly demand from Period 6 onward). On-hand=0, in-transit=298 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times average ~1.5 (mix of 1 and 2). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set lead time to the empiric average (calculate) and use recent demand stats over the last 20 concluded periods to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand under the current regime while accounting for recent volatility. This balances service (reduce stockouts given high demand) against holding costs given substantial in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. On-hand=0, in-transit=298 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (several confirmed 1s and 2s); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (sustained higher weekly demand through Period 27); use recent_N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime for both mean and volatility. This raises mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent data captures current variability. Large in-transit reduces needed ordering but we rely on backend capping; these choices balance service-level (high profit per unit) against holding cost by forecasting with recent high-demand samples and using observed lead-time average.

Observed concluded lead times: 2,1,1,1,2,2,1,2 -> avg=1.5; use calculated L to reflect realized variability. Demand regime shift detected earlier (higher demand since Period 6) is still in effect; use recent demand window to capture new higher mean/variance. Therefore: L by calculate (average observed lead times); mu_hat recent_N and sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to force the OR engine to size base-stock for the higher recent demand while accounting for pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-09-02. Recent demand is much higher than the historical 2019-Jan baseline (carry-over insight: demand regime shift noted at Period 6; avg increased from 18.4 to ~47.2). Many earlier shipments were delayed/lost but current in-transit = 298 units; arrivals have shown mixed lead times (1 or 2). To capture the sustained higher demand regime I use recent data for demand estimates (reduce stockouts). For lead time I use an empirical average of observed concluded lead times to reflect variability between 1\u20132 periods and avoid overcommitting inventory against possibly lost shipments.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=298; historical concludes show intermittent 1\u20132 period lead times and several lost/very-delayed shipments (Periods 1\u20133 orders never arrived). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (sustained higher weekly demand). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent demand stats to forecast across the review+lead horizon while keeping promised lead time for OR engine consistency. Using recent_N (N=20) captures the post-changepoint demand pattern (Period 6 onward, capped to 20 samples). Same recent window for volatility ensures service-level sizing against recent variability. No new carry-over insights to add.

Date 2019/09/16. Recent realized demand has been high (many weeks 50\u2013118, last four weeks 98,102) and on-hand=0 but large in-transit=298. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime change beyond previously recorded insights. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend uses its estimated L=2; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps parameters aligned with long-run sample stats while relying on the large in-transit pipeline to cover imminent demand and avoids overfitting to short noisy weeks.

Demand has been high and relatively stable in recent weeks (~68\u2013102), so I focus the demand forecast on recent data. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times to reflect actual behavior. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (protecting service level while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. Demand has been elevated and volatile since the regime shift identified around Period 6 (sustained higher weekly demand vs earlier samples). Pipeline shows 298 in-transit but many past orders went missing/delayed, so do not trust single past promised arrival; use observed lead-time history. Set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed concluded lead times (captures mix of 1\u20132 period realizations). For demand (mu_hat) and variability (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-week noise. This increases target base-stock to improve service under the new regime while keeping variability estimation recent to control safety stock and holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent weekly demand remains elevated (many weeks 70-167) versus historical early-2019 samples; on-hand=0 but large pipeline in-transit=333 likely to cover upcoming demand. Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 or 2 periods); I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures recent 1/2-period mix). To anchor demand to current high regime, I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the most recent 20 samples rather than long-ago low-demand weeks. This balances higher service needs from elevated demand while letting the large in-transit pipeline and capped ordering limit holding exposure given low holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14. On-hand=0, in-transit=334. Historical conclude messages show lead times of 1\u20132 periods with some earlier missing shipments; no new sustained lead-time change since prior insight. Recent demand is substantially higher than the early 2019 samples (recent 5 concluded demands ~102,92,167,123,77 \u2192 avg ~112). To capture the current high-demand regime and reduce stockouts given a 2-period promised lead time, keep L at the promised value and estimate demand using the most recent 5 weeks. Thus: L=default so backend uses promised lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean reflecting current regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma based on recent variance avoids underestimating uncertainty.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=0, in-transit=436 \u2014 substantial pipeline but earlier periods showed missing shipments (Periods 1-3) while later arrivals display mixed lead times (1\u20132). Observed concluded lead times average ~1.44 periods, so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has stayed high in recent months (many weeks with demand >> historical early-sample mean), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent regime (captures latest demand level and volatility). This balances higher service needs against low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19) by sizing base stock from recent elevated demand while controlling pipeline cap via the backend.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. Recent demand has been well above early-sample levels (sustained regime shift noted in history). On-hand=0, in-transit=436 (large pipeline but many past orders were delayed/lost earlier). Observed concluded lead times vary (mostly 1-2); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N (capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime) with N=20 to focus the forecast on the most recent 20 periods. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat from recent high demand) while sigma_hat and backend cap limit orders to control holding costs given high in-transit inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concluded lead times (most recent 9 arrivals) average ~1.44; recent demand has shifted to a higher regime (last 9 demands mean \u2248112.6 vs earlier lower periods). To capture shorter-than-promised arrivals while reacting to the sustained demand increase, I set L via recent_N (N=9) to reflect observed lead-time behavior, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=9) to base the review+lead demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime. This balances service (higher target stock for elevated demand) against holding cost while acknowledging in-transit stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11. Demand has been elevated recently (several weeks >90) and observed lead times have been variable, including a recent 3-period arrival (order P36 arrived P39). Current on-hand=7, in-transit=333 (pipeline large). To capture recent high-demand regime and recent lead-time variability I use recent_N=5 for L and demand estimates so the backend bases base-stock on the most recent 5 observations. sigma_hat also uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=391 (large pipeline) and recent demands are materially higher than early historical samples (sustained high weekly demand since Period 6). Observed concluded lead times vary (samples: 2,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,3 \u2192 avg=1.6). To capture true service-delay risk I choose L='calculate' (use average observed lead time). Demand regime shifted up substantially starting Period 6; use recent data to forecast demand across review+lead period: set mu_hat to recent_N with N=20 to focus on the high-demand regime. Volatility also changed with the regime, so set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent variability. These choices reduce stockouts under higher demand while keeping safety stock aligned to recent variance; using observed lead-time average aligns ordering cadence to actual arrival behavior and avoids under-ordering from an optimistic promised lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=391. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed W = {2,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,3} \u2192 avg ~1.67) and some lost/very-delayed shipments earlier, so use an inferred average lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 6 (sustained high weekly demand through recent periods); to capture recent elevated mean/volatility I use recent-window estimates (longest stable recent window capped at 20). These choices (L=calculate; mu_hat and sigma_hat = recent_N with N=20) bias the base-stock toward meeting the sustained higher demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock from recent volatility and the inferred lead time. This accounts for overdue/lost shipments by using observed lead-time average rather than the promised value.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand has moved to a much higher regime (many weeks of 90\u2013167+ units since Period 33). Pipeline is large (in-transit=391) and on-hand=0. Lead times observed recently vary (1\u20133 periods) with occasional 3-period arrival; to be robust I use a short recent average for lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent-N forecasts for mu_hat and sigma_hat (use last 10 demand observations) so the base_stock reflects recent elevated demand while sigma uses same window to size safety. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-12-09. Recent demand has been elevated (recent observed demands ~96,108,106,115,50). On-hand=8, in-transit=364 (large pipeline available). Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133 periods) with more recent 3-period arrivals. To reflect recent variability and elevated demand, I use recent_N for lead time and demand estimates (N=5) so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand estimated from the latest regime and captures recent volatility. This keeps service levels high given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while avoiding understock from underestimating lead time or mean demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=364 (large pipeline) so avoid new aggressive ordering. Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) show variability with measured values {2,1,1,1,2,2,1,2,1,3,3} \u2192 mean \u22481.73; I choose to let backend compute the average observed lead time (calculate). Demand has been in a higher regime since early periods (carry-over noted) so I use recent demand statistics to reflect the elevated mean/volatility: use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime while respecting the large in-transit stock. These parameters bias the base-stock toward higher service for elevated demand but the OR cap and existing pipeline (364 units) will limit new orders and control holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, In-transit=343. Historical conclude messages show variable actual lead times (1\u20133 periods) and multiple delayed/lost shipments earlier; demand has stepped up in recent months (many weekly demands ~80\u2013160). To capture current elevated regime and recent lead-time behaviour I select: L by "calculate" to use the empirical average of observed lead times; mu_hat as "recent_N" with N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent 20 weeks (captures Sept\u2013Dec spike); sigma_hat as "recent_N" with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting high recent demand while the OR backend will cap orders to limit excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent history shows a sustained higher demand regime versus original samples (historical mean 18.4); observed demands and provided carry-over note indicate mean demand rose ~+156%. On-hand=0, in-transit=381 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed lead times \u22481.75. To respond to the higher recent demand while accounting for variable lead time and substantial pipeline, I set L to be estimated from observed lead times (calculate). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime and avoid diluting with older low-demand samples. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects current variability. These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand (raising mu_hat) while using the pipeline and a calculated L to avoid over-ordering and high holding costs.
