  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (late Dec/holiday) \u2014 historically low demand in Dec for this trouser SKU. Demand analysis: recent 6-week demands (P41\u2013P46) = [3,17,2,5,6,6], avg \u2248 6.5 units/week. Use recent low regime (Period 34 onward) as primary forecast. Lead time / pipeline: 385 units currently in-transit; past history shows variable actual lead times and some 3-period arrivals, so treat in-transit as likely to arrive but timing uncertain. Inventory assessment: on-hand 0, in-transit vastly exceeds near-term demand (385 >> expected 3-period demand \u2248 21). Holding vs profit: profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 avoid additional holding cost since pipeline is heavy. Order decision: place no order this period and absorb arrivals when they conclude.",
