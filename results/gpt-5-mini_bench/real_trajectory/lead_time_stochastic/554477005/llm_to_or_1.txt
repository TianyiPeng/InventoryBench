Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) mean=22 units/week; no concluded arrivals so no evidence to change promised lead time (promised L=2). High profit vs holding (q\u22480.95) warrants stocking for (1+L) review+lead period. I use default lead time and default demand statistics to let the OR engine compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples; this balances high service level needs against holding cost given limited history and no signs of lost/delayed shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand samples (weekly): 2019-01-07:20, 2019-01-14:26, 2019-01-21:22, 2019-01-28:27, 2019-02-04:15, Period1 demand 2019-02-11:19. On-hand=0, in-transit=30 (ordered in P1, arrived=0 at P1 conclude) \u2014 consistent with promised lead time=2 (arrival expected in Period 3), no confirmed lost shipments. I use the backend defaults: keep promised lead time so OR uses L=2; use overall-sample mean to form (1+L)*mean demand (captures full review+lead demand without overreacting to a single low recent week); use overall-sample std scaled for sqrt(1+L) for volatility. This balances service level (using multi-week mean) against holding cost given holding_cost is small ($1) vs profit ($19).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent realized weekly demand samples (from history) average ~22 units/week. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 59 (orders from P1 and P2) but no concluded arrivals yet; delays observed but insufficient concluded evidence to change lead time. Use promised lead time (default) so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat. This keeps forecast anchored to full-sample historical demand while the outstanding pipeline is monitored for arrival confirmation.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Historical weekly mean demand = 22 (samples: 20,26,22,27,15). On-hand=0, in-transit=97 (orders: 30+29+38). Promised L=2 but no arrivals observed for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (all arrived=0), indicating actual lead time is longer or shipments lost. To avoid stockouts I set L explicitly to 3 (conservative extension), keep mu_hat default so backend uses (1+L)*mean demand, and keep sigma_hat default for volatility. This raises target base-stock to cover (L+1) periods of demand given delayed arrivals while balancing holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >2 periods: orders placed P1=30, P2=29, P3=38 all show arrived=0 in their conclude messages (no arrivals after promised 2-period lead time).

Daily Reward (R_t): $511.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Historical weekly demand samples mean=22, std\u22484.34. On-hand=2, in-transit=109; several past orders were delayed but Period 4 conclude shows one arrival (P2\u2192arrived, lead_time=2). Using only concluded lead-time data, average observed lead time=2. I choose L via 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times. For demand I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures full review+lead demand with all history). For volatility I use 'default' so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1 implies high target fill) while avoiding overreaction to recent mixed/delayed arrivals and preserving pipeline coverage given 109 in-transit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=109. Historical weekly samples (Jan-Feb) avg=22, but recent periods P1-P5 demand = {19,41,41,27,32} avg=32, a sustained higher-demand regime. Concluded arrivals show at least one order with lead_time=2 (no consistent evidence to change promised lead time), so choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To capture the recent, sustained demand increase I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples) so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock and appropriately wider uncertainty. This balances higher service level against low holding cost ($1) and large profit ($19) per unit, while recognizing some shipments may be delayed/lost (we keep pipeline awareness via concluded messages).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: recent periods P1-P5 avg demand=32 vs historical sample avg=22 (+45%), sustained over 5 periods

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent history shows a sustained demand increase (Period1-5 avg \u224832 vs historical sample mean 22) and large in-transit volume (123 units) with mixed late/missing arrivals earlier. Use calculated lead time from observed concludes to let backend infer average observed LT (one confirmed observe = 2). For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the confirmed recent higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize service during the sustained demand uplift while relying on backend LT calc rather than the promised LT.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history shows multiple overdue/no-arrival events for orders placed in P1\u2013P3 and later arrivals inconsistent with promised L=2 \u2192 evidence of longer actual lead time / lost shipments. Demand has shifted up: last 5 concluded period demands (P3\u2013P7) average ~32 vs historical sample mean 22 (+45%), sustained over 5 periods. To guard against delayed arrivals I set L explicitly to 3. To capture the new higher demand regime I use recent_N, N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, aligning safety stock to the recent higher mean and volatility while capping orders via the backend cap to balance holding cost vs service level.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >2 periods: orders placed P1,P2,P3 showed no arrivals at their conclude messages and later P2 order arrived only at P4 conclude (evidence of delays/lost shipments); Demand regime shift confirmed: recent periods P3\u2013P7 average demand \u224832 vs historical sample avg 22 (+45%), sustained 5 periods

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=164; recent demand has clearly shifted up (~32/week over last 5 concluded weeks vs historical mean 22). Lead times have been variable with multi-period delays earlier but recent observed lead times (from concluded arrivals) are {P2:2, P6:2, P7:1}; I use a short recent average to capture current effective lead time while being robust to prior delays. Set L via recent_N (N=3) to reflect the last 3 observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) because a sustained regime shift over the last 5 periods raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased variability in the recent regime. These choices bias the base-stock up to meet higher demand while keeping holding cost in check given profit/holding ratio.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent history shows a clear, sustained demand uplift (recent periods averaging ~32+ vs historical ~22) and multiple delayed arrivals (orders placed in early periods showed late or missing arrivals). To be conservative against observed delays I set lead time explicit=3 (longer than promised 2). For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the elevated recent regime (uses last 5 demand samples). I also set sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet higher demand and buffer against observed delivery delays while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=205. Recent demand has risen sharply: P6\u2013P10 demands = [36,53,85,77,129], indicating a new high-demand regime. Observed concluded lead-times (from conclude messages): P2\u2192P4=2, P6\u2192P8=2, P7\u2192P8=1, P8\u2192P10=2, P9\u2192P10=1 (avg \u22481.6 over 5 observations). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empiric average observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to force the OR engine to size base-stock for the current high-demand regime (covers review+lead demand using the last 5 periods). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased variability. These choices prioritize service during the sustained demand spike while the calculated L captures the slightly >1 average lead time observed despite earlier delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods P6\u2013P10 avg demand=76 vs historical sample avg=22 (+245%), sustained 5 periods; Observed lead time average \u22481.6 (5 concluded observations: 2,2,1,2,1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand has jumped well above historical samples: P6\u2013P10 avg \u224876 (vs historical 22), with P11=184 showing further spike; use a recent demand window to capture the new regime. Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2,1} \u2192 average \u22481.6; use calculate so backend sets L to observed average. On-hand=0, in-transit=329 (large pipeline) \u2014 must set mu_hat using recent high-demand samples (to cover (1+L) periods) while sigma_hat from same recent window to reflect increased variability. Chosen methods balance service (capture elevated mean) against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than long-run historical low mean.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward (multiple periods with very high sales: P6\u2013P12) while observed lead times (from concluded messages) average ~1.6 (observed lead times: 2,2,1,2,1). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=465 (large pipeline). Because lead time observations exist, use the calculated average lead time so the OR engine accounts for realized delivery timing. Demand forecasting should rely on the most recent high-demand regime (use the last 7 observed demand periods to capture recent surge including P6\u2013P12) for both mean and volatility to avoid under-ordering. Thus: L set to calculate (backend average of observed lead times); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime and increased variability. This balances higher service level (meet surged demand) vs holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-13 (P14). Recent concluded history shows large, sustained demand increase: last 5 demands (P9\u2013P13) = [77,129,184,111,79], avg\u2248116 vs historical sample mean 22 (+~430%). Lead times observed in concludes are mainly 1\u20132 (recent concluded lead_times: 2,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg\u22481.6). On-hand=45, in-transit=341 (total pipeline=386) \u2014 ample pipeline stock, so avoid aggressive new orders. Therefore: set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed-average lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 5 concluded demand samples). This balances higher forecasted demand (to meet service level) against holding cost given large existing pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20. Recent demand has moved sharply higher: Periods 6\u201314 show sustained elevated demand (e.g. P10\u2013P14 demands 129,184,111,79,83; recent regime avg \u2248117). Current inventory: on-hand=98, in-transit=293 (pipeline large vs recent demand). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods (historical avg \u22481.6). To capture the sustained higher demand I use recent_N for demand estimates (N=9 covers P6\u2013P14 regime). For lead time I let the system calculate average observed lead time from concluded messages. Sigma uses recent_N (N=9) to reflect current volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward to meet the new higher demand while relying on the backend cap to limit over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead-time observations in conclude messages are mixed but cluster around 2 periods; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods so the base-stock targets reflect the sustained elevated demand while sigma uses recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts against high demand) vs holding cost by relying on recent data rather than long-run low-demand history.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=468. Recent demand has jumped and remained high: Periods 11\u201316 demands = [184,111,79,83,122,172], recent avg \u2248125.2 vs historical sample mean 22 (+~468%). Lead-time observations (concluded arrivals) = [2,2,1,2,1,2,2], avg \u22481.71. Some recent orders (P15,P16) show zero arrivals so variability/delays persist but concluded data support a shorter-than-promised average. Choose L by calculating observed lead time average to reflect realized delivery behavior; set demand estimate using recent sample (most recent 6 periods) to capture the new high-demand regime; set sigma using recent 6 periods to capture current volatility. These settings direct the OR backend to raise base-stock to meet the sustained elevated demand while using observed lead-time to avoid overestimating pipeline delay risk. 

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods P11\u2013P16 avg demand=125.2 vs historical sample avg=22 (+468%), sustained 6 periods; Observed lead time average from concluded arrivals \u22481.71 (samples: 2,2,1,2,1,2,2).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 P18. On-hand=0, in-transit=327. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 11 (P11\u2013P16 avg \u2248125, P17 demand=185) and observed concluded lead times cluster around ~1.7 periods (samples: 2,2,1,2,1,2,2). To capture the recent demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent 7 concluded periods (P11\u2013P17) to reflect the elevated mean and variability. For lead time I use calculate to let the backend average observed concluded lead times (best unbiased estimate from concluded arrivals). These choices ensure mu_hat scales (1+L) by recent higher mean demand so orders plus pipeline cover the elevated demand; recent sigma captures increased variability to set an appropriate safety stock. Pipeline (327) is large but using recent demand ensures OR will moderate ordering vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 11\u201316 avg \u2248125 units) and concluded arrivals give an empirical lead-time ~1.67.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has been materially higher than historical samples: Periods 14\u201319 demands = [83,122,172,185,140,219] (avg \u2248 153), confirming the sustained high-demand regime since P11\u2013P16. On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (large pipeline) but arrivals are observed with variable lead times (concluded arrivals show mostly 1\u20132 periods). To capture the observed lead-time distribution without over-penalizing, set L to be calculated from concluded lead times (backend will average observed W). For demand, use recent_N over the most recent 6 periods to reflect the new high-demand regime (N=6 is chosen because the recent regime length is \u22656 and provides recent evidence). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These settings push the OR base-stock toward meeting the much higher demand while using the observed lead-time estimate; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency but the high recent mean justifies replenishment to avoid stockouts and lost profit given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Recent demand has been very high and volatile (Periods 16\u201320 demands = 172,185,140,219,220; recent 5-period avg \u2248187). On-hand=0, in-transit=561 (pipeline large but arrivals have been erratic historically). Observed concluded lead-times cluster around ~1.6\u20131.8; promised =2 but shipments have sometimes arrived in 1\u20132 periods or been delayed. To hedge high recent demand while limiting holding cost, I set lead time explicitly to my best estimate (1.7). For demand forecast and volatility I use the most recent 5 periods (recent_N=5) to capture the large regime shift and higher variance so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using those samples. This balances service-level for the current high-demand regime against holding cost given a large in-transit position and uncertain arrivals.

On-hand=0, in-transit=597 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals have variable lead times historically. Lead-time evidence (multiple concluded messages) shows actual LT averaging ~1.7; use calculated average LT so OR backend adapts to observed variability. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent 6 periods to capture the current high-demand regime (N=6) so base-stock targets reflect the new demand level while sigma based on same window captures recent volatility.

Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand is well above historical: last 5 concluded demands (P18\u2013P22) = [140,219,220,147,146], avg\u2248174.4, reflecting the sustained high-demand regime starting around P11. Pipeline is large (on-hand 88 + in-transit 406 = 494) but recent weeks' demand is ~174/week, so risk of stockouts remains if we under-forecast. Observed concluded lead times (all concluded arrivals) average \u22481.58 periods, lower than the promised 2 but variable (mix of 1s and 2s). Therefore: set L using calculate (average observed lead times) so the backend uses realized lead-time evidence; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest high-demand regime (captures the last 5 weeks avg\u2248174). This balances service level (capturing the elevated demand) against holding costs given the large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): demand has been substantially above historical (sustained high regime from P11 onward). On-hand=58, in-transit=474 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead-times mostly 1\u20132 periods (recent average ~1.7). Choose L=calculate to let backend use observed average lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=13) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (P11\u2013P23). Use sigma recent_N (N=13) to reflect recent volatility. These settings align base-stock to the new higher-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time behavior and the large pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=518. Historical demand has shifted to a much higher regime since Period 11; recent weeks (P19\u2013P24) show high weekly demand (219,220,147,146,109,144) \u2014 sustained elevated demand. Lead-time observations across concluded arrivals are mixed (1\u20132 periods) with average ~1.6\u20131.7; earlier delays occurred but recent concluded arrivals mostly show 1\u20132. I choose L="calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 pattern while accounting for past delays). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent high-demand weeks (P19\u2013P24), scaled by (1+L) by the backend. This prioritizes service during the current high-demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive to recent volatility. The large in-transit volume (518) will be reconciled by the OR engine against the computed base stock; using recent demand and calculated L helps avoid underordering if lead times lengthen or demand remains elevated.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand remains substantially above historical sample (recent 6-period avg \u2248143 units vs historical 22). Concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period lead times (historical concluded samples produce average \u22481.7). To capture current high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data (most recent 6 periods: P20\u2013P25) so the OR engine scales target stock to current demand. For lead time I ask the backend to compute the average of observed concluded lead times (calculate) to reflect the actual/variable 1\u20132 period behavior seen in concluded messages. This balances higher service level during sustained elevated demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excessive pipeline given holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). On-hand=91, in-transit=475. Recent concluded arrivals show variable and often-delayed lead times (latest: P23 order arrived in P26 conclude \u2192 lead_time=3). Demand has been in a higher regime since P21: demands P21\u2013P26 = [147,146,109,144,94,56], recent 6-period average \u2248116 versus historical sample mean 22 (+~427%). To protect service given delayed arrivals and sustained elevated demand, set lead time explicitly to 3 (matches observed recent delay). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent 6 periods to capture the new high-demand regime (mu_hat recent_N N=6). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility. This increases target base_stock to meet higher demand and buffers against delayed arrivals while limiting excessive holding cost by using recent data rather than all-time history.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed elevated: recent concluded arrival P23\u2192P26 implies lead_time=3 (evidence of >2); Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods P21\u2013P26 avg demand=116 vs historical sample avg=22 (+427%), sustained 6 periods

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 21\u201326 avg \u2248116/week vs historical avg 22) and recent concluded lead times elevated/variable (observed recent concluded lead times include 3 and 2). Current inventory: on-hand=132, in-transit=391 (total pipeline 523) \u2014 ample coverage of several weeks of elevated demand, but lead time variability suggests using a short recent average of lead time while basing demand forecast on the confirmed high-demand regime. Therefore: set L via recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent lead-time observations (short/variable but >2 sometimes); set mu_hat via recent_N (N=6) to use the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 21\u201326); set sigma_hat via recent_N (N=6) to reflect volatility during that same recent regime. These choices balance service (avoid stockouts under much-higher demand) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

On-hand=87 + in-transit=391 provides large pipeline cover, but promised LT is unreliable. I set L using recent_N to let backend use the recent observed lead-time behavior. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current high-demand regime while limiting lookback to the most relevant weeks; this balances service level (higher forecast) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent history shows demand elevated vs original samples but trending down from a peak: last 6 demands (P24\u2013P29) = [144,94,56,63,45,38] \u2014 a moderated but still-above-historical mean. Lead-time history shows variability with a recent confirmed 3-period arrival (P23\u2192P26), so I choose a conservative explicit lead time to protect service. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods to capture the current down-shifting regime while preserving responsiveness. This balances service (longer L) vs holding cost given large in-transit stock (391) and on-hand 49.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has fallen from earlier peaks; last 6 realized demands (P25\u2013P30) = 94,56,63,45,38,34 (avg=55). Significant in-transit stock (371) plus on-hand 35 exists, but observed concluded lead times recently include multiple 3-period arrivals (e.g., P23\u2192P26 and P27\u2192P30) so actual lead time appears elevated. To protect service given delayed arrivals, set lead time explicitly to 3. Forecast demand using the most recent 6 periods to reflect the downshift from the extreme peak while still capturing recent volatility; apply same recent_N window to sigma to let the OR engine size safety stock appropriately. This balances avoiding stockouts from longer lead times vs. limiting excess holding given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent concluded arrivals show intermittent delays including a lead_time=3 observed most recently (P27\u2192P30). Demand has been elevated vs original historical samples; last 6 observed demands (P26\u2013P31 = 56,63,45,38,34,32) average \u224844.7, well above the original sample mean (22). To protect service given delayed arrivals, I set lead time explicitly to 3. For demand forecast and uncertainty I use the most recent 6 periods to capture the current elevated regime (mu_hat recent_N N=6, sigma_hat recent_N N=6). These choices raise target base stock to cover the longer effective lead time and higher recent demand while sigma_hat from recent volatility helps size safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent concluded history shows lead-times variable and occasionally >2 (e.g., P23\u2192P26 lead_time=3) but more recent concluded samples show mixed 1\u20133. Demand has fallen from earlier peaks; last 6 periods (P27\u2013P32) demand sequence = 63,45,38,34,32,25 (avg \u224839.5) \u2014 a sustained lower regime vs prior spikes. On-hand=0, in-transit=371 so pipeline is large. To balance service level vs holding cost I set lead time based on the most recent concluded lead-time samples (to capture recent volatility) and set demand forecast using the most recent 6 weeks to reflect the current lower-demand regime; sigma uses the same recent window to capture current variability. These choices avoid over-ordering for past peak demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability so the OR backend's base-stock calculation will aim at appropriate coverage of (1+L) periods given current demand.

I choose L by calculate to let the backend use observed lead-time history; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current lower recent demand regime and recent volatility, ensuring orders target (1+L) periods of expected demand while adapting safety stock to recent variability.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand (P28\u2013P34) slowed to an average ~31 units/wk after earlier spikes; on-hand=0 but sizable in-transit=371 units (covers multiple weeks). Historical concluded arrivals show occasional lead_time=3 (e.g., orders arriving P26\u2192P29/P30), so actual lead time appears elevated and variable. To protect service given variable/occasionally 3-period arrivals while avoiding excessive holding, I set L explicitly to 3. I forecast demand using the most recent 7 weeks (P28\u2013P34) to capture the current lower post-spike regime: mu_hat uses recent_N N=7. Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=7 so the OR engine sizes safety stock to observed recent variability. These choices balance service level (accounting for longer/variable lead time and current demand) with holding cost given large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=371. Historical concludes show multiple occasions of lead_time >2 (e.g., P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30) and several delayed arrivals\u2014I treat actual lead time as longer than promised. Recent realized demand (Periods 30\u201335 = 34,32,25,31,15,11; mean\u224824.7) is substantially lower than the earlier surge; I therefore forecast using the most recent 6 periods. Chosen L explicit=3 to guard against observed >2 delays; mu_hat recent_N N=6 and sigma_hat recent_N N=6 use the last 6 demands so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and scaled std, balancing service level (protect vs delayed arrivals) against holding cost while avoiding overstock from prior surge.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=371. Recent concluded demand (P31\u2013P36) = [32,25,31,15,11,18], recent mean \u224822. Historical sample mean=22 but lead-time observations show occasional >2 delays (concluded P23\u2192P26 lead_time=3) and many delayed/no arrivals earlier. To be conservative against delayed/lost shipments I set explicit L=3. I use a recent_N demand forecast (N=6) to capture the current low recent demand regime rather than earlier high spikes. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders cautious for longer transit while matching recent low demand, avoiding excess holding given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent concluded demand (P33\u2013P37 = 31,15,11,18,14) shows a clear downshift vs earlier high-demand regimes; using recent demand will avoid over-ordering. Lead times have been variable with occasional 3-period arrivals (e.g. P23\u2192P26) but more commonly 1\u20132; to adapt to recent variability I use a recent average lead-time estimate. On-hand=0, in-transit=371 (provides substantial pipeline cover), so reduce forecast to recent demand over the review+lead horizon to limit holding cost while covering short-term demand and uncertain arrivals. Choices: L recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent realized lead times; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to base forecast on the last 5 demands; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These settings steer the OR backend toward a conservative base-stock aligned with the current low-demand regime and recent lead-time behavior.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=371. Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (many arrivals with W in {1,2,3}); average observed lead time \u22481.81. Recent demand has fallen from prior peaks and stayed lower since ~Period 26 (sustained ~13 periods). To reflect realized shorter-than-promised average LT and recent low-demand regime, set L by calculation (avg observed LT) and set demand forecast/volatility using recent data. This balances service (use observed LT) while avoiding excess holding: mu_hat uses recent_N to anchor forecast to latest low-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N to capture recent volatility. In-transit 371 will be counted by backend as pipeline; chosen params prevent over-ordering against current low demand and elevated pipeline.

Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=371. Historical concluded lead times show occasional >2 and recent evidence of 3-period arrivals (P23\u2192P26); lead times are unstable. Recent demand (Periods 34\u201339 = 15,11,18,14,12,7) shows a sustained low regime vs earlier spikes, so use a short recent window to avoid inflating forecast. Choose L explicit=3 to protect against documented 3-period delays. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the current low-demand regime (uses last 6 observed demands). This keeps base_stock conservative to limit holding costs while accounting for longer delivery delays and current weak demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=390. Recent realized demand (Periods 33\u201341): [31,15,11,18,14,12,7,10,3] \u2192 demand has been low recently (~14 avg) after earlier high-volatility regime. Multiple past conclude messages show occasional lead_time=3 (e.g., P23\u2192P26, P27\u2192P30) and frequent delays; promised L=2 not reliable. I set L explicitly to 3 to protect against observed delayed arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=9 (Periods 33\u201341) to reflect the current low-demand regime and recent volatility; (1+L) scaling will be applied by backend. This balances high service-level target (profit/holding \u2192 q\u22480.95) with the need to avoid excess holdings given current low demand and substantial in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=390. History shows multiple instances of lead time > promised 2 (notably P23\u2192P26 lead_time=3 and several periods with delayed/no arrivals), so I treat lead time as elevated to cover delayed shipments. Recent demand (Periods 38\u201342 = 12,7,10,3,17) is substantially below earlier high-demand regimes; demand appears to have dropped to a low seasonal level. Therefore: set L explicit=3 to guard against observed >2 delays; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor forecast and volatility to the current low-demand regime (keeps orders small to avoid excess holding given slow demand and significant pipeline). This balances service (accounting for delayed arrivals) against holding cost by lengthening lead-time cover while scaling mean and volatility to the latest low-demand data.

Large pipeline (371) already covers multiple periods of demand so I will let the backend infer L from observed conclusions and use default demand/volatility estimates to avoid overreacting to recent low weekly sales. Chosen L method (calculate) lets OR use the empirical average lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat default let OR compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples so base-stock reflects full history while the calculated L adjusts the review+lead horizon.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent low demand (periods 41\u201344 = 3,17,2,5) contrasts with earlier sustained high-demand regimes; on-hand=12, in-transit=371 (many outstanding shipments, some delayed/lost historically). Observed concluded lead times (17 samples) average \u22481.82; evidence of variability including occasional 3-period delays. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average lead time (captures persistent variability > promised 2). For demand I use recent_N N=4 (periods 41\u201344) because demand has fallen sharply and sustainably in the last 4 periods; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent low-volatility. These choices reduce ordering against stale high-demand regimes and account for elevated/variable lead time to avoid stockouts from delayed in-transit units while limiting excess holding costs.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent observed demand over the last 5 concluded periods (P41\u2013P45) is low (3,17,2,5,6; mean\u22486.6) \u2014 holiday season/week before Christmas shows depressed demand versus historical mean (22). On-hand=6, in-transit=371 -> pipeline (377) far exceeds short-term demand; many prior shipments showed variable lead times (1\u20133), so use observed lead-time average rather than blind promised lead time. I select L by averaging observed lead times to reflect realized delivery behavior; set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering given large pipeline inventory. These choices reduce holding cost risk while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, In-transit=371. Historical sample mean=22 (samples from Jan\u2013Feb). Recent concluded demands (Periods 43\u201346) are low (2,5,6,6) but earlier windows showed higher regimes; lead time evidence is mixed with past delays but most recent concluded arrivals imply ~2\u20133 periods. Given large in-transit volume (371) and mixed/unstable demand signals, I choose conservative defaults so the OR engine uses promised lead time and full-sample demand estimates rather than overfitting to short-term noise. This avoids placing excessive new orders while awaiting confirmation of arrivals and demand shifts.
