Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows a sharp upward shift (samples: 0,0,14,52,121). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; risk of stockout is high. Use promised lead time (default L=2). For demand forecast, focus on the recent rising regime (last 3 periods: 14,52,121) so set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher mean across review+lead. Volatility likely increased with the regime shift, so set sigma_hat recent_N with N=3. These choices prioritize service (reduce lost-sales) while backend will cap orders; using recent data helps respond quickly to confirmed trend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: periods 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04 avg = 62.33 (from prior avg 0) based on samples [14,52,121]; sustained increase over 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=152 (order placed P1 reported arrived=0 in P1 conclude; with promised L=2 this is expected in-transit). Historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift (2019-01-21..2019-02-04 avg 62.33 from prior 0). Use promised lead time to avoid premature re-estimation given limited lead-time evidence. For demand, use recent_N based on the 3-period new regime (samples [14,52,121]) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 3 samples; this focuses the forecast on the confirmed higher-demand regime and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=325, profit=4, holding=1. Two recent conclude messages show orders placed in P1 and P2 have not arrived (arrived=0), so shipments are overdue but evidence is not yet sufficient to confirm a persistent lead-time change. Historical demand shows a recent regime shift (samples [14,52,121]) with higher demand. I keep L as default (promised 2) because lead-time change is unconfirmed. For demand I use recent_N=3 to capture the new higher regime (backend will scale by 1+L). For volatility I also use recent_N=3 to reflect recent sample variability. This balances higher service level to cover the confirmed demand spike while avoiding explicit lead-time adjustments until more arrival evidence is observed.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (orders from P1-P3: 152+173+112) \u2014 no arrivals concluded, suggesting prolonged/delayed shipments; promised L=2 appears unreliable so I set L explicit to 3 to hedge against further delays. Recent demand (Periods 1-3 concluded demands = 131,157,108) shows a sustained higher regime vs earlier samples; I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher mean/volatility over the last 3 periods. These choices increase target pipeline to meet the higher observed demand while accounting for delayed arrivals, balancing service level (reduce stockouts) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25 (Periods 1-3): avg increased from 62.33 to 132 (approx +112%), sustained over 3 periods

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=100, in-transit=397; recent concluded arrivals show an observed lead time of 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). Demand has recently settled into a higher regime (period demands: P1=131, P2=157, P3=108, P4=73). To capture the current elevated demand while reacting to recent decline, set lead time by calculation from observed lead times and use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine bases base_stock on the most recent 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent observed arrival (Period 4 conclude: Period 2 order arrived with lead_time=2) confirms actual lead time \u22482; several earlier orders missing but one confirmed 2-period arrival. Current on-hand=28, in-transit=397 (large pipeline). Recent demand has fallen from earlier peak\u2014last 3 observed demands = [108,73,72] -> lower recent mean. To balance service vs holding cost, set L to calculated average of observed lead times (uses evidence of observed 2-period arrival). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the recent downshift in demand (focus on last 3 periods) so base-stock and cap reflect current lower demand and avoid excess holding given large in-transit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=397. Concluded history shows one confirmed arrival: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). Recent realized demand (Periods 4-6) = [73,72,93] indicating a sustained higher-demand regime (~79.3). I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed 2). I set mu_hat recent_N N=3 to focus the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the latest 3 high-demand samples, which captures the new regime and avoids diluting with older zeros. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize service (meet current elevated demand) while keeping holding risk controlled given large in-transit pipeline (397) and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period 2 order arrived Period 4)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand shows elevated regime vs early 2019: last 4 demands = [73,72,93,317], mean=138.75 with a one-period spike (317) increasing short-term volatility. On-hand=0, in-transit=397 (sufficient nominal pipeline but arrivals are only visible after conclude). Lead time was previously confirmed as 2; I'll use the promised/default lead time. To adapt to the recent higher-demand regime while keeping safety for variability, I set mu_hat using a recent-window (N=4) to capture the elevated mean across the review+lead period, and sigma_hat using the same recent window (N=4) to reflect increased short-term volatility. This balances service level (capturing the demand jump) against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=591 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times confirm L=2. Recent demand has shifted up and become volatile (recent concluded demands P4-P8 = [73,72,93,317,199], mean\u2248150.8) so I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Choose L=default (promised 2) since arrivals historically match promised lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect the elevated recent average ((1+L)\xd7mean over last 5 periods \u2248 3\xd7150.8), and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture increased volatility. These settings raise the target base-stock to service the higher recent demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits additional ordering risk.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=608. Recent demand has stepped up (Periods 7-9: 317, 199, 118) indicating a higher current regime. Promised lead time is 2 and prior conclude messages confirm lead time = 2, so use default promised L to keep alignment with supplier. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated recent mean/volatility (focus on periods 7-9) so the OR engine raises the base-stock appropriately while limiting exposure to older low-demand samples. This balances service level during the recent spike against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Recent demand shows a new higher regime since Jan-Feb and volatile recent weeks (last 7 concluded demands: [73,72,93,317,199,118,82]) \u2014 use a recent_N estimate (N=7) to capture the current regime while smoothing older low-demand history. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the elevated/volatile demand while OR backend still using promised L=2 for its internal cap; large pipeline means immediate ordering pressure is low, but parameters should avoid understocking when those in-transit arrive or are delayed/lost.

Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=12, in-transit=569. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 periods and multiple recent high-demand periods (P7=317, P8=199, P9=118, P10=82, P11=117).

Demand appears to have shifted to a higher regime in the last 5 periods, so I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated mean over the review+lead horizon. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the base stock up to protect service against the recent high demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate urgency.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=626. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-period arrivals (P2\u2192P4, P8\u2192P10) with one 1-period arrival (P9\u2192P10); previous carry-over already confirmed LT=2. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (multiple periods >100, spikes to 317). Given sizable in-transit stock and confirmed promised lead time, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, letting the capped order cap limit excessive orders and avoid overstock while maintaining service for the higher recent demand.

Recent demand has settled at a higher regime vs. very low historical values; to capture current demand level and volatility I use recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent 5 demand observations to reflect the post-regime demand and avoid stale early zeros). This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but variable arrivals) against holding cost by letting OR compute base_stock from recent mean/variance and inferred lead time.

Recent demand regime changes were previously recorded; no additional sustained changepoint detected. Given large in-transit pipeline, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance; this avoids overreacting to recent week-to-week volatility while letting backend cap orders against pipeline.

Promised lead time=2 and concluded history repeatedly shows 2-period arrivals; use default lead time to align with promise and OR engine expectations. For demand I bias the forecast to recent behavior: use the last 12 demand observations to capture the current elevated regime while smoothing older low-demand samples. Use the same recent window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These settings let the backend size base-stock to meet higher recent demand while the large in-transit position limits aggressive additional ordering.

Historical concluded lead times support the promised 2-period lead time. To be responsive to the recent higher-demand regime while respecting the large in-transit pipeline, set L to default (promised=2), forecast mu_hat using a recent_N mean (N=4) to capture the current regime, and set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent variability.

Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-period arrivals (confirmed earlier) with one 1-period event; recent demand has moderated from prior peaks. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 2-period behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 13-18: 71,96,92,117,75,63) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower/volatile demand rather than older peak periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has stabilized after earlier regime shifts; last 7 demands (Periods 13\u201319) = [71,96,92,117,75,63,56], mean \u224881.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=569 (large pipeline). Historical concludes consistently show 2-period arrivals when concluded, so promised lead time remains consistent. To reflect recent demand while accounting for the large existing pipeline, I use L=default (promised 2), mu_hat based on the most recent 7 samples to capture the current regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean), and sigma_hat based on the same recent 7 samples to reflect current variability. This keeps the backend's base-stock aligned to current demand but the capped ordering will restrain new receipts because pipeline (569) already exceeds the (1+L)*recent mean.

On-hand=0, in-transit=569 \u2014 large pipeline exists but arrivals are observed with promised 2-period lead time historically. Use promised lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the current lower-demand regime (use last 8 demand samples) so base stock reflects recent mean/volatility over the review+lead period (1+L periods). This balances service (covering near-term demand) while avoiding excess holding given existing large in-transit volume.

Recent demand has trended down from spring peaks; I select recent_N to capture the most recent lower-demand regime. L uses promised/default (2). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the last 5 demand samples, reducing influence of earlier spring spike. This keeps target base-stock aligned with current lower demand while OR backend caps orders using its cap.

To avoid overreacting to older high-sales spikes and capture recent lower-demand regime, set L=default (promised 2). Forecast demand using recent_N (N=7) to weight latest 7 realized weekly demands (captures the downshift since spring). Use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability.

Promised lead time=2 and historical concludes consistently show 2-period arrivals (no new sustained lead-time change). To avoid overreacting to earlier spring spikes and to let the large in-transit stock cover near-term demand, keep L as promised and use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the recent lower-demand regime (N chosen equal to recent regime length \u224812 periods).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand (Periods 15-24) is lower and relatively stable compared with earlier spring spikes (samples: 92,117,75,63,56,24,41,45,40,17). On-hand=0, in-transit=569 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times consistently 2 periods; promised lead time=2. Set L to default (promised=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current lower regime (Periods 15-24) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This reduces overstating demand from earlier spikes while keeping service given the large in-transit position, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has moderated after earlier regime shifts (historic samples show sustained increases in Feb\u2013Mar). On-hand=0, in-transit=569 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times have repeatedly been 2 periods; no new sustained lead-time change. To let the OR engine use promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics while respecting the large pipeline, I select defaults: L=promised (uses backend promised lead time), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These defaults balance service level (using full-history mean/variance) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=569. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 (Periods 4 and 10 arrivals). Recent demand (Periods 17-26) shows a lower, stable regime vs earlier spikes: last 10 demands = [75,63,56,24,41,45,40,17,65,72], mean\u224849.8. To be responsive to the recent regime while using confirmed lead time, I set L=default (promised 2). I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of the last 10 periods (captures current demand level and avoids overstocking from early spikes). I also use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to capture current demand volatility. This balances service (covering 3-period demand at recent rates) against holding cost and accounts for confirmed lead time and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent weekly demand has averaged roughly mid-high tens (many weeks 40\u2013100+, occasional spikes) and on-hand = 0, in-transit = 569. Promised lead time = 2 and prior concloses confirm LT=2; no new sustained lead-time signal or demand regime change in the most recent periods. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the policy stable given a large in-transit pipeline and avoids overreacting to recent noise.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). Recent weekly demand (Periods 17-28) has been moderate and variable (range ~17\u2013117, recent weeks 24\u2013101, latest 77). On-hand=0 but in-transit=569 units (large pipeline) \u2014 this should cover (1+L) demand for several weeks. Promised lead time=2 and concluded history repeatedly shows 2-period arrivals; therefore I keep L as default (promised). To reflect the more recent, lower-volatility demand regime versus early-season spikes, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent periods (capture latest demand level to avoid overstocking despite large pipeline). These parameters let the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to current demand while the cap prevents excessive same-period ordering; large in-transit inventory reduces urgent ordering need.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=569. Historical concludes confirm actual lead times observed {2,2,1,2} (avg\u22481.75) but majority=2; pipeline large. To be robust to observed lead-time variation I let backend compute average observed lead time (method=calculate). Recent demand has been stable without a new sustained regime shift; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand pattern (captures latest seasonality and variance) so the OR engine sets base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while capping orders per its cap. This balances service (utilize large in-transit) versus holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=569. Historical concluded arrivals confirm typical lead times of ~2 periods (multiple observed 2-period arrivals). To reflect that confirmed lead time signal I set L using 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Recent weekly demand (Periods 21\u201330) shows a stable moderate regime (demands: 41,45,40,17,65,72,101,77,66,88); to capture current run-rate and recent volatility I use recent_N with N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (this weights the most relevant recent demand data covering the last 10 periods). These choices aim to keep the base-stock responsive to recent demand while the sigma estimate manages safety stock to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=569. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=2 (recorded earlier) and demand stabilized to moderate weekly levels since spring/summer. To be conservative given large in-transit inventory and confirmed LT=2, keep L as promised (default). Use recent demand to capture current regime: set mu_hat to recent_N with N=20 (captures last ~20 demand samples reflecting summer demand levels). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago high spikes. This balances service (use recent demand forecast) while avoiding overreaction to early high spikes and accounting for substantial pipeline already en route.

Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-period arrivals (with one 1-period) so use the calculated average lead time to capture observed variation. Demand history shows a sustained higher regime since Feb with no new changepoint; use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples and volatility accordingly.

Pipeline (569) covers multiple review+lead periods so risk of stockout is low; no evidence of recent lost shipments. Demand has been in a new, stable post-spring regime for many weeks, so I use recent data to capture current mean/volatility. Set L to default (promised). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 samples, balancing responsiveness to recent demand while smoothing noise. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock tuned to current demand while avoiding overreacting to single-week spikes.

Recent demand since spring/summer shows a steady nonzero regime (many weekly demands ~40\u2013100+). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (backed by concluded evidence) and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 20 weeks (captures current regime while smoothing older low-demand periods). This balances service (avoid stockouts given high pipeline variability) and holding cost by using a recent-demand-based base stock and volatility estimate rather than all-time average.

Recent demand (Periods 16\u201335) stabilised around ~65\u201390 with occasional spikes; to reflect current regime I use recent data window to forecast across the review+lead period so the OR engine replenishes against the recent mean and volatility while leveraging the large in-transit pipeline. Chosen methods: L default to use promised lead time (2); mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to capture the last ~20 demand observations and produce (1+L)*mean over the most recent regime; sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility over the same window.

Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=569. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time=2 previously; no new sustained lead-time shift observed. Recent weekly demand (Periods 25-36) averages moderate values (~60-90) after earlier regime shifts; no new changepoint in last 12 weeks. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 target service quantile q=4/(4+1)=0.8), use promised lead time and focus forecast on recent 12-week demand to be responsive to current seasonality while limiting excess inventory given a large in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=569. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 2 periods and demand has been in a lower, stable regime the past ~7 weeks (recent demands: 65,47,96,62,40,49,64; mean \u2248 60.4). To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 target fill ~\u03a6\u22121(4/(4+1))), use promised/confirmed lead time and base forecasts from the recent 7-week regime so the OR engine adapts to current demand level while avoiding excess inventory given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=569. Historical concluded arrivals confirm mostly 2-period lead times (several P->P+2 observations, occasional P+1). Demand in recent months is stable ~40\u2013100/wk with no new sustained regime shift. To balance service vs holding cost, use calculated lead time from observed concludes and recent demand statistics (last 20 periods) to capture current demand mean/volatility while avoiding overreacting to single-week spikes. This keeps base-stock sized to cover (1+L) periods of demand with volatility estimated from recent history; it also leverages large in-transit here to avoid excess ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Pipeline alone covers multiple weeks of demand, so rely on backend's default lead-time and demand estimates using full history. Using defaults avoids overreacting to recent low week (demand=18) and lets OR engine cap orders given existing pipeline, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=569. Promised lead time is 2 and prior concluded history confirms LT=2; keep L as default (use promised). Demand recent history (last ~12 weeks) shows stable nonzero weekly demand (range ~40\u2013100); use a recent-N demand estimate to capture current regime and avoid dilution by early zero-stock periods. High service target (q=0.8) due to profit/holding (4/1) implies a larger safety stock; using recent_N for mu and sigma concentrates on current demand volatility. The large in-transit position already provides coverage; these parameters direct the OR engine to top up to a base-stock appropriate for (1+L) review+lead period using recent demand stats.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=569. Historical concluded lead times consistently 2 (confirmed previously); no new lead-time evidence -> keep promised. Recent demand has fallen to low steady values (last 3 concluded demands: 18, 27, 33). To capture the current low-demand regime I use a short recent window (N=3) for demand mean and volatility. Large in-transit position already provides coverage vs (1+L) demand; the chosen parameters bias toward lower forecasted replenishment to avoid excess holdings given holding cost $1 vs profit $4.

Recent demand has been stable weekly (many nonzero weeks since Period 7). I select recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent ~5 months of weekly demand, so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility and balances service level vs holding cost given current large pipeline.

Recent demand (Periods 24\u201343) is lower and stable versus early 2019 spikes; I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current lower regime while capping window size to 20 samples to avoid overfitting older spikes. Set L to promised (default=2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect the last stable demand regime and give the OR engine updated mean and volatility over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (use recent demand to meet current sales) against holding cost given a large in-transit quantity.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=569. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 in earlier periods; no new conclude messages indicating a different lead time or sustained demand regime change in recent weeks. Recent weekly demand has been moderate (20\u2013100 range) without a sustained shift. Given a confirmed 2-period promised lead time and no strong recent changepoint, use defaults so the OR engine computes base_stock from the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This ensures the backend accounts for long-run demand estimates while the large in-transit quantity (569) will be compared to base_stock\u2212pipeline by the engine to avoid over-ordering.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=2; no new sustained demand regime or lead-time changes in recent weeks (demand in last 10 periods \u2248 23\u201362). In-transit (569) already provides substantial coverage; to avoid overreacting to noise near year-end, use promised/default settings so the OR engine uses full historical mean/variance across samples.
