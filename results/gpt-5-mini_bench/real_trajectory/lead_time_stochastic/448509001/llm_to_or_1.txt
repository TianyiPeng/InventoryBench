Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 448509001 has historic weekly samples (65,117,162,118,146) showing recent elevated demand (~avg 121.6) with no concluded arrivals or in-transit stock. Promised lead time is 2; no evidence of lead-time shifts or lost shipments yet. Use default lead time to let OR use promised L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level given profit $4 vs holding $1. This keeps parameters conservative until we observe concluded arrivals or sustained regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Promised lead time=2. No concluded arrivals yet for the P1 order (ordered=183, arrived=0) \u2014 expected arrival is during Period 3 (visible in Period 4 conclude). Historical weekly samples mean=121.6 (5 samples); no sustained 3+ period regime shift detected. On-hand=0, in-transit=183 which is short of a (1+L)=3 period demand forecast (~365 units). To avoid overreacting to a single order delay and because no lead-time change is confirmed, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=367 (orders from P1/P2). Promised lead time=2. No concluded arrivals observed yet (Period1 & Period2 conclude show arrived=0), so actual lead time not confirmed and shipments may be delayed but not proven lost. Demand history (5 samples mean=121.6) and no clear recent demand shift; use default methods so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with promised L to balance service vs holding given profit/holding ratio.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=437 (orders from P1-P3). Promised L=2 but no arrivals in Periods 1-3 conclude messages (orders from P1-P3 still not arrived), so actual lead time appears longer than promised; to be conservative set L explicit=3. Demand history (5 samples) mean=121.6/wk; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std given the chosen L, balancing higher cover for longer lead time while letting OR cap limit order size.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >2 periods: orders placed P1-P3 (total 437 units) had arrived=0 in Periods 1-3 conclude messages, indicating sustained delay beyond promised L=2.

Daily Reward (R_t): $681.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). On-hand=11, in-transit=380 (pipeline=391). History shows one confirmed arrival with lead_time=2 (order P2 arrived in Period 4) while earlier orders showed delays; no sustained evidence to change promised L. Profit/Holding => q=0.8 (high service level). Choose L=calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed =2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all samples) to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this keeps supply coverage for (L+1) periods while balancing higher service level against holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=436; recent concludes show one observed lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4) but earlier orders were delayed/possibly lost (P1,P3). To be conservative I let the backend infer lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate). Demand history mean=121.6/week; using default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) lets the OR engine compute base-stock and cap consistently with its formulas while accounting for the longer effective review+lead horizon. This balances service (higher base stock for multi-period coverage) vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=432. Recent realized demands: P2\u2013P6 = [150,115,173,225,166] (elevated vs earlier Jan samples). Arrival history shows mixed lead times: observed W=2 (P2\u2192P4) and W=1 (P5\u2192P6), and earlier long delays for P1\u2013P3 suggesting earlier disruption but recent deliveries resumed. I set L=calculate to let the backend average observed lead times (reflects mixed 1\u20132 period evidence). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent higher-demand regime (last 5 periods) so mu_hat reflects current elevated demand; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture current variability. This raises target base-stock to protect service given strong recent demand while keeping volatility estimate local to avoid over-ordering from older low-demand samples. The parameters also recognize the large in-transit quantity (432) when backend computes final order.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concludes show inconsistent but delayed arrivals: orders from Periods 1-3 (total 437 units) produced arrived=0 in their conclude messages, while later orders had arrives with lead_time 1-2. On-hand=0, in-transit=556 \u2014 significant pipeline but evidence of shipments delayed > promised L=2. To be conservative against stockouts given sustained delays, set L explicitly to 3 (captures the observed multi-period delays). Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging historical mean demand ~121.6). This raises target base-stock to cover the longer effective lead+review horizon, balancing higher service (profit $4) vs holding cost $1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >2 periods: orders placed P1-P3 (total 437 units) had arrived=0 in Periods 1-3 conclude messages, indicating sustained delay beyond promised L=2.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed W = 2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5) and demand has spikes (recent demands: 173,225,166,139,261) with on-hand=0 and in-transit=465. I choose L=calculate to let backend use the average observed lead time from concluded messages. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples \u2014 this balances service level against holding cost without overfitting short-term noise given some late/variable arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 225,166,139,261,158; mean\u2248190). On-hand=0, in-transit=531 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times recent: 2,1,2,1 (avg 1.5). To balance service vs holding cost I estimate lead time from recent observations (recent_N) to capture current variability, use recent 5 periods for demand statistics to reflect the recent higher demand regime, and use matching recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility. Large in-transit means orders will likely arrive soon but actual lead times have varied, so parameters favor recent-local demand estimates while letting backend cap orders using its cap formula.

LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2 periods; average \u22481.5), and there is no sustained >2 confirmation across 3+ consecutive concluded periods, so use calculated average lead time. Demand history (65,117,162,118,146) shows no clear recent regime shift\u2014use population defaults for mu and sigma so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (use observed lead-time avg) against holding cost given large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=493 \u2014 large pipeline expected to cover upcoming demand but arrivals are only visible next period. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,1} \u2192 average 1.5, so I use calculate for L to capture shorter-than-promised recent behavior. Demand history shows no clear sustained regime shift; use default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (use measured shorter lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=512. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 1 and 2 periods (mixed), average near 1.5 \u2014 earlier delays existed but recent concluded history displays consistent 1\u20132 period behaviour. Pipeline (512) already provides substantial cover; however, to account for variable lead time I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Demand history is limited and no clear recent regime shift in mean/variance is detected, so I use default aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). These settings let the OR backend adapt base stock to the empirically observed lead time while using full-sample demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=512. Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,1] (six observations), implying an average lead time ~1.5. Use L='calculate' so backend estimates average observed lead time from concluded history. Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively; this balances service (higher effective review+lead demand due to L\u22481.5) versus holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as ~1.5 periods (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,1] from concluded arrivals across Periods 4\u201310).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent concluded arrivals imply actual lead time has averaged ~1.5 periods (mix of 1 and 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=493 (large pipeline). Demand has fallen steadily over last 6 concluded periods (158,115,109,84,63,65). To reflect the shorter observed lead-time signal while keeping the OR engine informed of recent lower demand, I set L using a recent average of observed lead times (captures the 1/2 alternation). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 demand samples to capture the clear downward regime and reduced variability; this keeps base-stock responsive and avoids overstock given the large in-transit quantity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=493 (large pipeline). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (sequence avg ~1.5) but signal not strongly different from promised L=2; several deliveries have arrived so use backend's empirical averaging for L. Use mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (robust to limited recent-sample noise) and lets the capped ordering cap constrain order quantity given the large in-transit pipeline. This balances service (using calculated L) against holding costs given high in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Multiple earlier periods showed delayed/no arrivals but recent concluded data stabilizes around alternating 1\u20132 periods. To let the OR engine infer an effective lead time from observed history, I choose L='calculate' (use average of observed lead times). Demand forecast and uncertainty will use dataset-wide defaults so the backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (uses inferred average lead time) against holding cost without overreacting to intermittent lost shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=493. Historical concluded arrivals show alternating 1\u20132 period lead times (avg ~1.5); recent demand has trended down since the April peak (Periods 10\u201317 = [115,109,84,63,65,59,47,40]). I set L explicit=1.5 to reflect the observed average lead time (helps align expected pipeline timing vs. promised L=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (the 8-period recent low-demand regime from P10\u2013P17) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(last 8 demands) and sigma_hat based on the same recent 8-sample window; this keeps forecasts responsive to the sustained lower-demand regime while the explicit L corrects for lead-time bias and reduces over-ordering given holding cost (profit=$4, holding=$1).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=493; recent conclude history shows mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals with average ~1.5. Promised L=2 but concluded arrivals indicate shorter effective lead-time; several earlier prolonged delays occurred but later periods (P4\u2013P14) show lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,1], avg=1.5. I set L explicit=1.5 to reflect concluded evidence. Base demand samples mean = 121.6 (from provided historical samples); using (1+L)=2.5 gives mu_hat = 2.5*121.6 = 304.0 (explicit) to cover review+lead demand. Sample std \u2248 36.96; scaled by sqrt(1+L)=sqrt(2.5)=1.5811 gives sigma_hat \u2248 58.4 (explicit). These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the longer review+lead demand while recognizing concluded faster arrivals vs. promised L, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Historical concluded arrivals show shorter/variable lead times (observed sequence ~[2,1,2,1,2,1], avg \u22481.5), and demand has declined recently (weeks P11\u2013P19 avg \u224861 vs earlier higher levels). To reflect realized lead-time evidence use calculate (backend averages observed lead times). To capture the recent lower demand regime I use recent_N with N=9 (last 9 demand periods P11\u2013P19) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock and safety stock respond to the downshift while avoiding overstating variance. This balances service (avoid stockouts given substantial in-transit) against holding costs.

Demand has fallen sharply since spring; recent 5-period demand average is much lower than earlier samples, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current lower volatility. These choices prioritize matching reduced near-term demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit position.

Demand historical samples (5 weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb 2019) have mean\u2248121.6; no recent sustained demand regime change detected. To let the OR backend infer the empiric average lead time from concluded arrivals, set L='calculate'.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent history shows long stretches of zero on-hand and many periods with no arrivals despite past orders; currently on-hand=0, in-transit=493. Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods (mixed); prior evidence suggested ~1.5 periods. To let the OR engine infer average realized lead time from concluded arrivals, I choose L='calculate'. Demand history is limited to the provided samples and varies; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance profit vs holding cost given its forecast and promised lead time. This approach is conservative given overdue shipments: it relies on backend's statistics rather than aggressive explicit forecasts that could worsen holding costs if shipments later arrive.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=493. Recent demand (Periods 11\u201323) has been low-to-moderate but variable (samples: 109,84,63,65,59,47,40,30,33,22,39,97,91). No concluded arrivals since Period 14 despite large in-transit volume, indicating shipments overdue. To be conservative versus promised L=2, set lead time explicitly to 3 to cover extended/lost shipments. Forecast demand using the most recent regime (Periods 11\u201323) to reflect the lowered recent demand: mu_hat recent_N N=13. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=13 to capture recent volatility. These settings raise the review+lead forecast around current demand regime while acknowledging longer arrival risk, so the OR backend will order against a 3-period lead and recent demand pattern, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >2 periods: no concluded arrivals from Period 15\u201323 while in-transit=493 units, suggesting extended lead time or lost shipments for orders outstanding before Period 15.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=493. Historical concluded lead_times showed intermittent 1\u20132 periods (avg ~1.5) but there have been no concluded arrivals from Periods 15\u201324 despite 493 units in-transit, suggesting extended lead time or lost shipments. To be conservative I set L explicitly longer than promised to cover delayed/lost shipments. Demand recently is lower than early-spring but volatile with a late-June/July spike; I use the most recent 10 demand samples to capture current regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices aim to raise available pipeline cover (longer L) while basing forecast and volatility on recent observed demand to balance service and holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=493; recent history shows many periods with no concluded arrivals (Periods 15\u201325) suggesting extended lead time or lost shipments. To be conservative against stockouts I set lead time explicit=3 (longer than promised 2) so the OR engine orders for a longer pipeline. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (stable sample set from Jan\u2013Feb) \u2014 this balances higher safety stock from longer L while letting the OR cap limit extreme orders given observed demand variance.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=524; history shows intermittent concluded arrivals and long gaps with many overdue/in-transit units, so actual lead times have been unstable and recent behavior suggests extended delays. To avoid stockouts while accounting for delayed arrivals I set L explicitly to 3 (conservative above promised 2). Recent demand (Periods 22\u201326 = [97,91,65,79,120]) indicates a current mean ~90.4/week; using recent_N=5 for mu_hat gives the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled recent mean to capture current regime. Volatility also appears regime-specific, so I supply sigma_hat as recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand variance. These choices bias ordering toward higher coverage to protect service level given many overdue shipments, while using recent data to limit excess holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=524 with many periods of zero concluded arrivals since Period 15 \u2014 risk of extended lead time or lost shipments. Historical concluded lead_times earlier averaged ~1.5 but recent prolonged non-arrivals justify planning for longer lead time. I set L explicitly to 3 to protect against further delays and cover more pipeline demand. Demand has risen recently (last 5 demands: P23\u2013P27 = 91,65,79,120,182); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, yielding orders sized to cover 4 periods of demand with volatility reflecting the most recent regime. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given missing arrivals) against holding cost by relying on recent demand samples rather than the full older history.

LLM Rationale:

Demand pattern has shifted since Spring; I base demand forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations to capture current summer sales volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR engine on the latest regime while L='calculate' lets the system infer observed lead time from concluded arrivals. This balances service (capture recent higher demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead_times (sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2) averaging ~1.57; many recent outstanding in-transit units have not concluded (possible delays/losses) but that is inconclusive for an immediate lead-time redefinition. I choose to let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concluded arrivals (calculate) so L reflects realized behavior. For demand I use default aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples) and default volatility; this balances service level vs holding cost given uncertain/partially missing arrivals and limited sustained regime-change evidence.

To be conservative vs. lost/delayed shipments I set L explicit=3. Recent demand has shifted upward (last 5 concluded demands P26\u2013P30 = [120,182,158,114,165], avg\u2248147.8), so I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime and recent volatility.

I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures faster-than-promised patterns seen in concluded arrivals). Demand history (samples mean=121.6) is stable across provided weeks, so I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute safety stock while respecting inferred lead time. This balances service (using observed shorter average lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and prior missing shipments.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead-times but recent concluded lead_times (from arrivals in Periods 4\u201310 and Period 32) suggest a shorter average (~1.5). Demand has risen recently (periods 27\u201333 demands: 182,158,114,165,135,134,275) indicating a higher recent regime. I set L using recent observed lead times to capture the shorter recent fulfillment behavior. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand samples to reflect the recent higher-demand regime and its volatility so the backend's base-stock better covers (1+L) periods of demand while avoiding excessive holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Demand has become volatile recently (large spikes in late periods), so I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent demand regime (last 5 demands) to capture current mean and variability. These choices keep the OR backend responsive to recent demand while the recent_N lead-time estimate mitigates risk from earlier prolonged delays; using recent demand/std will balance service level versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 (large outstanding pipeline; several past orders delayed). Concluded lead-times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods recently; I use L.method=calculate to let backend average observed lead times from concluded arrivals. Demand has been volatile but recent weeks show higher and variable demand (Periods 32\u201336 demands = 134, 275, 134, 110, 79). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to focus the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent regime, and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting current elevated demand while accounting for pipeline uncertainty and holding cost via the backend's capped policy.

Observed concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,1] \u2192 avg \u22481.44; use calculated lead time so backend uses empirical observed LT rather than the promised 2. Demand recently is volatile; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest regime (last 5 demand observations) so orders cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost >0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=576. Recent concluded arrivals (P32, P36) show short lead times (1), but historical arrivals alternate 1\u20132 and several long gaps/lost shipments earlier. I choose L='recent_N' to bias toward the most recent observed faster arrivals while still smoothing with a small sample. Demand has been variable recently; use recent demand (last 5 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime (higher mid-autumn demand). These settings aim to keep pipeline cover for (1+L) periods using recent demand while limiting overstock risk given holding cost>$1 and past missing/lost shipments.

Historical concluded lead_times vary (1\u20132 periods with earlier multi-period delays), so I let the backend compute an empirical average (method=calculate) to reflect observed variability. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (uses full history), letting the optimizer balance service level (via calculated L) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=576. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead-times (1\u20132 periods) with intermittent long delays earlier; no recent sustained shift beyond the promised L=2 that is conclusively persistent. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P36\u2013P40 demands = 79,93,133,64,55) averages ~84.8/week and shows moderate volatility. To respect observed short lead-time behavior while letting the OR engine compute a robust base-stock, set L to backend-calculated average of observed lead times, and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent regime and avoid overweighting older seasonal spikes. This balances service level (capture recent higher weeks like 133) versus holding cost given zero on-hand but large in-transit.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-11-25 (P42). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 \u2014 large pipeline but no concluded arrivals in last 5 periods (P37\u2013P41). Historical concluded lead_times vary (1\u20132) but there is repeated evidence of extended delays/lost shipments; to protect service level I use a longer explicit L. I set L explicit=3 to cover observed extended delays. Demand is nonstationary with recent higher weekly peaks (late-summer/early-fall); I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (balances responsiveness vs. noise). These choices increase target base-stock to raise fill rates given uncertain/delayed arrivals while using recent volatility to avoid overreacting to one spike.

Carry-over insight: Extended delay/lost-shipment signal: Periods 37\u201341 (2019-10-21 to 2019-11-18) had zero concluded arrivals for SKU 448509001 while in-transit=576 at Period 42, indicating sustained delivery delays or missing shipments.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=576 with many recent periods of zero concluded arrivals => elevated risk of extended lead times or lost shipments. Recent weekly demand (historical seed samples Jan\u2013Feb 2019) mean = 121.6 units. To be conservative given delayed arrivals, set lead time explicitly longer than promised (L=3) so the OR backend orders for a longer pipeline. Use an explicit mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 4*121.6 = 486.4 to cover review+lead demand under the extended lead-time estimate. Keep sigma_hat at default so backend scales volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize avoiding stockouts given large outstanding in-transit and observed delivery delays while letting the OR engine cap orders per its policy.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=591 with many consecutive concluded periods showing no arrivals since Period 37 \u2192 strong signal of extended delays or lost shipments. To protect service given uncertain/extended actual lead times I set lead time explicit=3 (longer than promised 2). Using mu_hat default and sigma_hat default lets the OR backend compute (1+L)-period demand stats from historical samples while the longer L increases target cover for pipeline uncertainty. This balances higher service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and missed arrivals) against holding cost by relying on backend's capped ordering.

Carry-over insight: Extended delay/lost-shipment signal continues through Period 43: no concluded arrivals in Periods 37\u201343 while in-transit rose to 591 by Period 44, indicating ongoing delivery delays or missing shipments.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=591 with many overdue/no-conclude arrivals in recent history indicating intermittent extended lead times/lost shipments. Promised L=2 is unreliable; be conservative and assume a longer effective lead time to cover delays. I set L explicit=3 to protect against further late arrivals. Demand has recently stepped up (latest 5 demands: P40\u2013P44 = 55,48,274,108,163) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime; this yields a forecast that scales with (1+L) and a recent volatility estimate to inform safety stock. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given the large in-transit balance and uncertain arrivals while letting the OR backend trade off service vs holding cost using the supplied profit/holding ratio.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=661 with a history of mixed arrivals (observed lead_times mostly 1\u20132, but occasional extended/no arrivals and potential lost shipments). To let the OR backend infer a robust lead-time while acknowledging observed variability, I select 'calculate' to use the average of concluded lead times. For demand I use the backend defaults (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the engine computes base_stock and cap from full history; this balances service level versus holding cost given profit/holding ($4/$1). No explicit upward bias to mu or sigma is added here because recent demand shows high variability and past arrivals are unreliable; letting the backend use full-sample stats is conservative and stable.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=661 with a history of intermittent short (1\u20132) lead times but many extended/no arrivals between P15\u2013P44 indicating lost/delayed shipments. Concluded arrivals yield observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,1,1,2] \u2192 avg \u22481.44. To let the OR engine use empirical evidence of shorter-than-promised deliveries while retaining its demand-statistics routines, I request the backend compute L as the average of observed lead times (method=calculate). For demand and volatility I defer to the backend defaults (mu_hat default = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples); sigma_hat default = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)) so the OR engine computes base-stock and the capped order using the inferred L and full historical demand sample set. This balances aiming for service (using observed shorter lead time) while letting the engine account for variability in demand.
