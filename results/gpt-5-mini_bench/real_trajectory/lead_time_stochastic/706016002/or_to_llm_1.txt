{
  "rationale": "Period 46 observation: on-hand=1865, in-transit=7543 \u2192 total available (physical + pipeline)=9408 units. Historical concluded arrivals confirm variable lead times but most recently LT\u22482 with some lost shipments; pipeline counts are therefore unreliable but large. Weekly historical demand samples (given list) show typical weekly demand in the 300\u2013600 range, with occasional spikes to ~1366 (P42). Even using a high service-level (q=0.8 \u2192 high base-stock), expected (L+1)-period demand = (1+2)\xd7mean_weekly \u22483\xd7~460\u22481380 units \u2014 far below current combined inventory. Holding cost is $1/unit/period while profit is $4/unit, so excess inventory carries meaningful holding penalty each period. OR recommends 0 units; given the very large on-hand and pipeline, risk of stockout is negligible and ordering would only increase holding cost and potential obsolescence. Therefore place no order this period.",

{
