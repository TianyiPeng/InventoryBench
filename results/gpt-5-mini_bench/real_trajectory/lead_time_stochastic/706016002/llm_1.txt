  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas) so modest uplift vs recent Dec weeks is possible. Lead time & pipeline: carry-over evidence (P27->P30, P30->P32, P32->P35 etc.) confirms actual lead time \u2248 3 periods; recent pipeline arrivals have been consistent so treat in-transit=6774 as usable. Demand estimate: recent weeks (P40\u2013P45) averaged ~448 with one Black Friday spike; more typical Dec weekly demand has been ~300\u2013400. Planning rule: ensure coverage for (L+1)=4 weeks of demand. Required cover (conservative) 4\xd7400=1600 units. Inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=6774 >> 1600, so no replenishment needed. Ordering would only incur unnecessary holding cost given ample pipeline. Final action: order 0.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, New Year) \u2014 demand typically falls after peak holiday weeks. Product: skinny denim \u2014 steady, not extremely seasonal beyond holiday spike. Demand regime: recent weekly demand (Periods 43\u201346) = [306,351,265,231], trending down ~~300/week; prior Black Friday spike (Period 42=1366) was a one-week event, not sustained. Lead time / pipeline reliability: historical evidence shows variable lead times (2\u20133 periods) and some lost orders earlier, but no new sustained lead-time change since Period 38. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=6774 \u2014 this pipeline covers many weeks of expected demand (6774 / ~300 \u2248 22 weeks). Holding vs profit: profit $4/unit, holding $1/unit/period \u2014 ordering more now would incur substantial holding costs while demand is currently low. Decision: do not place new orders this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and because in-transit stock is ample to meet near-term demand; monitor arrivals next periods to confirm actual lead-time and adjust if pipeline shortfalls appear.",
