Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 706016002 has no on-hand or in-transit inventory. Historical weekly demand (5 samples through 2019-02-04) shows mean demand ~527 units with a recent uptick to 649 on 2019-02-04; no sustained regime change (only 1 high week). Promised lead time is 2 periods and no concluded arrivals exist to contradict it. Use default lead time to respect contract, default mu_hat to leverage full-sample mean for (1+L) demand coverage, and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes safety stock from full-sample variability. This balances service (cover upcoming demand including the recent spike) against holding cost given limited evidence of a persistent shift.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=659 (order placed Period 1). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lost or shortened shipments. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show no sustained regime shift. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level with holding cost given limited evidence to adjust forecasts.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=1308 (orders from P1/P2 not yet concluded). Two consecutive periods with no concluded arrivals could be delay but not yet 3+ periods of evidence to declare a lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) and demand estimates based on full-sample historical mean (samples: 557,438,489,500,649) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level against holding cost while we wait for concluded arrivals to confirm any lead-time shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1692 (orders placed P1=659, P2=649, P3=384). Historical weekly demand mean ~526.6 (samples provided). No concluded arrivals for orders placed in P1\u2013P3 (arrived=0 in Periods 1\u20133 concludes) \u2014 shipments are delayed beyond the promised L=2. To avoid understocking while shipments are delayed, I set L explicitly to 3 (conservative estimate). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples using the explicit L; this raises the target base-stock and safety stock to cover the longer effective lead+review horizon and balance profit vs holding cost given current high pipeline uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed >=3 periods (orders placed P1\u2013P3 did not arrive by their expected arrivals at L=2; ordered units: P1=659, P2=649, P3=384; arrived=0 in Periods 1\u20133 concludes).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1526.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=214, in-transit=1552. History: orders placed P1\u2013P3 initially showed no arrivals, but Period 4 conclude shows order from P2 arrived with lead_time=2 (evidence of at least one 2-period arrival). Overdue/missing arrivals noted but not yet a sustained new lead-time regime. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the confirmed 2-period arrival while allowing future updates). Use mu_hat and sigma_hat 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable baseline given limited data; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to possibly lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded demand: P1\u2013P5 = [544,545,451,435,464] \u2014 recent demand center ~ 467/wk. Pipeline shows 1552 in-transit (some prior orders missing/late), and arrivals have been inconsistent (P2 arrived with L=2 but others delayed). Given evidence of delayed shipments and the prior note that some orders exceeded promised lead time, I set lead time explicitly to 3 to be conservative. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest stable five observations; this yields (1+L)-scaled mean/volatility reflecting the 4-period review+lead demand window and keeps safety appropriate versus holding cost (profit $4 vs holding $1 => moderate service target). Parameters balance higher expected demand coverage across the longer effective lead while avoiding excessive inventory by using recent data.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=2041 (pipeline large, some prior orders delayed or lost: P1/P3 showed no arrival; P2 arrival confirms at least one 2-period lead_time). I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (recent confirmed = 2). Demand history (weekly samples) and promised L=2 imply using default demand scaling so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (use observed lead time) vs holding cost by not inflating forecasts beyond data-driven defaults given large pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals show an observed lead time of 2 periods (order on Period 2 arrived in Period 4). Several earlier orders were delayed but we now have concrete evidence of at least one L=2 arrival. On-hand is 0 with 2041 in-transit: pipeline is large but arrival timing uncertain for some batches. I select L by calculating the average of observed lead times (to let backend reconcile mixed arrivals), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all historical demand samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend blends long-run demand with the inferred lead time and caps ordering to control holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order placed Period 2 arrived Period 4).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=1552. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (Period 4 & 8 evidence). To remain consistent with confirmed lead time and use the provided historical demand samples, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base-stock from all samples. This avoids overreacting to recent volatility while letting the OR engine balance service level (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1) via its q-based z*.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1732 units. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4; Period 6 order arrived in Period 8). I therefore keep L as promised. Demand has trended up recently (last six concluded demands: 435,464,461,542,795,538) so I base forecasts on the most recent 6 periods to capture the higher mean and volatility. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute a (1+L)-period demand forecast and a volatility estimate that reflect the recent regime while leveraging the capped order cap to limit extreme orders.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 P11. On-hand=0, in-transit=1631. Recent concluded lead times: orders observed with lead_times = {P2->P4:2, P6->P8:2, P9->P10:1} (last 3 observed = 2,2,1). Demand recent sequence (concludes P6\u2013P10): {461,542,795,538,425} showing a short spike at P8 but otherwise elevated demand. To balance service vs holding cost given mixed but mostly 2-period evidence, I set L via recent average of last 3 observed lead times (captures recent variability). For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the current elevated regime including the spike while smoothing with nearby weeks. For volatility I use recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices give the OR engine a short-term, evidence-based lead time and demand estimate that covers review+lead periods and responds to the recent demand spike without overreacting to a single week.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=1868. Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2 (P2->P4), 2 (P6->P8) and 1 (P9->P10) \u2014 average \u22481.67. Several early orders were delayed/lost but recent conclues confirm typical arrivals around 2 periods. I set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent 2-period pattern while acknowledging occasional 1-period). Demand shows no clear sustained regime shift vs. historical samples, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full sample set). This balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost without overreacting to transient missing shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed Ls = 2,2,1) but overall recent average is < promised 2. I choose to let backend calculate average lead time from observed conclusions to reflect this variability. Demand has been elevated in recent weeks (Period8-12 demands = 795,538,425,385,353) so I use a recent_N=5 forecast for mean and volatility to capture the current higher-demand regime and reduce influence of older low-demand samples. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the recent high demand while the OR backend will trade off service level vs holding cost using profit/holding ratio.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=1631. Historical concluded lead times show majority at 2 periods (P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13) with one observed 1-period outlier (P9->P10); average observed LT \u22481.75. Demand historical samples (seed) show mean ~526.6. To balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) and account for mixed but mostly 2-period LTs, set L by averaging observed lead times so OR uses realized LT signal; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set, providing conservative replenishment given high in-transit inventory.

Recent demand appears stable-ish but elevated vs. early-year samples; use last 5 demand periods to capture the current regime (Periods 10\u201314 demands = 425,385,353,280,389). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current mean/volatility and let backend scale by (1+L).

Recent demand (Periods 11-15) = [385,353,280,389,471], recent mean \u2248375.6. To balance service vs holding cost given substantial pipeline and slightly elevated recent demand, set L to the observed average (let backend compute), and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the most recent regime (captures recent mean ~376 and recent variability) while letting the OR engine scale by (1+L).

Date 2019-06-03 Period 17. On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times recently (observed sequence of lead_times: 2,2,1,2); I use a recent average to capture this short-term mix. Demand has risen vs. the Jan sample set; the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 12\u201316 = 353,280,389,471,486) indicate a higher steady mean, so I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on those 5 samples to respond to the current regime while keeping safety for variability and the 2-period promise.

Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 periods (confirmed P2->P4, P6->P8) and several earlier delayed/lost shipments have since resolved. Demand history is volatile but centers ~400\u2013500 units/week; profit=4, holding=1 (service level target q=4/(4+1)=0.8). Use promised/default lead time so OR engine uses L=2; use default \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set\u2014this leverages all available demand history and the long in-transit stock (1642) to avoid over-ordering while achieving the higher service level implied by profit/holding.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent weekly demand ~350\u2013800, typical around 400\u2013500; profit $4 / holding $1 so target service level high. On-hand=0, in-transit=1642 (large pipeline from earlier orders). Concluded lead-time observations mostly 2 periods (several P->P+2 arrivals) with occasional 1 and earlier long delays; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast/volatility on the most recent 10 demand observations (captures current demand level and variance) so base-stock and cap reflect recent demand while the large in-transit reduces net ordering. This balances service (high profit) against holding cost by using recent demand and inferred average lead time.

I set L by 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time rather than the promised 2 to reflect mixed/shorter recent deliveries. Demand has been ~400\u2013490 recently; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the latest regime: periods15\u201319 demand = 471,486,429,416,381) so (1+L)-scaled mean/volatility focus on current weekly demand pattern and avoid diluting with much older samples. This balances service (by using an empirically shorter lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized vs earlier weeks. On-hand=0, in-transit=1642 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 2-period arrivals (some 1s); earlier long delays occurred but later evidence (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13) supports using observed average rather than blind default. I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times. Demand shows a sustained lower regime starting Period 14; to reflect this I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=9 covering Periods 14\u201322) so the backend targets stocking for the new lower mean while accounting for current pipeline. This balances service (use observed lead time, keep pipeline in mind) against holding cost by reducing forecasted demand and volatility to the recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 (2019-05-13): avg demand changed from 526.6 (earlier samples) to 389.7 (Periods 14\u201322), a -26% sustained decline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Historical concludes confirm a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 14 (avg ~389.7) vs earlier ~526.6; recent weekly demands (P14\u2013P23) support a lower demand level. Recent lead-time observations include several 2-period arrivals (confirmed P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13), so using promised lead time is appropriate. To align base-stock with the lower post-change demand, forecast demand using the recent regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the last 10 periods (Periods 14\u201323) to capture the new mean/volatility while keeping L at the promised value to let the OR engine use correct (1+L) scaling. This balances service (capture current lower demand) vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Historical concluded lead times observed: 2 (P4), 2 (P8), 1 (P10), 2 (P13) \u2192 average ~1.75; promised lead time=2. Demand regime lowered at Period 14 and recent sample window (Periods 14\u201324) shows sustained lower demand. To respect observed lead-time variability while keeping backend aligned with promised LT, set L by calculation (uses observed average). For demand forecast use recent_N over the confirmed lower-demand regime (Periods 14\u201324) so mu_hat reflects current lower mean; likewise set sigma_hat recent_N to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock from old high-demand regime while accounting for the in-transit pipeline and observed lead-time behavior.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time ~2 (several orders with lead=2 in P4, P8, P13) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 to lower demand. To avoid overstocking while covering review+lead demand, keep L at promised (default=2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-shift regime to reflect the lower, sustained demand: use N=12 (Periods 14\u201325) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from recent lower-demand samples. This reduces target base-stock versus using older high-demand data, balancing service level and holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642 (large pipeline). Historical concluded data show the demand regime dropped at Period 14 and has persisted; use recent demand only. Promised lead time is 2 and recent concluded arrivals are consistent with L=2, so keep default lead time. Use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-Period-14 regime (Periods 14\u201326, 13 samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the current lower-demand regime. This balances service (use regime-specific demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit quantity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Historical concluded messages confirm a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (avg dropped ~26%). Promised lead time=2 and earlier evidence (Period 8) confirmed actual L=2; no new sustained lead-time change since. I therefore keep L as default (promised=2) but base demand forecast on the recent lower-demand regime. I use recent_N=14 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covers Periods 14\u201327, regime_length=14) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant post-changepoint samples\u2014this reduces overstating demand and limits holding cost given large in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Historical concluded lead-time observations show mixed 1\u20132 periods with average ~1.75; early missing arrivals were transient and later confirms match promised L=2. Demand regime shifted down around Period 14; recent demand (Periods 14\u201328) is the most relevant for forecasting. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let the backend average recent confirmed arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (the recent post-changepoint regime length) so the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the lower sustained demand, reducing overstock while covering near-term demand given the large pipeline.

Demand experienced a sustained regime shift at Period 14 (mean dropped ~26%); use recent regime data for demand forecast. Set L via calculate to let backend compute average observed lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat with recent_N using the most recent regime (Periods 14\u201329, regime length 16) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std are built from the last 16 samples, aligning safety stock to current lower-demand regime while accounting for observed lead time delays. This balances service level (use recent demand) against holding cost (avoids inflating forecasts with older higher-demand data).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09): recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 14 (avg \u2248389.7 vs earlier 526.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642 (large pipeline). Promised lead time is 2 and prior conclues confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 8 evidence), so I retain the default promised L to align OR backend with contract lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the sustained lower mean and variance: mu_hat recent_N N=17 (Periods 14\u201330) and sigma_hat recent_N N=17. This focuses forecast on the current lower-demand regime and prevents over-ordering despite a large in-transit pipeline, balancing service level against holding costs.

To be conservative about lead-time uncertainty but use all observed evidence, set L to be calculated from observed lead-times (backend will average). Demand forecast uses the post-shift regime: use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 14\u201331, length 18) so m\xfb reflects lower sustained mean; volatility likewise uses recent_N over the same window so safety stock matches recent variability. This balances service (use recent lower mean) with holding cost given large in-transit position.

Observed concluded lead times = {2,2,1,2} \u2192 use calculated average lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=1642 (large pipeline) so cap will limit orders; using recent demand samples (most recent 19 periods since the regime change) for mu and sigma captures the sustained lower demand and recent variability while letting the OR backend compute base_stock accordingly.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead-times (some early lost arrivals P1\u2013P3, confirmed L=2 in Period 8) so I keep the promised lead time. Demand experienced a sustained downward regime starting Period 14; to align forecasts with the current lower-demand regime I use recent data from that regime. Set L=default (promised=2) to match supplier promise and OR assumptions. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (Periods 14\u201333) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the post-change regime, which reduces overstock risk while preserving service given a large in-transit position.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed: 2,2,1,2 \u2192 average ~1.75) and earlier lost/delayed orders; demand experienced a sustained downward regime from Period 14 (avg fell ~26%). I set L="calculate" so backend infers the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint lower-demand regime (Periods 14\u201334 length=21 \u2192 N capped to 20 per rules), so forecasts and volatility reflect the sustained lower mean and recent variability. This keeps base stock aligned with the confirmed lower demand while L calculated from observed arrives helps the OR engine account for actual lead-time behavior and avoid over/under-ordering given the large in-transit quantity.

Demand dropped at Period 14 and has remained lower \u2014 use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the post-changepoint regime (use max recent window capped at 20). sigma_hat also use recent_N with same window to reflect current volatility. These choices let the OR engine size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods using the recent lower-demand regime while the calculated L captures observed lead-time behavior and guards against underordering given in-transit receipts may be delayed or lost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Historical concluded lead-times show mixed 1\u20132 periods but overall average best captures recent variability; demand history shows a sustained downshift around Period 14 but no new changepoint since. Profit=$4 / unit vs holding=$1 \u2192 q = 4/(4+1)=0.8 so backend will target a high service level. I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times to let the model reflect realized variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default population-wide formulas so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level given the profit/holding tradeoff. Current large in-transit (1642) will be compared to pipeline by the backend when computing order quantity, avoiding unnecessary new orders while covering (1+L) periods of demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 2 periods (Period 8 evidence) though earlier transient delays occurred; no new persistent lead-time change. Demand regime shifted down at Period 14 (avg fell ~26%); recent demand since that regime is most relevant. To avoid overstocking given large in-transit pipeline, keep promised lead time: L=default. Use recent demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets current lower-demand regime and limits extra ordering while pipeline depletes: mu_hat -> recent_N (N=20) capturing latest 20 demands; sigma_hat -> recent_N (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Historical conclues confirm a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (avg dropped ~26%). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Promised lead time=2 and earlier conclues (Period 4 and 8) support using the promised/default lead time. To capture the post-change demand regime I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses most recent data since Period 14 changepoint and the last 20 samples) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility reflecting the lower sustained demand. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times = {2,2,1,2} (mixed but centered near 2); some early long delays occurred but later evidence (Period 8) confirmed 2. Demand has a sustained regime shift around Period 14 and more recent variability\u2014use recent data to forecast. Therefore set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to capture realized behavior; set mu_hat using a recent_N window to reflect post-changepoint demand and recent weeks; set sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect current demand volatility. These choices keep orders sized to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost >0 and profit $4/unit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Recent concluded lead-time evidence (P4, P8, P10) shows primarily 2-period lead time (with occasional 1); use averaged observed lead time. Recent demand (Periods 30\u201340) averages ~423 units/week; demand regime shift at Period 14 already recorded. To align ordering with current realized demand and the pipeline, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 11 demand samples (captures weeks 30\u201340) so the base-stock reflects current demand level while sigma reflects recent volatility. This keeps pipeline + on-hand targeted to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642. Historical conclues show mixed lead times but recent confirmed lead times average < =2 (observed W=2,2,1,2); choose lead-time estimate by calculation. Demand experienced a sustained downshift at Period 14; recent demand since then is the most relevant signal. To reflect the post-Period-14 regime and current variability, use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the last 20 samples. This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=1642 units. Promised L=2; (1+L)=3 periods of demand. Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 14 but a single extreme spike at Period 42 (1366) likely Black Friday. To avoid overreacting to one-week spike while still giving weight to recent demand, keep L as promised and use an EWMA for mu_hat (moderate gamma) so recent observations influence the base-stock but do not fully dominate. Use default sigma_hat to reflect long-run variability. Large in-transit inventory will cap new orders via the OR engine, preventing overstocking.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=2994 (includes P43 order 1352 not yet concluded). Historical data shows a sustained demand decline detected at Period 14 and a previous lead-time confirmation of 2 periods; no new sustained changepoint since the last insights. I choose L=default to trust the promised 2-period lead time (OR backend expects promised L). For demand I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this is conservative given large in-transit inventory (2994) and recent one-off spikes; default stats avoid overreacting to the single large spike in P42 and will let the capped-order logic limit additional receipts. This balances service level and holding cost while awaiting concluded arrivals to confirm lead-time or demand shifts.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=2994 (large pipeline from recent orders). Historical concluded lead-times show a stable actual lead time = 2 periods (confirmed Period 8 arrival pattern); no new sustained lead-time shift. Demand experienced a sustained regime drop starting Period 14 (avg fell ~26%); recent holiday spike at Period 42 (1366) is an outlier. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime while smoothing recent volatility, I use recent_N demand estimates over the most recent 20 samples (captures the post-changepoint regime while limiting influence of single-week outliers). I keep L at default (promised = 2). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=20) gives the OR engine a demand forecast focused on the newer, lower-demand regime and an empirical volatility estimate; this balances service (using updated mean) against holding cost, especially given a large in-transit position.

Demand history shows a sustained lower regime since Period 14 but a one-off large spike in Period 42 (holiday). Given confirmed L=2 and mixed signals (long-term lower mean with a recent holiday spike), use defaults so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014this balances service level during holiday season while leveraging full historical variability and avoids overreacting to a single spike.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent on-hand=856 + in-transit=1642 provides ample coverage vs. weekly demands (historical mean lowered after Period 14). No outstanding overdue shipments visible in concluded history; recent arrivals confirm actual lead time = promised 2 periods (e.g., P43->P45). To keep policy aligned with vendor promise and historical demand statistics (including the sustained post-P14 lower regime already recorded), use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples. This balances service (using observed data) against holding cost given current large on-hand/pipeline position.
