Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean \u2248103.4 units and std \u224810.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=2. No concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time shifts. I use the promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std, yielding a base-stock that balances service level (q=Profit/(Profit+Holding)=4/5) against holding cost while avoiding overreaction to limited recent variability.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~103.4 units/week; on-hand=0, in-transit=123 (order from P1) but no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Promised lead time is 2. Use default lead time (promised) because no concluded arrivals to confirm a different L. Use default mu_hat to anchor forecast to the full-sample mean scaled by (1+L) to cover review+lead period. Use default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes variability from all samples (scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies moderate fill priority) while avoiding overreacting to a single outstanding shipment that has not concluded.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=253; no concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1,P2 still unconfirmed) so cannot infer a lead-time change. Recent demand in conclude messages shows two high-demand periods (125,199) but this is not yet a sustained regime shift vs. historical samples (mean ~103.4). Use promised lead time and historical-demand defaults to avoid overreacting to a short spike. Therefore: L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service (covers L+1 periods) while avoiding excess holding given possible lost/delayed shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=415 (sum of orders: P1=123, P2=130, P3=162). No concluded arrivals for any past orders through Period 3 despite promised lead time=2; this suggests actual lead time is longer or shipments are lost. To be conservative I set L explicit=3 to cover the observed delay. Demand history (5 samples) mean=103.4/wk; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat will scale that mean/variance by (1+L) to produce the base-stock estimate while keeping parameter calculation grounded in full sample history. This increases on-hand target to reduce stockouts given likely longer lead time while letting the OR backend cap orders via its cap formula to limit excess inventory.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (123,130,162; total 415) have produced zero concluded arrivals through Period 3 \u2014 indicates lead time >=3 or lost shipments.

Daily Profit: $360.00, Daily Holding Cost: $40.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $320.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history: Period 4 shows arrival of the Period 2 order with lead_time=2. Some earlier orders remain unconcluded but we have at least one observed lead-time=2, so use calculated lead time. On-hand=40 + in-transit=420 provides pipeline cover; demand has been volatile (125,199,140,90 in P1-4). To bias toward recent demand while remaining conservative on variability, use a recent mean over the last 5 demand samples for mu_hat and default volatility. These settings balance service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=420 (orders from P1-P4 outstanding minus one arrival). Historical sample mean=103.4 units/week. Observed concluded lead time: Period4 shows an arrival of P2 order with lead_time=2 (one observed lead-time =2); P3 order (162) remains missing as of Period5 conclude, indicating shipment delays/losses are possible. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (captures the confirmed 2-period observation without forcing promised lead time). For demand I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this leverages the full historical sample set (mean=103.4) while letting the backend apply the z-service level tradeoff given profit/holding costs. This approach is conservative given uncertain/missing arrivals and keeps orders aligned with observed lead-time evidence.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-03-25: recent demand samples (weeks in history) average ~103.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=420 \u2014 several earlier orders delayed or possibly lost, though Period 4 concluded an arrival that confirms at least one order had lead_time=2. Given limited confirmed lead-time evidence and promised lead time=2, use default lead time to avoid overreacting. Use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine applies the standard base-stock formula grounded in full-sample stats; this balances service-level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overcommitting inventory despite some missing shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent true demand (concluded periods) shows weekly demands: 125,199,140,90,56,99,112 \u2014 recent average ~120 units/week with variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=420 (these are outstanding orders from earlier periods; Period 2 order confirmed lead_time=2 but orders from Periods 1 and 3 remain unconcluded, indicating possible lost/delayed shipments). To protect service while acknowledging missing arrivals, I explicitly lengthen the assumed lead time to 3 to be conservative. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the replenishment on the most recent 7 demand observations (captures current demand level and volatility despite earlier stockouts). These choices increase target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand and raise safety stock from recent variability, trading higher holding cost for improved fill given shipment uncertainty.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent history: on-hand=0, in-transit=545; observed one concluded arrival: Period4 shows order from Period2 arrived with lead_time=2. Earlier orders (P1,P3) remain unconcluded and may be delayed/lost, but only one clear lead-time observation exists. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures the confirmed 2-period observation). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u2014 conservative given limited recent data and possible lost shipments. This balances service (accounting for confirmed L=2) versus holding cost by not overreacting to in-transit volume that may include lost or very delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: P2 order arrived P4)

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history confirms at least one order with actual lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4). On-hand=0, in-transit=545 (many earlier orders not concluded \u2014 possible lost shipments). Use lead-time inference based on observed conclusions (calculate average observed lead times) to be conservative and align promised 2-period setting with evidence. For demand forecast use default long-run sample-based estimates (no strong, sustained demand regime change detected across available samples). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Demand history shows earlier weekly samples (Jan) and recent realized demands through Period 10. Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed P2->P4, P8->P10). Current on-hand=38, in-transit=420 which provides substantial pipeline cover. Promised lead time is 2 and recent evidence supports using promised/default. To let the OR backend compute base stock from long-run sample moments while recognizing sufficient pipeline, I select default methods so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level (profit/holding ratio) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 2 (P2->P4, P8->P10). On-hand=0, in-transit=420 (pipeline present). Because we have confirmed observed lead-times, set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture that evidence. Use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend uses full historical demand base adjusted for the review+lead horizon; this balances service (use observed L) versus holding cost given substantial pipeline and some past missing arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead time = 2 (P2->P4, P8->P10), so actual LT matches promised. Pipeline (420) provides substantial cover versus recent weekly demand (~85-140). I select L by 'calculate' (use observed lead times average = 2) and use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full history. This keeps forecasting anchored to all available samples while the confirmed LT reduces lead-time risk and avoids overreacting to short recent demand fluctuations.

On-hand=0, in-transit=420 \u2014 ample pipeline to cover (1+L) periods. Use default promised lead time to keep OR engine alignment; use default demand/volatility (all-sample statistics) since no clear changepoint or seasonal spike requiring recent-window or explicit forecast. This keeps orders conservative given holding cost and large existing in-transit volume.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concluded arrivals show two clear lead-time observations (P2\u2192P4 and P8\u2192P10), both =2 periods so I use calculate for L to let backend confirm average=2. Demand history (multiple periods around ~90\u2013145, historical sample mean ~103) shows no sustained recent regime shift, so use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat (backend will scale (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These settings keep the OR model centered on historical demand while the calculate L captures confirmed lead-time=2; this balances service (using observed LT) against holding cost given holding/profit ratio.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent observed weekly demand (Periods 12-16) averages ~107 units/week with variability and a recent spike (Period 15=145). On-hand=0, in-transit=420 \u2014 significant pipeline available covering multiple weeks. Historical conclude messages show observed lead times = 2 periods (P2->P4, P8->P10); earlier missing arrivals were resolved, so use observed average lead time. Set L via calculate to reflect confirmed observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the current regime (including the recent spike) and to scale over the review+lead horizon (1+L). This balances service (capture recent higher demand) while the large in-transit reduces urgency of very aggressive ordering.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 for observed arrivals (P2\u2192P4, P8\u2192P10) though early Periods 1\u20133 orders never concluded (possible lost shipments). On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Given confirmed lead time evidence and no sustained recent demand regime shift (historical weekly demand samples remain similar), use promised lead time and population-wide demand estimates so OR backend applies its calibrated base-stock. This balances service (use L=promised=2) versus holding cost given moderate in-transit inventory; defaults let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples while respecting its cap on order size.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). SKU 179123001 (leggings). Profit $4, Holding $1. On-hand 0, in-transit 420. Historical conclude messages show two confirmed arrivals with lead_time=2 (P4: P2\u2192P4; P10: P8\u2192P10) so actual lead time is 2. Earlier gaps (Periods 1-3 orders) suggested possible lost/delayed shipments, but more recent evidence supports L=2. Use L calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed evidence. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from demand samples) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost given the chosen L and provided profit/holding costs. Pipeline (420 units) is large relative to typical weekly demand, so no explicit upward adjustment to mu/sigma is made.

Many earlier periods had no arrivals, suggesting some upstream shipment issues, but confirmed arrivals indicate actual lead time = 2. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time (2). Demand estimates use 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and 'default' volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap from the full sample mean/std; this balances service (using confirmed lead time) vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Earlier gaps (no arrivals from P1\u2013P3) could reflect lost/delayed shipments but later confirmations indicate actual lead time = 2. I therefore set L via calculate (use observed lead times average) to capture confirmed lead time=2.

I set L to 'calculate' so backend computes average observed lead time (reflecting the confirmed 2-period lead). Demand has varied recently; using the last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 17-21: 63,86,121,49,82) captures the current regime without over-weighting older seasonality. I choose recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples, and recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting near-term demand under the confirmed 2-period lead while avoiding excessive holding cost given limited on-hand stock and substantial in-transit pipeline.

Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand history (multiple weeks of ~50\u2013145) shows no sustained regime shift versus earlier samples; lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods from concluded history. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 420 \u2014 substantial pipeline exists but arrivals are subject to the 1-period observe delay. I select default lead time (use promised L=2 as backend expects) and default demand stats so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history. This conservative choice leverages the confirmed lead time and lets the OR engine size base-stock against observed mean/variance while respecting caps; it avoids overreacting to recent noise or transient missing arrivals.

No sustained demand regime change detected across historical periods; demand has varied but shows no clear persistent shift. To let the OR engine use full historical stats and the promised lead time (which matches observed), use default lead time and default demand estimates so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances service (profit/holding ratio) while letting OR engine account for estimated lead time and historical variability. This approach is conservative given potential lost shipments: we rely on backend pipeline adjustment rather than artificially inflating forecasts here.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has averaged moderate weekly volumes (many weeks of nonzero demand since Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=420 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand so avoid inflating lead-time or demand forecasts. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 (observed P2\u2192P4 and P8\u2192P10). I therefore set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed behavior, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (keeps forecast anchored to full history while respecting L). This balances service level (profit/holding ratio = 4/(4+1)=0.8 \u2192 high target fill) with holding cost by not over-explicitly increasing mean or variance given substantial in-transit inventory and no new sustained demand regime shift.

Use L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (matches promised 2). Use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so backend computes demand across (1+L) periods from historical samples; this provides a neutral prior while the confirmed lead-time is enforced. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overfitting short-term noise; large in-transit stock already mitigates immediate stockouts.

No sustained demand regime shift detected; use default demand estimates so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the OR backend using the promised lead time estimate supported by concluded evidence and baseline demand stats; it balances service level (capturing 1+L periods of demand) against holding cost given moderate holding penalty relative to profit.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=420 \u2014 pipeline is substantial relative to recent low demand. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (observed P2->P4, P8->P10). Demand has shifted down since early spring (weekly demands mostly in 50\u201390 range for many recent periods). To reflect the lower recent demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility with N=20 (captures the last 20 demand observations, balancing recency with sample size). Keep L as default (promised 2), since concluded evidence matches promised lead time. These choices bias the OR base-stock lower than long-run averages to avoid excess holding cost given persistent low recent demand while the large in-transit position already provides coverage for upcoming periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent weekly demand has settled at a low summer level (last 5 demands: 58,52,50,49,65; mean\u224854.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=420 (pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 in prior observations (P2\u2192P4, P8\u2192P10). I therefore keep L as promised (default=2) and forecast demand using the most recent regime: mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower mean ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). Volatility also set from the same recent window (sigma_hat recent_N N=5). These choices focus the OR engine on the current low-demand regime while the large in-transit position limits further orders via the cap, reducing holding costs.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concluded messages show actual lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 9 evidence) though early Periods 1-3 had missing arrivals; current pipeline (420) likely includes valid in-transit. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (2) because later concluded evidence confirms lead time=2. Demand has moved down recently vs. early-year highs; I detect a recent lower-demand regime in the last 5 periods (Periods 27-31: 52,50,49,65,43; mean ~51.8). To capture the recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand based on the latest pattern, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service given current pipeline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. Recent demand history (samples from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows weekly demands used as baseline; no sustained upward seasonal shift detected. On-hand=0, in-transit=420 \u2014 in-transit likely covers multiple future periods but earlier missing arrivals (Periods 1-3) flagged possible lost shipments; however concluded arrivals (P2->P4 and P8->P10) confirm actual observed lead time \u22482. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (reflecting the confirmed 2-period behavior). For demand parameters I choose 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this uses full historical data given no clear regime change. These settings balance service level vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the base-stock and cap using the profit/holding ratio and the full-sample statistics while respecting inferred lead time from concluded arrivals.

I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (reflecting confirmed LT=2).

Pipeline (420) is substantial vs recent weekly demand (typically ~50\u2013120). To let the OR backend use its historical statistics and promised lead time while accounting for standard safety stock calculation, I select default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to intermittent missing arrivals and leverages provided profit/holding tradeoff in the base-stock formula.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (orders from P2\u2192P4 and P8\u2192P10). Earlier missing arrivals (orders in P1\u2013P3) suggest possible lost shipments then, but recent evidence shows stable L=2. Use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed observations. Use default demand estimates (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across full history; this balances service level given in-transit stock while avoiding over-adjusting to recent zero-stock periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (observed P2\u2192P4, P8\u2192P10). On-hand=0, in-transit=420 (sufficient upcoming supply vs. expected demand). No sustained demand regime change detected in historical weekly series. To be conservative and consistent with observed lead time, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this leverages all data and lets the OR engine cap order size given the current pipeline, avoiding over-ordering while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (e.g., P2\u2192P4, P8\u2192P10) and there have been long stretches of zero arrivals for some earlier orders but no new sustained lead-time shift. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the base-stock calculation balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost automatically. This preserves service-level targeting while avoiding unnecessary extra inventory given existing in-transit stock.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (Period 4 & Period 10 evidence). Earlier missing arrivals (Periods 1-3 orders) appear to have been resolved or are not currently producing a persistent longer lead time signal. To remain consistent with confirmed observations and avoid over-correcting, use the promised/confirmed lead time (default). Demand history is noisy but shows no recent sustained regime shift; use default population estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the sizable in-transit (420) will be reconciled by the backend pipeline subtraction, limiting excess ordering and balancing service vs. holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent observed demand (last ~10 weeks) is substantially lower than early-year levels; on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods in past concluded messages (e.g., P2\u2192P4), so use promised/default L to align with supplier. To avoid overstocking given low recent demand I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base stock and cap from a downstream forecast reflecting current lower mean (~69 units/week) and current volatility. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (observed P2\u2192P4). No new sustained demand regime change detected. I select default L (use promised lead time=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history, respects the confirmed lead time, and lets the backend balance high service (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost given current pipeline of 420 units.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead_time=2 (e.g., P2\u2192P4, P8\u2192P10); earlier gaps likely were lost shipments but later evidence confirms L=2. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times. Demand forecast and volatility use 'default' ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) to leverage full history and avoid overreacting to earlier missing arrivals; this balances service level (profit/HoldingCost ratio) against holding costs given large in-transit inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent history shows no sustained demand regime shift since early samples and lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=420 (pipeline substantial). Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep model aligned with observed arrivals and keep demand estimates based on all historical samples to avoid overreacting to weekly noise. Default mu/sigma use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples so OR backend computes base-stock consistent with long-run demand; this balances service level (profit/holding gives high target service level) while avoiding extra inventory layering given large in-transit stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand shows elevated and volatile December weeks (Period 42=208, Period 45=181) so use a short recent window to capture current regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=420 (useful pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show consistent 2-period arrivals (e.g., P2->P4, P8->P10), so use calculated lead time based on observed lead times. Select recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility to capture the holiday uplift and short-term variance; this balances service (higher mu_hat) versus holding cost by limiting the window. No explicit handling of lost shipments here because recent concludes confirm L\u22482 and in-transit exists.
