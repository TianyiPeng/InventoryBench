{
  "rationale": "Observation & lead-time: Promised lead time = 2. We have no on-hand and no in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to contradict promised lead time. Therefore plan must cover current period demand plus the next L periods (L+1 = 3 periods).\nDemand analysis: Historical samples show a clear upward trend: 2019-01-07:59, 2019-01-14:78, 2019-01-21:96, 2019-01-28:123, 2019-02-04:144. The most recent 3-week average = (96+123+144)/3 = 121 units/week. The earlier 2-week average = (59+78)/2 = 68.5 units/week, so recent demand is materially higher and appears sustained over 3 weeks.\nOR recommendation: OR suggested 157 units using its capped base-stock (it relies on promised L and full history). With zero pipeline, OR's 157 would likely understock given the recent upward shift.\nDecision logic & final quantity: I size the order to cover approximately 3 periods of demand given the inferred regime: target = (L+1) * recent single-period mean \u2248 3 * 121 = 363. To balance holding cost risk against the clear upward trend, I moderate but significantly increase OR's recommendation and order 300 units now (covers ~2.5 weeks at recent demand; substantially reduces stockout risk versus 157 while limiting excess holding).\nAction justification: With no pipeline and rapidly rising demand, ordering 300 units is a proactive response to confirmed demand increase while still conservative relative to a full 3-period cover of 363 units.",
