Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or observed lead-times yet. Use promised lead time and historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04: mean weekly demand=97.2) to set default demand and volatility for the (review+lead) horizon. This keeps parameters conservative given zero inventory and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=172 (order placed P1); P1 conclude shows arrived=0 which is consistent with promised lead time\u22651 \u2014 no evidence of lost shipment or lead-time change. Historical demand samples span early Jan\u2013Feb (mean ~97.2/week). With no sustained changepoint and promised lead time=2, use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean and std. This balances service (covers L+1 periods) while avoiding over-reacting to a single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand 0, in-transit 335 (orders placed P1=172, P2=163) but no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time is 2 and there is insufficient concluded evidence to change it, so keep L=default. Recent demand appears elevated (P1 demand=91, P2=151 vs historical mean ~97). To capture the most recent regime while respecting the minimum sample rule, use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 3 observed demands: 2019-02-04=133, P1=91, P2=151). This increases target stock to cover the short-run demand uptick while keeping lead-time assumption unchanged; in-transit inventory of 335 will be reconciled when arrivals conclude.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=463 (orders placed in P1\u2013P3). Conclude history shows no arrivals for P1 (ordered=172), P2 (163), P3 (128) \u2014 suggesting delayed/lost shipments but not enough definitive lead-time confirmation. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend assumes L=2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical weekly samples (Jan 2019 series) to keep forecast anchored to baseline demand while avoiding overfitting to noisy recent zeros caused by missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed P1=172, P2=163, P3=128 had arrived=0 in Period 1\u20133 concludes (no arrivals observed by Period 3 conclude); possible lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Profit: $1102.00, Daily Holding Cost: $105.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $997.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand samples (5 weeks) have mean ~97.2/wk. Current inventory: on-hand=105, in-transit=300; one earlier order (P2) confirmed arrived with lead_time=2, P1 and P3 remained missing until P4 conclude (possible lost/delayed). I set L=calculate to use the observed lead times (avg of observed = 2) so the OR engine uses realized lead-time evidence rather than the promised value. For demand I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from all historical samples \u2014 this keeps forecasts anchored to the available historical series while the lead-time adjustment addresses recent delivery irregularity and balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=4, in-transit=300. History shows one concluded arrival indicating actual lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4); some earlier orders were delayed/lost but P2 confirms LT=2. Given this, set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect real behavior. Demand history (Jan\u2013Feb samples + recent periods) shows weekly mean ~97; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing base-stock covering review+lead demand. This balances service (use observed LT=2) against holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and profit ($19).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (P2 order placed Period 2 arrived Period 4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=394. History shows a confirmed lead time of 2 (P2\u2192P4) and earlier missing arrivals (P1,P3) suggesting some lost shipments but not enough evidence to change promised lead time. Recent realized demand (Periods 4-6) = [58,101,64], mean \u224874.33, below long-run sample mean (97.2). To be responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while preserving service given the 2-period lead, set L using observed data and set demand forecast based on the last 3 weeks. Chosen methods: L="calculate" to use observed lead-time average (captures the confirmed 2); mu_hat="recent_N", N=3 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on recent demand (reduces overstating orders given drop); sigma_hat="recent_N", N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (uses recent demand) against holding cost and accounts for potential lost shipments by not inflating lead time unnecessarily.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent realized weekly demand has been moderate (last 5 demands: 79,58,101,64,59; mean\u224872) after earlier volatile weeks. On-hand=0, in-transit=394 (covers multiple future periods). Observed concluded lead times: one clear observation (P2\u2192P4) \u2192 lead time=2. Some earlier orders (P1,P3) remain missing but no new sustained delay pattern since a 2-period arrival was observed. To keep the OR engine responsive to the recent demand regime while using confirmed lead-time evidence, set L by calculate (uses observed lead times average =2), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the last-5-week mean across the review+lead period, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching forecast to recent demand while relying on confirmed lead-time data so ordering neither overstocks nor risks stockouts given the large in-transit balance.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=48, in-transit=300. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8). Recent demand has declined since early March; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 4\u20138) show a lower regime. To be robust to the confirmed LT=2 and to reflect the recent lower demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 periods) so the OR backend will target a base stock appropriate for the new lower mean while accounting for variability over those 5 periods. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) vs holding cost given profit $19 and holding $1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 4: average demand Periods 1\u20133 = 107 (91,151,79) vs Periods 4\u20138 = 66.8 (58,101,64,59,46), decrease \u2248 -37.6%; sustained for 5 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has been in the lower regime starting Period 4 (sustained drop ~ -38%). Observed arrivals show confirmed lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8) and some earlier lost shipments (P1,P3 never arrived). Current on-hand=22, in-transit=300 \u2014 ample pipeline but includes past delayed shipments. I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times (2) to reflect confirmed behavior. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (last 6 periods covering the sustained lower-demand regime) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to the current lower mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given large in-transit inventory.

To reduce holding cost while preserving service, keep L at promised (default) and set demand forecast using recent data (last 5 weeks) to reflect the sustained lower regime; use recent volatility (last 5) for sigma to capture current variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained ~66.8 avg through Period 11). Observed lead times (concluded) are consistently 2 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=300 (large pipeline from earlier orders) \u2014 avoid inflating targets. I set L by calculate (uses observed lead times = 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 4\u201311 regime length=8) so mu_hat reflects the lower sustained demand and prevents over-ordering given the large in-transit. sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=8 to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize matching ordering to the confirmed lower-demand regime and the confirmed lead time, reducing holding cost risk while preserving service given existing pipeline.

Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (observed P2->P4, P6->P8) and a sustained demand drop beginning Period 4 (lower regime). Use promised lead time (default L=2). For demand forecast use recent regime data: take recent_N=9 (Periods 4\u201312) to capture the lowered mean/volatility while including the last 9 periods of evidence. This keeps (1+L)-period demand forecast aligned to the confirmed lower-demand regime and ensures pipeline + on-hand (300) is compared against a 3-period demand forecast to avoid overstock given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 4 (lower demand) and lead time confirmed as 2 periods by observed arrivals (P2->P4, P6->P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=300 \u2014 pipeline appears sufficient vs. recent lower-demand regime but overdue/lost shipments were observed earlier so rely only on concluded lead-time evidence. I set L using calculated average of observed lead times (confirmed = 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 4\u201313) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (using recent lower demand) while avoiding overstock given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Demand shows a sustained lower regime since Period 4 (previously recorded), so I use recent demand to set forecasts. Set L to calculate (uses observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to make the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the current lower-demand regime and recent variability; this reduces overstock risk given large in-transit volume and low holding cost vs profit.

Several earlier orders were missing but recent concludes confirm 2-period lead time. Demand has been lower since Period 4 (sustained regime); use recent demand window to capture the lower regime and reduce overstock while using calculated L to reflect observed lead time. Parameters chosen: L=calculate to use observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=12) to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent low-demand regime, aligning service level to profit/holding tradeoff while acknowledging in-transit stock.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical concluded lead-time observations: two confirmed arrivals showing lead_time=2 (P2->P4, P6->P8). Demand shows sustained lower regime starting Period 4; recent regime length = 13 samples (Periods 4\u201316) with higher variance (two 90s) but lower mean vs pre-periods. To be conservative given confirmed lead time=2 and a sustained lower-demand regime, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 (captures current regime mean and volatility). This keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) periods of the currently observed lower demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff; existing large in-transit (300) will be reconciled by the engine vs pipeline, avoiding new over-ordering.

To reflect confirmed lead time we ask the backend to calculate average observed lead time. For demand we use a recent_N estimate over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 4\u201317) to capture the sustained lower mean and recent variability; same recent_N window for sigma to align service-level sizing with current volatility. This balances service (use recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock and prior missing shipments.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical concludes show actual observed lead times = 2 (P2->P4, P6->P8); earlier P1/P3 showed no arrival and may be lost but two confirmed arrivals give consistent LT=2. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained low demand through Periods 4\u201318). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture confirmed LT=2. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (covers the sustained low-demand regime from Period 4 to now) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean_recent and volatility based on recent variability; this reduces over-ordering for the new lower-demand regime while respecting the observed lead time and the large in-transit quantity.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent sustained demand drop began Period 4 and persists through Period 19; using recent regime data avoids bias from early high weeks. On-hand=0, in-transit=300 which provides coverage vs. forecasted (L+1) periods but some early orders were lost so rely on observed concludes for lead-time. Set L based on observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use recent_N over the detected low-demand regime (Periods 4\u201319, N=16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service appropriate to the lower demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded lead-times observed = 2 periods (arrivals: P2->P4, P6->P8) despite earlier missing shipments; therefore set L by averaging observed lead times. To capture the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the entire post-changepoint regime (Periods 4\u201320, N=17) so the OR base-stock reflects the lower mean and volatility and avoids excess holdings given holding cost= $1 vs profit=$19.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical concludes show confirmed actual lead time = 2 (P2->P4, P6->P8). Earlier missing shipments were observed but lead time has been validated as 2 for later arrivals. Demand dropped materially starting Period 4 and has remained lower through Period 21 (sustained regime). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time (captures confirmed 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 to reflect the post-change lower-demand regime (Periods 4\u201321 \u2248 18 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean and volatility and avoid being pulled up by the earlier high-demand periods. This balances service level (capture reduced but persistent demand) vs holding cost given holding cost is low but persistent. No new confirmed lost-shipment pattern beyond prior insights.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 4; recent observed demand (Periods 4\u201322) is consistently lower than early periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=300 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to current low-demand regime, suggesting we should forecast using the recent low-demand regime. No new lead-time evidence; keep promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=2). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent low-demand regime (N=19 periods, Periods 4\u201322) so the OR engine targets service appropriate to the lower demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost and large in-transit inventory. This also accounts conservatively for earlier missing shipments by relying on confirmed arrivals and recent sustained low demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has remained in the lower regime since Period 4 (sustained drop), current on-hand=0 with large in-transit=300 units (risk of excess). Past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2. To avoid over-ordering while reflecting the sustained lower demand, set lead time by averaging observed lead times and forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (use 20 most recent periods of the regime). Volatility also set from the same recent window so the OR backend will target service while capping order size given the large pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=300. Historical concluded lead time evidence confirms actual L=2 (observed P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained). To avoid overstocking given large in-transit and lower recent demand, keep promised lead time (default) but compute demand forecast from the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (covering the most recent sustained low-demand periods) so the backend bases base-stock on the current lower mean and volatility; this reduces ordering aggressiveness while respecting pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4; recent periods show some volatility with a spike (Period25=78). To capture the recent demand level while remaining robust to variability, I set L to default (promised 2). I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 10 demand samples \u2014 this weights the sustained lower regime while including the recent spike. This keeps target base-stock conservative given the large in-transit position and low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=300 (unconfirmed arrivals in conclude history). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=2 (evidence: P2->P4, P6->P8). Demand regime shifted down starting Period 4 (sustained). I set L=calculate to use observed lead-time average (captures confirmed LT=2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained lower-demand regime (use last 20 samples of demand to reflect post-changepoint behavior). This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given reduced demand and low holding cost.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (observed P2\u2192P4); earlier missing shipments occurred but lead time evidence since Period 6 is stable. Demand has a sustained lower regime since Period 4 (recorded earlier). I will use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility (use all historical samples) so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/std and the promised lead time, letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost given observed regime and available in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=301 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-time observations confirm 2-period deliveries; no sustained multi-period lead-time drift recently. Recent demand has risen in the last 5 periods (Periods 24\u201328 = 26,78,70,130,130) so I bias mu_hat toward the most recent regime. Choose L=default (use promised 2), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent uptick, and sigma_hat=default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps ordering responsive to the recent demand rise while relying on the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=379 \u2014 large pipeline but many past periods showed delayed/missing arrivals; earlier history confirmed actual lead time = 2. Recent demand is variable with occasional spikes (e.g. Periods 27\u201328 demands 130) but no clear new sustained regime change beyond previously recorded shift. To be conservative I will use the promised lead time and the backend's default demand estimates so the OR engine applies its calibrated base-stock and cap rules using all available historical samples. This balances service-level (covering (1+L) periods) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and demand variability.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=378. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 2 periods (confirmed arrivals: P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P28\u2192P30). Demand has shown earlier sustained downshift (Period 4\u20138 regime) but recent weeks are volatile (large spikes P27,P30) and not yet a confirmed new regime. Given confirmed lead time=2 and no robust new demand regime, use default estimators so the OR backend applies its (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the historical samples. This balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) without overreacting to recent noisy spikes. In-transit inventory (378) plus upcoming arrivals should cover demand over the lead horizon; no new lost-shipment signal strong enough to change L.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=378 (large pipeline). Recent history shows a clear demand uptick starting Period 27 (spike cluster in Periods 27\u201331). Confirmed observed lead times = 2 (multiple concluded arrivals). To capture the recent high-demand regime while letting the OR engine use observed lead time, set L via calculate (use observed lead times). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods, captures the new high-demand regime: demands 130,130,58,242,217). This raises forecasted (1+L)-period demand and volatility to reduce stockouts given strong recent demand, while the backend cap will limit extreme orders to control holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 27: avg Periods 4\u201326 = 45.26 vs Periods 27\u201331 = 155.40 (+244%), sustained for 5 periods.

Recent sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 27: Periods 27\u201332 demands = [130,130,58,242,217,205], avg \u2248163.7 over 6 periods. Lead time has been confirmed as 2 in prior conclues and promised lead time=2; keep default L. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat (N=6) and recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6). This biases the backend forecast to (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility to reduce stockouts during the elevated-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity will moderate actual ordering via the OR cap.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand very high since Period 27 (demands: P27\u2013P33 = 130,130,58,242,217,205,374). On-hand=0, in-transit=689 (large pipeline from recent orders). Lead time has repeatedly observed 2 periods (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P28\u2192P30). There is a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 27 (regime length = 7), so I use recent_N=7 to estimate demand (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the backend targets the higher demand level; I keep L as promised (default) since observed lead time equals promised 2 and missing older shipments have since been reconciled. This balances service (meet large recent demand) vs holding cost by basing forecasts on the confirmed high-demand regime.

Demand materially shifted up starting Period 27 (Periods 27\u201334 show sustained high demand; regime length = 8). To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (uses last 8 demand samples) so the OR backend targets a higher base stock while keeping L default; sigma_hat recent_N ensures variability reflects the recent spike. No evidence of additional lost shipments since late arrivals consistent with L=2.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 27 (periods 27\u201335: 9 samples, avg \u2248 215/week) and mixed observed lead times (observed arrivals imply lead times 2,2,2,3). On-hand=38, in-transit=604 (large pipeline). I set L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures occasional 3-period realizations vs promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (covering the high-demand regime from Period 27\u201335) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent high-demand samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=9 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. This balances service (higher forecast during the sustained spike) while the large in-transit plus capped order policy will limit excessive fresh orders and holding cost exposure.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent history shows a clear high-demand regime starting Period 27 (avg \u2248155/wk) and large in-transit position (798 units) from recent orders. Observed lead times are variable (observed: 2,2,2,3,3,1), so use calculated average lead time to let backend smooth variability. Forecast demand using the most recent regime (Periods 27\u201336) to capture the sustained uplift; choose recent_N with N=10 (regime length=10). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These settings prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand regime while the backend caps orders using its cap formula and the large in-transit reduces additional ordering risk.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in a high regime since Period 27 (sustained spikes: Periods 27\u201337 many weeks >> historical baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=856 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are mixed (recent observed W sequence most recent arrivals: 1,3,3,2,2,2). I use recent_N for L (N=5) to capture the most recent lead-time mix (avg ~2.4) rather than the promised 2 to be conservative about variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=11) to capture the sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 27 (use the last 11 demand samples to forecast (1+L)-period demand). Sigma_hat set to recent_N (N=11) to reflect volatility in the same recent high-demand window. These choices bias the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts during the confirmed high-demand regime while using recent lead-time data to account for delivery variability; large in-transit reduces immediate order need but forecasted mu_hat covers (1+L) periods of elevated demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 27 (large demands Periods 27\u201338) and highly variable observed lead times (observed W = 2,2,2,3,3,1). On-hand=0, in-transit=798 \u2014 substantial pipeline that the OR engine should offset against forecast. I set L=calculate so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures variability vs promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (covers Periods 27\u201338 high-demand regime length \u224812) so mu_hat targets the current high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias base stock upward to meet the sustained elevated demand while using observed lead-time average to temper expectations about arrivals and reduce stockouts given in-transit exposure.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 27 (large weekly demands through Period 39) and multiple observed 3-period lead times in the last arrivals. On-hand=63, in-transit=581 provides substantial pipeline coverage. I set L explicitly to 3 because we have three confirmed 3-period arrivals (P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (regime from Period 27\u201339, length=13) so mu_hat reflects the current high-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=13 to capture recent volatility. These choices align base-stock to current elevated demand while accounting for the longer confirmed lead time and existing pipeline to balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: P32 order arrived P35; P33\u2192P36; P36\u2192P39).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=903. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time \u22483 periods (arrivals: P32\u2192P35, P33\u2192P36, P36\u2192P39). Recent demand regime (starting P27) is elevated (sustained high weekly sales P27\u2013P40). To ensure pipeline covers the (lead time + review) window and avoid stockouts while many units are in-transit, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (last 5 weeks) and its volatility so the OR engine raises base stock appropriately without overreacting to older low-demand periods. This balances service (profit per unit $19) against holding cost $1/unit/period given large pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent concluded lead times vary (observed sequence of concluded lt: 2,2,2,3,3,1,3,2) \u2014 recent average ~2.4 so use a short recent window. Demand has shifted to a high regime starting Period 27 (sustained); use a recent demand window covering that regime to capture elevated mean and volatility. Chosen methods: L by recent_N N=5 to reflect the most recent lead-time mix; mu_hat by recent_N N=15 to produce (1+L)*mean over the recent high-demand regime; sigma_hat by recent_N N=15 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than long-run low-demand history.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 27\u201332 (large demands: P30\u2013P42 many >150, including P42=690) and multiple confirmed long lead-time observations (several 3-period arrivals observed; missing/delayed shipments earlier). To protect service during this high-demand regime and account for observed longer deliveries, set lead time explicitly to 3. Use recent_N demand estimates to capture the new high-demand regime (use N=16 to cover the recent ~Period27\u201342 window). Apply the same recent_N horizon for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base stock to meet elevated demand and incorporate observed delivery delays, reducing stockouts while accepting higher holding cost during this high-demand period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 27 (carry-over: avg \u2248155 since P27) and multiple observed lead times (1\u20133 periods). On-hand=166 and large in-transit=1020; some shipments confirmed with 3-period lead time in recent months. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20133 observations). For demand I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime (use last 17 periods from the changepoint at P27 \u2192 N=17 per regime_length rule). sigma_hat uses recent_N with same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base stock toward meeting the sustained higher demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock using observed lead-time average and recent demand variance, reducing stockouts despite in-transit uncertainty.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 27 with several very large weeks in Sep\u2013Dec and confirmed longer actual lead times (recent observed lead_time = 3). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 1020 (pipeline is large but arrivals have been delayed historically). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead-time confirmations (avoid under-ordering from assuming promised L=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the clear, recent high-demand regime (Periods 40\u201344 demands: 189,213,690,156,249) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7the recent mean and adapts quickly to the holiday spike. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to capture increased volatility in these weeks. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to meet elevated holiday demand while using recent data to avoid over-reacting to older low-demand periods; explicit L=3 mitigates lost/delayed arrivals risk given recent 3-period lead times.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=203, in-transit=1223. Observed lead times have varied (2 and 3 periods); recent history shows mixed 2\u20133 with an average >2, so use backend 'calculate' to infer average observed lead time. Demand has jumped since Period 32 and recent weeks are high (Periods 41\u201345 demands = 213,690,156,249,257); I use a recent_N=5 forecast to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine raises base stock and accounts for recent volatility. This balances service (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) by increasing target stock during the sustained high-demand regime while letting backend compute observed lead time.
