Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u2248130.8 units/week; no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals (no evidence of lead-time deviation or lost shipments). Promised lead time is 2 and there are no observed lead-time samples to contradict it. To provide a balanced service level while avoiding excess holding, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full-sample mean and std scaled for (1+L). This keeps parameters conservative until we observe concluded arrivals or a sustained demand shift.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18): on-hand=0, in-transit=166 (ordered Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). Promised lead time=2; absence of arrival is expected until Period 3 conclude, so no evidence of lost shipment or lead-time change. Use default lead time to keep backend aligned with promised L. Demand history (five weekly samples Jan 2019) will be used by backend default formulas for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Profit/holding (4/1) implies a high service quantile; letting OR engine apply its base-stock formula balances service vs holding costs.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent weekly demands: 163, 127, 0 observed sales due to zero on-hand. Pipeline = 340 (ordered 166+174) with no concluded arrivals yet; cannot confirm actual lead time or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) because there is no concluded arrival evidence to calculate a different L. Demand forecast and safety stock will use historical samples (default methods) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service vs holding cost given limited data and uncertain arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~130.8/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=436 equals cumulative outstanding orders (166+174+96). No concluded arrivals have been observed yet, so no evidence that actual lead time differs from the promised 2 periods or that demand regime has shifted. To avoid overreacting to in-transit but unconcluded shipments, use the promised lead time and default demand estimators so the OR engine computes base-stock from the long-run sample mean and variability. This balances service (using full-sample mean scaled by (1+L)) versus holding cost given the existing large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $271.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded history shows a confirmed actual lead time of 2 (Period4: order placed P2 arrived P4). On-hand=85, in-transit=262; pipeline plus on-hand covers several review+lead periods. Demand history (historical samples mean \u2248130.8) shows no sustained upward regime change\u2014recent concluded weekly demand has been 163,127,91,89 but not a 3+ period sustained shift. Therefore use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs holding cost without overreacting to short-term noise.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period4 conclude: 174 units arrived ordered on Period2)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent observed weekly demand: Period4=89, Period5=113; historical sample mean=130.8 (5 weeks from Jan\u2013Feb). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 (covers multiple weeks). Prior conclude confirms lead time = 2. I choose L=default (use promised 2) since confirmed; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures long-run demand signal of 130.8 while accounting for review+lead); sigma_hat=default to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This conservative choice avoids overreacting to two lower recent weeks and lets the OR backend cap orders using its cap\u2014balancing service level given in-transit stock against holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=341, profit=$4/unit, holding=$1/unit/period. Observed concluded lead times: order on P2 arrived at P4 (LT=2); order on P5 arrived at P6 (LT=1) => use 'calculate' to average observed lead times (captures variability). Recent demand has softened vs older samples (recent demands: P2-6 = 127,91,89,113,78) so use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to reflect the current lower-demand regime; use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the recent lower demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability, reducing overstock risk given holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=341. Historical concludes show mixed lead-times: a confirmed 2-period arrival (P2\u2192P4) and one 1-period arrival (P5\u2192P6). Demand has recently moved from ~120s (early samples) down to ~70-115 in the last 7 periods. To be adaptive I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times (lets backend average observed values). For demand I focus on the most recent regime (last 5 demand observations) using recent_N so mu_hat reflects current lower demand; same recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices balance service (using recent demand to avoid overstock) while letting the backend incorporate estimated safety stock given profit/holding costs and the computed lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=262. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4), 1 (P6), 2 (P8) => recent average ~1.67; use recent_N over last 3 observed lead times to capture this mix. Demand has moved down from Jan highs (~130s) to recent weeks; recent 5-week demand (P4-P8 = 89,113,78,75,98) avg ~90.6. Use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast to the new lower regime and recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock tuned to current lower demand while accounting for lead-time variability and limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent realized lead times = [2,1,2] (avg 1.67) so I use recent_N for L to capture variability. Recent demand (last 6 periods: 89,113,78,75,98,63) averages 86 units \u2014 a sustained drop versus earlier sample mean (~130.8). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new lower demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=295 >> expected (1+L)*mu, so parameters prioritize matching current lower demand and avoid excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: avg demand declined from 130.8 (Jan sample) to 86.0 over most recent 6 periods (-34%).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has fallen vs. Jan baseline (Period10 insight: recent 6-period avg = 86, -34%). On-hand=0, in-transit=262 -> substantial pipeline that will cover multiple upcoming periods but arrivals have shown variability (observed lead times 2,1,2,1). Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 realized). Use mu_hat recent_N=6 to base forecast on the confirmed lowered-demand regime (6-period recent regime noted). Use sigma_hat recent_N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These settings reduce target base-stock relative to historical Jan mean and avoid overstock given large pipeline while keeping service balanced against $4 profit / $1 holding.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has declined materially (Period10 insight: recent 6-period avg ~86 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=274 (large pipeline). Observed lead times have been 1 or 2 periods; I let backend compute the average observed lead time to reconcile variability. For demand I use recent_N=6 to capture the new lower-demand regime (most recent 6 periods show the decline). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices keep orders aligned with the sustained lower demand while backend caps orders using its safety-cap calculation; large in-transit inventory reduces need for aggressive ordering.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=274 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5); recent behavior best represented by the last 4 observed lead times. Demand has shifted down from the Jan sample mean (~130.8) to a lower recent regime; I use the most recent 6 demand periods to capture the new lower mean/volatility. Using recent_N for L lets the OR engine anticipate faster arrivals on average (reducing required pipeline buffer). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6) targets the current lower-demand regime so orders avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service given the pipeline.

Demand dropped ~34% around Period 10 and the decline persists; use recent 6 periods to estimate demand mean/volatility (regime length=6).

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=262. Historical concluded lead times show mix of 1 and 2 periods (avg ~1.6). Demand has a confirmed downward regime (Period 10: recent 6-period avg ~86, -34%). Pipeline covers some demand but with variability in arrivals; use averaged observed lead time to balance optimistic/pessimistic arrival assumptions. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead-time mix. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts and volatility to the confirmed lower-demand regime (uses most recent 6 samples), reducing overstock risk while maintaining service given current pipeline.

Demand has clearly shifted down recently (carry-over noted); use recent_N=6 for demand mean/vol to capture the lower recent regime. These choices let OR backend compute base_stock and cap using recent demand while the calculated L reflects observed lead-time variability; this balances service (avoid stockouts given 268 in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime (carry-over: avg ~86 over most recent 6 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=310 \u2014 pipeline covers multiple weeks but arrivals are delayed (some orders concluded late historically). I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded lead-time evidence is mixed and previous confirmed 2-period signal is already recorded; do not yet escalate. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect the confirmed downward regime (uses last 6 periods to set (1+L)\xd7mean). Sigma similarly uses recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward the lower recent demand, avoiding excess holding cost while pipeline provides short-term cover against stockouts.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods with majority 2; recent observed lead times (last 6) average ~1.5 so use recent_N to capture current variation. Recent demand has fallen from earlier mean (~130.8) to a lower recent regime; use recent 6 periods to reflect current demand (~98 avg) and recent volatility. These choices let the OR engine size base-stock for the (1+L) review+lead window using recent demand and variance while accounting for observed lead-time variability and large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (recent avg ~1.6), no sustained shift; demand has shifted down (noted earlier) so use recent demand samples. Set L by averaging recent observed lead times to reflect current ~1.6 behavior.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime (carry-over: avg ~86 over most recent 6 periods). Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods. On-hand 22 + in-transit 273 = 295 units \u2014 this roughly covers one (1+L)=3 period forecast under the lower-demand regime but not by a large margin, so use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the new lower mean and reduced variability. Set L to default (use promised lead time = 2, consistent with confirmed observation). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the verified decline (3-period coverage scaled by recent mean). Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward the lower recent demand while keeping the lead-time assumption aligned with observed confirmations, balancing service vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Use promised lead time to align with contract (L=default=2). Forecast demand using the recent 6-period regime to capture the confirmed decline: mu_hat -> recent_N (N=6). Volatility has also fallen with the regime shift, so use sigma_hat -> recent_N (N=6). These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the lower recent demand while relying on large in-transit inventory to avoid stockouts; using recent stats reduces overstating mean/variance and limits excess holding costs.

Historical arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2 periods) with no clear permanent shift; demand has declined materially vs. Jan samples \u2014 recent periods show much lower sales. I choose L by averaging the most recent observed lead-time samples to capture the current mixed behavior (recent_N N=6). For demand I use a recent_N window (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower recent demand regime and recent variability. These choices bias orders toward current lower demand while still hedging against lead-time variability and in-transit stock.

Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132); use calculated average lead time so backend infers current mean L. Set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 6 periods to capture the downward regime (reduces overstocking) while pipeline provides coverage.

Lead-time evidence historically centers on 2 periods (confirmed P4) though some 1-period arrivals occurred; given promised lead_time=2 and no new sustained shift, use default L to let OR assume promised lead time. To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) so (1+L)\xd7mean recent demand is used. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce ordering relative to long-run averages while accounting for current pipeline to avoid overstock given high in-transit inventory and nonzero holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=273 (multiple outstanding arrivals overdue vs promised LT=2 \u2192 possible lost/delayed shipments). Historical concluded data show a sustained demand decline (recent 6-period avg \u224886 vs prior \u2248131). To be conservative about lead time uncertainty I'll keep L at the promised/default (backend knows LT=2) and use recent demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat: recent_N=6 captures the confirmed lower-demand regime and reduces target base-stock and cap, limiting excess holding given $1 holding vs $4 profit.

Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (recent sample avg \u22481.56) so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent observed demand has shifted downwards vs. Jan baseline (recent 6-period demands: 34,30,20,27,58,74 \u2014 sustained lower regime). Pipeline shows 273 units in-transit and on-hand 0; several past orders arrived with mixed L=1\u20132, and some shipments remain unconfirmed in conclude messages. I set L using 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period behavior). For demand I use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the recently lower regime (1+L multiplier applied by backend). This reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding given a high in-transit pipeline while preserving service via the backend cap. Approach balances profit vs. holding cost given high pipeline and confirmed demand decline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Recent demand has been lower than earlier (recent 6-period mean ~45.7 vs historical ~130). On-hand=0, in-transit=273 (large pipeline but arrivals not yet concluded). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent lower regime. Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching base stock to the new lower demand regime while the large in-transit volume reduces immediate ordering risk.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time behavior previously (Period 5 confirmed L=2) and a sustained demand decline identified around Period 10 (recent 6-period avg fell ~34%). I keep L at promised/default to let backend assume 2 while in-transit covers upcoming demand. For demand I use recent_N=6 to reflect the lower recent regime (matches detected 6-period decline) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean and volatility, reducing overstock while preserving service. This balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost by lowering target base stock toward recent demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=273. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 in earlier periods; no new sustained lead-time signal. Demand has been lower recently versus Jan samples with volatility: last 6 observed demands = [27,58,74,65,36,95] (mean ~59). To adapt to the recent lower-demand regime while capturing current variability, use promised lead time (default) and recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, balancing service and holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 10; use recent data to capture current lower mean/volatility. Chosen L='calculate' to use observed average lead time; mu_hat='recent_N' N=20 and sigma_hat='recent_N' N=20 to base (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 demand observations (captures sustained post-shift behavior). These settings balance service (use recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period4) and a sustained demand decline detected earlier (Period10: recent 6-period avg ~86 vs prior ~131). I keep L as promised (default = 2) because lead time was previously confirmed and no new contrary conclude messages since. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the persistent lower-demand regime (use last 6 periods to reflect the ~86 avg and reduced volatility). This biases orders down to limit holding cost while using pipeline (273) to cover upcoming demand under L=2.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-10-21: recent demand regime is lower (previously recorded Period10: avg \u224886 over recent 6 periods, ~-34% vs Jan). On-hand=0, in-transit=346 which provides coverage vs promised lead time (2) for the next (1+L)=3 periods. No new sustained lead-time or demand changepoint since prior notes. I choose L=default (promised 2) because lead time was previously confirmed and no new conclude messages contradict it. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to anchor mu_hat to the confirmed lower regime (uses the most recent 6-period average as noted). For volatility I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent variance. These parameters bias orders toward the lower recent demand level, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the new regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=403. Historical concluded messages show lead time has alternated but was confirmed as 2 earlier; no new sustained lead-time evidence, so keep promised lead time. Demand showed a drop around Period 10 but recent weeks (Periods 32-37) show higher demand (99,160,131,124,118,131) indicating a return to ~127 units/week. To capture the recent regime, I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L) scaling handled by backend). This prioritizes service for the current higher-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity (403) will temper orders via pipeline subtraction in the OR engine.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand 0, in-transit 354 (large pipeline). Recent demand has picked up since Sept: last 6 weekly demands = [160,131,124,118,131,123], mean \u2248131.2. Lead-time history is mixed but previously confirmed as 2; use promised lead time to keep OR engine aligned with contract. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime (Sept\u2013Oct uplift) and reflect current volatility; large in-transit stock plus (1+L) coverage reduces risk of stockouts while the recent_N forecast tempers over-ordering from older low-demand periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=416. Promised lead time=2; historical concludes (Period4) and earlier confirm lead time=2. Recent demand regime shifted upward around Period 34 (sustained higher weekly demand since P34). To capture the current higher/volatile demand I use recent_N=6 (periods 34\u201339) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend sets base-stock for the current regime. Using default lead time keeps promised L=2; recent_N estimates for mu/sigma focus safety stock around the observed modern demand and the high service level implied by profit/holding (q=0.8). No new lost-shipment signal identified.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=416 (large pipeline arriving in future). Historical concluded lead times show mix of 1\u20132 periods with no sustained shift since prior confirmation; keep promised lead time. Recent weekly demand has rebounded versus the earlier low-regime noted in Period 10; to capture current demand regime use a recent-window estimate. Selected L=default to respect promised lead time and avoid overcorrecting for intermittent 1-period arrivals. Selected mu_hat=recent_N (N=6) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 6 demand samples, capturing the latest demand level while smoothing noise. Selected sigma_hat=recent_N (N=6) to estimate volatility from the same recent window so safety stock reflects current variability. These choices balance service (use recent demand) against holding given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand regime is lower (carry-over: recent 6-period avg = 86). On-hand=0, in-transit=354 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods; use observed average to let backend infer current effective L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 6 demand samples to reflect the downward regime (keeps orders aligned with reduced demand and avoids excess holding given large pipeline). This balances service (using recent demand) vs holding cost by not inflating forecasts from older higher-demand periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=354. Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime (Period 10 insight) so I keep promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting but use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the lower average. L set to promised (default) to match supplier contract; mu_hat recent_N (N=6) to capture the confirmed decline in average demand over the most recent regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to base variability on the same recent window. This reduces overstock risk given holding cost while preserving service by sizing orders to recent lower demand patterns; existing in-transit stock (354) will also be considered by the OR backend when computing order quantity.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9. Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime (carry-over: Period10 decline). On-hand=0, in-transit=456 \u2014 large pipeline that will cover multiple review+lead periods so avoid aggressive additional ordering. Use promised lead time (default) since lead time was previously confirmed and no new sustained shift. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect the confirmed lower-demand regime and reduce forecasted base stock; same recent window for sigma to capture current volatility. These settings lower target base-stock and cap orders, balancing service with holding cost given heavy in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=456. Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime (Period 10 insight: recent 6-period avg ~86). Promised lead time is 2 and past concluded messages confirm lead time ~2 historically; keep default to let backend use promised L. For demand I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=6 to capture the confirmed reduced demand regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 6 samples). For sigma_hat I set recent_N N=6 so variability reflects the same recent window. This keeps orders aligned to the lower recent demand while backend caps orders using its cap formula and balancing profit vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=354. Historical concluded arrivals continue to show lead time \u22482 (recent P45: P43 order arrived with LT=2). Demand has been volatile with recent large holiday spikes (P42=232, P45=228) mixed with normal weeks; to capture recent mixed holiday-high demand I use a short recent window. L uses promised (default). mu_hat uses recent_N=6 to reflect the last 6 observed demands (includes recent holiday spikes). sigma_hat uses default to let backend compute volatility across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service during holiday spikes while keeping holding cost in check given substantial in-transit stock (354).

Historical concluded messages confirm lead time = 2 in prior periods and a sustained demand decline (Period 10 insight) with recent average ~86 over the last 6 periods. To reflect the confirmed promised lead time I use default L. To adapt to the lower recent demand regime I use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 6 demand samples\u2014this reduces target base-stock and caps orders, lowering holding costs while maintaining service for the current lower-demand regime and accounting for the large in-transit pipeline.
