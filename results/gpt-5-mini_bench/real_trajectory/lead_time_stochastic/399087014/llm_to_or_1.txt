Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean=50.2 units/week (n=5). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised. Promised lead time=2. Given no changepoints and small sample, use default lead time to let backend apply promised L=2 and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and volatility; this balances service level (avoid stockouts early) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent weekly demand samples: [82,35,31,48,55], mean=50.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=84 (order placed Period 1) but no arrivals have been observed yet (Period 1 conclude: arrived=0) so actual lead time is unconfirmed\u2014shipment may be still en route. Use promised lead time (2) to match OR backend assumptions and avoid over-adjusting for a single missing arrival. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level driven by profit/holding tradeoff using established historical demand instead of unstable short-run signals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan) show mean ~50.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=167 but no concluded arrivals for orders placed in P1/P2 (both arrived=0), so actual lead time is uncertain (could be \u22652 or shipments delayed/lost). Because no concluded arrival messages confirm a lead-time change and signals are not yet sustained, use promised lead time and demand defaults so the OR engine retains its built-in estimates: L=default (promised=2), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service level against holding cost while we wait for conclusive arrival evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=240 (orders of 84,83,73 from Periods 1-3) but no concluded arrivals in any conclude messages. Orders placed in Period 1 would have been expected to conclude by Period 3 if promised lead time L=2; they did not. This indicates actual lead time is longer than promised. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the observed delay so the OR engine orders to cover a longer pipeline. Demand history (samples: 82,35,31,48,55) is stable with mean ~50.2; I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (which scale the full-sample mean/std by 1+L and sqrt(1+L)) so forecasts incorporate the longer review+lead horizon while remaining conservative given limited data and no clear demand regime change. This increases target base-stock to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals while keeping volatility estimate unchanged.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (orders placed in Periods 1-3: 84,83,73 \u2014 none concluded by Period 3; P1 order expected by P3 conclude but arrived=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $332.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): on-hand=0, in-transit=249. History shows Period2 order (83) arrived in Period4 (ordered P2 -> arrived P4 => observed lead time 2). Period1 order never concluded (possible loss) but most reliable observed lead time = 2. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Demand history (sample mean \u224850.2) will be scaled by (1+L). Given no clear recent demand regime shift, use default demand/volatility methods so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (use observed L=2) against holding cost while noting some earlier shipments may be lost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=259. Concluded history shows a confirmed observed lead time of 2 (P2 order arrived in P4 with W=2) and several earlier delayed/no-arrival events but no sustained new lead-time regime beyond the confirmed 2. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-5) = [61,130,104,86,85] -> recent mean=93.2. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to capture confirmed signal, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the recent higher-demand regime vs older historical samples; this increases replenishment to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while sigma uses recent variance to size safety stock. These choices acknowledge overdue/lost shipments by relying on observed lead time rather than the promise and by using recent demand to avoid understocking.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=307. Concluded lead-time observations: order P2\u2192arrived P4 (LT=2), order P5\u2192arrived P6 (LT=1) \u2014 inconsistent with promised 2 and earlier lost arrivals. Many units remain in-transit, so I do not assume all prior orders are lost; I let the backend compute an average observed lead time. Demand in Periods 1\u20136 shows a clear upward regime versus the older 2019-Jan samples (recent demands: 61,130,104,86,85,79). I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent_N=6 most recent demand samples to capture the new higher-demand regime. This balances service (uses recent demand) while letting the OR engine infer lead time from actual concluded arrivals and account for missing/delayed shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand spike (Period7 demand=179; prior weeks: 86,85,79,104,130) and current on-hand=0 with large in-transit=307. Observed concluded lead times: order from P2 arrived in P4 (LT=2), order from P5 arrived in P6 (LT=1) \u2192 variable LT. I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent variability). Given volatile but historically moderate weekly demand, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service (higher L increases needed pipeline) against holding cost while leveraging full sample history. Large in-transit (307) should cushion immediate spike but variable LT justifies backend using averaged L.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=249. Observed concluded lead times: P4 (order P2) = 2, P6 (order P5) = 1, P8 (order P6) = 2 \u2192 use average observed lead time. Recent demand has increased vs. historical pre-2019 samples: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 4-8) = [86,85,79,179,148], mean=115.4, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime; use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so base_stock covers the elevated demand over review+lead. These choices (calculate L; recent_N for mu and sigma) steer the OR backend to a larger base stock to protect service level while sigma recent_N captures current volatility to avoid excessive over-ordering. Pipeline (249) will be counted by backend when computing final order.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=413. Recent concluded lead times: P2->P4=2, P5->P6=1, P6->P8=2 \u2014 average of last 3 observed = 1.67, so I use recent_N(3) to bias L toward recent behavior (captures intermittent 1\u20132 period arrivals and avoids relying on outdated 3-period observation). Demand has risen and become volatile (recent period demands: P5=85, P6=79, P7=179, P8=148, P9=88; mean=115.8), so I set mu_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the new higher regime while not overfitting a single spike. sigma_hat also uses the last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase safety stock relative to long-run averages to cover the observed demand spikes and variable lead times while the large in-transit quantity reduces the immediate ordering urgency.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Current on-hand=90, in-transit=250. Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1\u20132 periods); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 7\u201310) is markedly higher than the historical Jan samples, so set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new regime; likewise use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service level given higher demand while keeping variability estimates updated so holding cost is balanced against lost-sales risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg increased from 50.2 (historical Jan samples mean) to 122.25 (Periods 7\u201310 mean) \u2192 +143% (sustained high demand over 4 periods).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded lead-time observations show alternating 1\u20132 periods (observed lead_times: P4=2, P6=1, P8=2, P10=1) suggesting actual lead_time \u22481.5; use recent average of last 4 observed lead times.

Use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. On-hand=0, in-transit=320 \u2014 pipeline is large so parameters chosen rely on recent demand to size base stock and let OR cap prevent excessive ordering given holding cost (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies moderate service level).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent history shows a sustained higher demand regime since Period 7 (multiple weeks of 88\u2013179 units) and variable observed lead times (1\u20132 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=415 (pipeline large). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to let the backend average recent observed LT variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the sustained higher regime (Periods 7\u201312 average demand \u2248129.5) so the base-stock reflects current elevated demand. Sigma uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) while the large in-transit reduces need for overly aggressive orders; using recent stats prevents reverting to low historical January mean.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 observed); using calculated average of observed lead times to let backend infer typical L.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent demand has been elevated since Period 7 (Periods 7\u201314 demand: 179,148,88,74,160,128,117,150) \u2014 sustained high demand vs. historical Jan mean. On-hand=0, in-transit=344 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times (most recent 6): [2,1,2,1,2,2] -> average \u22481.67; I use recent_N=6 to capture this. For demand I use recent_N=8 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201314) so mu_hat reflects the current higher mean. Sigma_hat uses recent_N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock up to protect against stockouts in the sustained high-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity reduces the immediate order quantity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=448 (covers multiple future periods). Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 with occasional 1; recent observed lead times (most recent 5 concluded arrivals) average \u22481.8 \u2192 use recent_N for L with N=5 to reflect current realized lead-time mix. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime since Period 7 (sustained high weekly demand through Periods 7\u201316); to capture the elevated mean and recent variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (uses the last 10 demand samples to smooth short-term noise while focusing on the new regime). These choices increase target base stock to preserve service during the higher-demand regime and account for slightly variable lead times, while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility so the OR backend appropriately sizes safety stock and respects the cap.

Observed concluded lead times show mix of 1s and 2s recently; using recent_N over last 5 observed lead times (values: 1,2,2,2,1) to capture current effective lead time -> L recent_N N=5 (avg~1.6). Demand elevated and sustained since Period 7 (carry-over evidence): use recent demand regime (Periods 7\u201317, 11 samples) to set demand forecast and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher mean and variability. These choices give the OR engine an (1+L)-adjusted mean and std focused on the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting L reflect recent mixed deliveries, balancing service level (avoid stockouts under high demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Recent demand has been elevated vs. Jan historical samples but large pipeline already covers coverage. I set L using the observed-average to let OR account for realized variability.

Historical Jan mean=50.2; sustained demand regime shift detected from Period 7\u201310 (mean=122.25) and elevated demand persisted through recent periods. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1} \u2192 average \u22481.56. To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime I use recent demand samples for mu/sigma and let backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes. This balances higher service level (by sizing mu_hat to recent high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock and uncertain but ~1.6-period actual lead time.

Historical concluded lead-times are mixed (observed Ls = 2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,2,1,1...), so use backend 'calculate' to let it average observed lead times. Demand shows a sustained upward regime beginning around Period 7 (Periods 7\u201310 mean=122.25 vs historical Jan mean ~50), and subsequent periods continue at elevated levels; to capture recent elevated mean/volatility I use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine focuses on the latest 10 demand samples (covering the sustained high-demand regime and later variability). These parameters aim to raise the base-stock to cover higher demand while letting the backend cap order size to control exposure given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4).

LLM Rationale:

Recent observed lead times have been mixed (1\u20132) and no new sustained shift beyond previously recorded evidence, so use the promised lead time. Demand has pulled back from the high spike (Periods 7\u201314) and the last 5 observed demands (Periods 18\u201322 = 95,67,34,61,64) show a lower recent mean; to avoid overstock given the large in-transit, set mu_hat using recent_N=5. Keep sigma_hat at default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L) ) so the OR backend still captures overall demand variability while the recent mean tempers ordering.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-07-22. Recent concludes show mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals but majority=2; use calculated average lead time from observed concludes to capture this. Recent demand (Periods 19\u201323 = 67,34,61,64,41) shows no sustained high-demand regime; use recent_N=5 to capture current lower summer demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat so orders match near-term demand and limit holding cost. This balances service level (reflecting observed lead-time variability) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=349. Historical lead times vary (observed 1\u20132\u20133 earlier); to let backend infer systematic bias I choose L='calculate' (average of observed lead times). Demand showed a sustained higher regime beginning Period 7 (noted in carry-over), so I use recent_N for demand estimates to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime. I select N=19 (Periods 7\u201325 available recent regime length) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent regime, balancing service level (capture elevated demand) against holding costs given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=356. Historical demand shows an earlier sustained spike (Periods 7\u201310) captured previously; recent 10-period demand (Periods 17\u201326 = 90,95,67,34,61,64,41,28,32,42) reverts to a lower, more stable regime (mean \u2248 55). No new sustained lead-time evidence since Period 23 (orders still show mixed 1\u20132 periods). To avoid overstocking versus holding cost while covering the next (1+L) periods, I use the promised lead time and a recent-window forecast capturing the current lower regime. Thus: L=default so backend uses promised lead time; mu_hat uses recent_N with N=10 to reflect the current demand level; sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=10 to capture recent volatility.

Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=356 (large pipeline). Historical lead times have varied (observed 1\u20132 periods and some delayed/no-arrival events) so I retain the promised lead time as the baseline to avoid overfitting to intermittent delays. Demand shows earlier high-volatility spikes but recent weeks (Periods 24\u201327) are moderate; given the large in-transit position I keep default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical sample statistics. These settings aim to avoid placing aggressive additional orders while the pipeline clears, balancing service level and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-08-26. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=356 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods; no sustained shift since prior insights. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures mixed 1/2 signals). Demand has returned near pre-spike levels (recent 8 weeks mean \u224853 units); use recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 to focus forecast on latest regime and scale by (1+L). Use recent_N N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders aligned to current lower-demand regime while letting the backend cap orders given the large in-transit stock, reducing overstock risk.

Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=356. Historical lead times have varied (observed 1\u20133) so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 21\u201329) shows a lower, stable regime vs. the earlier spike; I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (Periods 21\u201329) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and scales volatility to recent std. This keeps orders aligned with the current lower-demand regime while the large in-transit volume (356) will be counted by the OR engine when computing pipeline coverage. No new lost-shipment signal requiring explicit L adjustment.

Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=356 (large pipeline). Historical observed lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods with more 2s than 1s; use calculated average lead time to let backend infer current typical LT from concluded arrivals. Demand history includes an earlier sustained shift (Periods 7\u201310) but recent weeks (Periods 27\u201330) show moderate demand; with a large in-transit position I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the OR engine uses the full-sample demand stats scaled by (1+L), avoiding overreacting to short recent fluctuation while letting L capture actual lead-time trend. This balances service (using pipeline) versus holding cost given high pipeline exposure.

I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures recent 1\u20132 period behavior). With uncertain but not firmly shifted demand regime since last recorded regime change, use default forecasting for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full historical samples. This balances service level (using observed shorter-than-promised lead times) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Historical concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (1\u20132 periods predominantly) so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent realized demand (Periods 30\u201333 = 74,83,50,88) is more representative than older Jan samples or the short high-demand spike in Periods 7\u201310, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (captures current late-summer/early-fall demand).

Promised L=2; no recent concluded arrivals to robustly change that, so use default promised lead time to avoid overfitting to missing-conclude noise. Recent demand (Periods 28-34: 69,48,74,83,50,88,44) suggests a moderate demand regime; I use recent_N with N=8 (last 8 demand periods) to capture the most recent demand level while smoothing older volatility. Use the same recent_N window for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (by sizing to recent demand) against holding cost given uncertain in-transit reliability.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=356. Historical demand shows high variability and a sustained higher-demand regime was recorded earlier (Periods 7\u201310). Many recent periods show demand samples in history but shipments/arrivals have been irregular; no new sustained changepoint detected. To avoid introducing unsupported lead-time or demand regime shifts (given mixed arrival evidence and large in-transit stock), use the promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies its full-sample statistics. This balances service (use full historical mean/variance) while avoiding overreacting to noisy/partial arrival signals.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=356. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1\u20132 periods (observed sample avg ~1.67) so I let backend compute the empirical average (calculate) to adapt to recent variability. Demand history shows no new sustained regime change since prior insights; use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) so the OR engine leverages all data for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat. This balances service (using observed lead-time average) vs holding cost given a large in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=356. Historical concluded lead times: [2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,2] \u2192 avg=1.6; recent concluded arrivals show mix of 1\u20132 periods (no new sustained shift). Demand earlier showed a sustained regime shift around Periods 7\u201310 (recorded previously). Given mixed lead-time evidence, set L by calculating the average observed lead time so the OR engine adapts to the empirical mean (1.6). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (this leverages full historical demand while accounting for the inferred lead time). This balances service (higher implied review+lead demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (observed average \u22481.6) so I use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead times. Demand had a prior sustained regime shift (Periods 7\u201310) but recent weeks show normal weekly variation; no new sustained changepoint detected. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding ratio) with holding cost given a large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=356. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1s and 2s with average ~1.6 and many subsequent periods with no arrivals (possible lost/delayed shipments). Demand history shows no new sustained regime shift since prior insight. To let the OR engine infer a realistic effective lead time from observed arrivals, I choose L=calculate (average of observed lead times). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend uses the full-sample demand mean/variance scaled by (1+L), avoiding overreacting to short-term gaps while the in-transit pipeline is large.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=356. Recent conclude history shows no new sustained change in lead time or demand since prior carry-over insights; many periods with zero concluded arrivals so cannot reliably recalculate actual lead time from recent data. In-transit inventory (356) is large relative to historical weekly demand (~50\u201390) so pipeline likely covers (1+L) periods. I choose promised/default settings to let the OR backend use full historical samples for forecast: L=default (use promised 2), mu_hat=default to compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples), sigma_hat=default to compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This is conservative given no new sustained changepoint evidence and large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=356. Recent concluded history shows multiple observed lead times (1\u20132 periods) with no sustained shift beyond that\u2014use calculated average lead time from observed concludes. Demand history includes earlier regime shifts but no new sustained change in the most recent periods; use default demand forecast and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend uses full-sample statistics given available evidence. The chosen settings let the backend adjust base-stock while respecting observed lead-time variability and current pipeline inventory.

Recent concluded demand (Periods 39\u201343) = [50,51,38,133,43], recent average ~63 with notable variability. Promised lead time=2 and recent arrival pattern is mixed but not a new sustained LT change. To balance service vs holding cost I use recent data to set demand forecasts and volatility while leaving L at default (promised).

Demand history shows recent elevated variability but no new sustained regime beyond previously recorded shift, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let OR engine apply its base-stock formula while respecting observed lead-time average. This balances service (capture in-transit supply) against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=356. Promised lead time=2. Recent sales show a clear uptick starting Period 42 (P42\u2013P45 demands = 133,43,31,204; recent mean=102.75 over last 4 weeks) consistent with holiday-season volatility. I keep L as default (use promised lead time) because concluded lead-time history shows 1\u20132 periods and no new sustained lead-time change. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the current elevated mean and high variance; this biases orders upward to cover (1+L) review+lead demand while reflecting increased volatility and avoiding understock during the holiday spike. In-transit 356 provides cushion against immediate stockouts but parameterization accounts for elevated short-term demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=427. Historical observed lead times vary (1\u20132 periods) so use empirical average to let backend infer current effective LT. Recent demand shows elevated levels in late Dec; to capture this regime I use a recent_N demand estimate based on the most recent 4 concluded demand samples to scale (1+L) mean. Volatility also estimated from the same recent 4 samples. These choices bias orders upward to cover the observed December demand spike while letting the OR engine combine with lead-time and service-level math to balance profit ($4) vs holding ($1).
