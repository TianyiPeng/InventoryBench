Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (week after 2019-02-04 sample). Recent weekly demand samples (5 weeks): 39,38,59,55,73. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Use promised lead time (default) since no observed lead-time changepoint. Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend computes base-stock from full history; this balances service vs holding given symmetric profit vs holding cost ($1 vs $1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=77 (order placed P1 not yet arrived in P1 conclude). Historical weekly samples mean ~52.8 from provided data. No concluded arrivals beyond promised lead time to confirm a lead-time change or sustained demand shift, so use defaults: keep promised lead time, and let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples. This treats demand as stable and avoids over-adjusting for a single delayed shipment while balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand mean = 52.8 (samples: 39,38,59,55,73). On-hand=0, in-transit=155 (orders placed P1=77,P2=78). Promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence to change lead time. Pipeline (155) roughly matches (1+L)*mean = 3*52.8 = 158.4; to let OR backend use its default demand stats and the promised lead time, I select default methods for L, mu_hat and sigma_hat so the engine computes base_stock and cap from historical sample mean/std and promised L. This balances service level (pipeline nearly covers next 3 periods) against holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 52.8/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=168 (orders from P1-P3) but Period 3 conclude shows arrived=0 \u2014 orders that should have arrived by now under promised L=2 have not concluded, suggesting actual lead time may be longer or shipments delayed/lost. Conservatively extend lead time to 3 to cover the missing-arrival risk and avoid stockouts while in-transit is unresolved. I use L explicit=3; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level (higher base stock due to longer L) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Profit: $51.00, Daily Holding Cost: $27.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows a Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 with lead_time=2, matching the promised lead time. Current inventory: on-hand=27, in-transit=136. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) have mean ~52.8; with promised L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 weeks. No evidence of sustained demand regime change or lost shipments beyond the single confirmed arrival. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent history shows one confirmed observation of actual lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 136 (covers multiple periods of demand). Use lead-time inference via calculate to reflect observed lead times. Use default demand and volatility (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set (historical weekly samples provided). This balances service (observed LT=2) with holding cost by letting the OR engine set base-stock from full-sample demand statistics while respecting the measured lead time and current pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=165. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) show mean ~52.8/wk; recent concluded history shows shipments arriving with 2-period lead time (Period 2 order arrived Period 4). No sustained demand regime change detected. I keep L at the promised lead time to align with observed confirmations, use default mu_hat to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures multi-period coverage), and default sigma_hat so backend scales historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (covering L+1 weeks of demand) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has risen with a large spike (Period7 demand=94). On-hand=0, in-transit=165 (some prior orders did arrive; Period 4 confirmed lead time=2). I set L=default (use promised 2) because lead time was confirmed and no sustained deviation since. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime: last 5 demands (Periods 3\u20137 = 38,51,68,55,94) give mean\u224861.2; (1+L)=3 so mu_hat reflects 3\xd7recent mean to cover review+lead. Sigma left as default to let backend use full-sample variability (conservative uncertainty). This configuration balances higher recent demand (raises target base-stock) against existing in-transit (165) so the OR engine can top up only if pipeline is insufficient.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=155 (large pipeline). Recent sales volatile with a one-off spike (94 in P7) but last 5 demand observations give a more robust short-term forecast. Two concluded arrivals show lead time=2 consistently; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to focus the (1+L) demand forecast and variability on the most recent regime while avoiding overreaction to the single large spike. This keeps orders aligned with current pipeline to avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=192 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 in prior evidence, and promised lead time is 2. Demand history is variable without a clear, sustained regime shift. To avoid overreacting to recent spikes and because pipeline already sizable, use default lead time and population-based demand estimates so backend computes base-stock from full-sample stats. This balances service (using full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P8\u2192P10). On-hand=32, in-transit=136 \u2192 ample pipeline but demand history (samples mean=52.8/week) implies (1+L)=3 review+lead horizon. Use default methods to keep estimates grounded in full-sample history and proven lead time: L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=default -> (1+L)*mean_all_samples \u2248 158.4, sigma_hat=default -> sqrt(1+L)*std_all_samples \u2248 22.7. With profit=holding, service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0) so base_stock\u2248mu_hat; using defaults avoids overreacting to intermittent lost orders while the conclude messages consistently show L=2.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=142. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2,2,2 and one 1 (avg=1.75). Several earlier orders did not arrive on schedule but multiple concluded arrivals confirm predominant LT\u22482. To let the backend reconcile mixed observations, use calculate for L (average observed lead time). Demand forecast & dispersion: no clear sustained demand regime shift from provided weekly samples, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) to balance service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=155 \u2014 large pipeline expected to cover upcoming demand. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4 from P2), 2 (P8 from P6), 2 (P10 from P8), and 1 (P10 from P9) \u2192 average ~1.75. Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times.

To be conservative and let the OR backend use observed history, set L method to calculate (avg observed lead time). Demand forecasting uses full-sample defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level and holding cost given current pipeline and modest profit/holding parity.

On-hand=0, in-transit=152 \u2014 pipeline is large (covers multiple periods) but arrivals are only visible next period. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR backend compute base-stock while respecting the promised lead time and avoiding manual over/under-corrections given occasional lead-time variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows multiple confirmed arrivals with observed lead times = {2,2,2,1,2} (avg ~1.8), on-hand=0, in-transit=152. Pipeline is large so orders may already cover upcoming demand; use inferred average lead time to let backend size review+lead period correctly. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent weekly demands have been volatile but generally around 30\u201350 units; on-hand=0, in-transit=149. Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 periods (confirmed P2->P4, P6->P8, P12->P14, P15->P17). No sustained lead-time or demand regime change since prior insight. Use default lead time (promised 2) so OR backend aligns with contract. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service vs holding given equal profit and holding cost ($1/$1). This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit inventory and confirmed L=2.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=149. Historical concluded arrivals overwhelmingly show a 2-period lead time (multiple Pairs: P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P8\u2192P10, P12\u2192P14, P15\u2192P17) with a single 1-period outlier; no sustained lead-time shift. Demand history (samples provided) yields a modest weekly mean (~52.8). Promised lead time is 2; I keep L=default to align with contract and recent confirmed arrivals. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this produces a base_stock that balances the equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5) while leveraging the full historical demand estimate. With 149 units in-transit and zero on-hand, this avoids over-ordering given the long review+lead period and confirmed lead-time reliability.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Recent demand has fallen from ~40s to mid-teens/20s in the last 3 periods (P17-19: 18,23,18). On-hand=0, in-transit=149 which already provides cushion vs (1+L) periods of demand. Observed concluded lead times are mostly 2 (one 1); I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To react to the recent lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (captures the new lower mean and recent volatility) so the OR engine will reduce target base-stock and avoid excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. Recent concluded history shows mostly 2-period arrivals (several P->P+2 confirmations) with one P+1 exception; on-hand=0, in-transit=149. Promised lead time is 2 and historical arrivals support that. Use default lead time to match promised (and backend expectations). Demand samples (provided 5 weekly samples mean=52.8) are limited but seasonal context (summer) shows no confirmed sustained regime shift. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring the OR engine sets a base-stock that balances the equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5) without overreacting to short-term noise. This also avoids overstating demand while substantial pipeline (149) exists.

Promised lead time=2 and prior concluded messages consistently show 2-period arrivals. Use default lead time to align with contract and let OR backend compute base-stock from historical statistics. Using default mu_hat/sigma_hat leverages full-sample mean and variance ((1+L) scaling) while the large in-transit quantity reduces immediate need to inflate forecasts\u2014this avoids excess holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Demand samples provided (early 2019) are limited; no recent sustained demand regime shift is evident. I therefore use the default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the full sample set. This keeps the backend's base-stock calculation aligned with confirmed lead time and avoids overfitting to sparse recent noise while the sizable in-transit pipeline is present.

Promised lead time is 2 and prior carry-over confirmed LT=2 at Period 5; no new sustained LT evidence. To reflect the recent low-demand regime, I use recent_N=7 for demand mean and volatility (covers Periods 18\u201324). Using default lead time keeps promised L=2 while the backend still uses promised LT. This balances service (avoid excess ordering given large in-transit and low recent demand) vs holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent observed weekly demand has fallen from spring peaks (40\u201370) to low summer levels (last 6 periods: 18,12,18,12,10,4). On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 5 insight). Given confirmed lead time and large in-transit stock, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This avoids overreacting to short low-demand run while letting backend cap orders using its cap formula against current pipeline.

Use default lead time (promised) and default demand stats so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this trusts the confirmed LT and stable demand history while avoiding overreaction to recent low-volume noise.

Use default L (promised) since confirmed by concluded arrivals and no evidence of lost shipments requiring an explicit longer lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit and holding ($1/$1).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=149. Historical demand samples (seed) show weekly mean ~52.8. Prior conclude messages confirm lead time = 2 periods. I use L=default (promised lead time) to keep OR engine aligned with supplier terms and because concluded history matches promised. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures base demand estimate of ~52.8/week scaled for review+lead). This balances service vs holding given profit=holding so target service quantile will be 0.5; using defaults avoids overfitting to recent noisy zero-arrival periods while in-transit stock (149) is available to cover upcoming demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=149. Historical concluded lead-time evidence (Period 5) confirmed L=2. In-transit stock (149) likely covers upcoming demand for multiple periods; avoid over-ordering to limit holding cost (profit=holding so conservative stocking). Set L explicitly to confirmed 2. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand while keeping parameters simple given no strong recent regime change. This balances service-level (using confirmed L) against holding cost given large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=149. Historic concluded arrivals consistently show lead time=2 (carry-over). Recent periods (P23\u2013P30) show a sustained uplift in demand (period demands: 12,10,4,22,48,70,55,84) vs earlier low-demand regime \u2014 evidence of a regime shift starting around Period 27. To adapt the forecast to the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N=8 (captures P23\u2013P30 trend) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets higher base-stock while keeping L as promised (default). This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent surge) vs holding cost by letting the backend compute safety stock from recent mean/variance.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=149. Recent demand shows a clear uptick starting Period 26: [22,48,70,55,84,126] (Periods 26\u201331), indicating a new higher-demand regime. Lead time has been observed as 2 periods (confirmed earlier), so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the last 6 periods (N=6). This raises the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast and volatility to better cover higher demand while the capped order will limit extreme over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=203. Historical demand shows a clear regime shift starting Period 27: recent demand (Periods 27-32) average = 83.0 vs prior Periods 1-26 average = 35.5 (+134%). Lead time was previously confirmed as 2 periods. To react to the sustained higher demand I set L=default (use promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (covering the six-period new regime) so the OR backend computes a base stock centered on the elevated mean and volatility, improving service during the new high-demand regime while letting the capped order limit constrain excessive orders given pipeline=203.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: avg increased from 35.5 (Periods 1-26) to 83.0 (Periods 27-32), +134%

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Recent demand has a clear, sustained upward regime starting Period 27 (avg ~83 over P27\u2013P32) with very large spikes in P31\u2013P33 (126,115,227). On-hand=0, in-transit=249 (pipeline present but arrivals observed with confirmed 2-period lead time historically). I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded-history repeatedly shows 2-period arrivals and the backend expects promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 27\u201333 regime) so mu_hat reflects the new higher mean over the sustained regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=7 to capture the increased volatility in the new regime. These choices raise the base stock to meet the much higher current demand while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock to cover observed spikes; using recent samples avoids diluting the forecast with older low-demand periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime increase beginning Period 27 (higher weekly demand since then) and multiple on-time arrivals consistent with 2-period lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=311 (pipeline large). I set L=default to trust promised lead time (confirmed historically). For demand I focus on the new high-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (Periods 27-34) to size the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility from the recent regime. This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher demand while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Demand has shifted up since Period 27 (carry-over insight recorded previously). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=269 (large pipeline from recent orders). Observed lead-time samples = {2,2,2,1,2,2,3} (orders with concluded arrivals), average = 2.0. One recent 3-period observation exists but overall average remains 2. To let the OR engine use observed lead times while remaining robust to a single longer arrival, I set L to 'calculate' (avg observed). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) which captures the confirmed demand regime shift and high recent demand. This balances service (higher mean due to regime change) versus holding cost given a large pipeline position.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

I set L using recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent realized lead-time mean (3,3,1 -> ~2.33) so the backend can adapt. For demand I use recent_N with N=10, matching the length of the new high-demand regime (Periods 27-36) so mu_hat reflects the post-changepoint mean; sigma_hat also recent_N N=10 to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices align supply with the confirmed higher demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent lead-time variability.

Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift since Period 27 (much higher weekly demand) and mixed observed lead times (2 and 3 periods recently). On-hand=0, in-transit=336 (large pipeline). To capture the recent lead-time variability I use recent_N for L (short window). For demand and volatility I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to reflect the higher mean and variability (N equals the regime length). These choices steer the OR backend to target a higher base-stock appropriate for the new higher-demand regime while respecting observed lead-time variation and the large existing pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=211. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 27 (avg rose from ~35.5 to ~83 over Periods 27\u201332) and recent weeks (P31\u2013P38) show high weekly demand (84\u2013227, then 114\u2013167). Lead time evidence is mixed (observed 2 early, some 3-period arrivals around P32\u201333, and a 1-period arrival P37\u2192P38); not a clear sustained lead-time change. I therefore keep L as default (promised=2). For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=12 (covering the recent high-demand regime) and match sigma_hat to recent_N N=12 to capture current volatility. These settings drive the OR backend to raise the base stock to meet the new higher-demand regime while capping orders per its cap rule to limit excess inventory given unit holding cost equals profit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand is in the higher regime (changepoint at Period 27: avg rose from 35.5 to 83.0). On-hand=0, in-transit=350 (large pipeline). Lead times observed vary (1\u20133); average of observed concluded lead times \u22481.9 \u2014 use calculated average. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, set demand estimates using recent samples from the post-shift regime (most recent 13 periods). Sigma uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand while accounting for variable lead time and avoiding understocking the current high-demand regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 27 (higher mean since then). On-hand=0, in-transit=350. Observed lead times have varied (1\u20133) so use an averaged lead time estimate. Set L by averaging observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent high-demand regime (use the last 14 periods since the changepoint at Period 27) so the OR engine sizes base stock and caps using the current high-demand mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the new high regime) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 27 (higher mean) and mixed observed lead times (mostly 2, some 1\u20133). Current inventory: on-hand=45, in-transit=211 (sizable pipeline). I set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed concluded lead times (captures recent 1\u20133 period variability rather than blindly trusting promised=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=15) to base mu_hat on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 27\u201341) so the base stock reflects the higher demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=15) to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices balance service (by sizing to the new higher demand and observed LT) while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand data; the large in-transit quantity reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Demand has a sustained upward regime starting Period 27 (carry-over: avg rose from 35.5 to 83.0). Lead times have varied historically; use observed average rather than promised. I set L by calculating the average of all observed concluded lead times to capture actual variability. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (N=16, Periods 27-42) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher demand and recent volatility, helping the OR backend size base stock for the new regime while the calculated L accounts for lead-time variability and overdue/in-transit units (301) already in pipeline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime from Period 27 onward (avg ~83 over P27-32 and continued elevated weekly demand through P43). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (large pipeline that will cover several weeks once it concludes). Observed lead-times have varied; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N over the most recent 16 periods to capture the new high-demand regime while limiting dilution from earlier low-demand history. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=16 to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the elevated demand regime while the large in-transit volume reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 27 (higher mean) and variable observed lead times (1\u20133), but concluded lead-time evidence includes Period 5 confirming 2 periods and later sporadic 3-/1-period observations; no new sustained lead-time change. On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (large pipeline) which likely covers upcoming demand for the promised lead time. I select L=default (use promised lead time=2) to let the backend assume promised LT while we keep monitoring concluded arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages the full historical data including the confirmed higher-demand regime while the large in-transit quantity reduces urgency to upweight recent spikes. This balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given high pipeline volume.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand permanently shifted higher at Period 27 (carry-over). On-hand=72, in-transit=211 (sizable pipeline). Lead times have fluctuated but no new sustained shift beyond previously recorded; keep promised lead time. Use demand estimates anchored to the post-change regime: compute mu_hat from recent post-changepoint samples to reflect the higher average demand (reduces stockouts) and compute sigma_hat from the same recent window to capture current variability. This balances service (avoid lost sales in high regime) while cap limits and holding cost plus existing pipeline constrain over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=41, in-transit=258. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); recent concluded arrivals show mixed L but averaged recently ~2\u20133. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 27 (higher mean); use the post-shift history for demand estimates. Set L via recent_N to capture the most recent lead-time behavior. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N using the full post-shift regime (Periods 27\u201346, N=20) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the elevated demand mean and volatility, which balances service vs. holding given profit=holding cost.
