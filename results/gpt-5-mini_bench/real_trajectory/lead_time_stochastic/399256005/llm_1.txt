Ladies denim (ankle jeans) is seasonally relevant for early-spring wardrobe updates; modest uplift plausible around this time. b) Demand regime analysis: historical weekly demand shows a clear upward trend across five samples (2019-01-07:41; 01-14:38; 01-21:65; 01-28:85; 02-04:137).

No in-transit or concluded arrivals in history to contradict promise. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0.

Given upward trend and high per-unit profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), I increase coverage to meet expected continued growth: order 411 units (\u22483 * last observed peak 137) to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost modest relative to profit.",

Lead time evidence (from concluded history) confirms variable actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=730 units \u2014 a very large pipeline. Even under a high-demand assumption (e.g. 200/week) 730 units would cover multiple weeks; under the observed low-demand regime it covers many more. Ordering now would risk substantial holding cost ($1/unit/period) while existing pipeline likely satisfies demand. Therefore place no new order this period.",
