Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (92,68,85,95,64) give mean ~80.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet, and no sustained demand regime change detected. Use promised lead time default (2) and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost under no new evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Product is a seasonal casual tank top; no calendar events imminent. On-hand=0, in-transit=104 (order placed in Period 1). The order showed arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude which is consistent with the promised lead time of 2 (we should only expect arrival visibility in Period 3 conclude). No sustained demand or lead-time changepoint detected (historical samples from Jan\u2013Feb show stable weekly demand). To let the OR engine use its historical estimates and promised lead time, I select default lead time and default demand moments so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost, deferring adjustments until we observe concluded arrivals or a sustained demand shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=216 (orders from P1+P2). Promised lead time=2 but no concluded arrivals yet (Period1 and Period2 conclude show arrived=0), so insufficient evidence to change lead-time estimate or demand regime. Historical weekly demand mean ~80.8. To avoid overreacting to possible delays/lost shipments, use default lead time and default demand/stdev calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively while awaiting confirmed arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=288 from prior orders but no concluded arrivals yet (Periods 1-3 show arrived=0) \u2014 possible delays or lost shipments but no concluded arrival evidence to confirm a different lead time. Use promised lead time (default) because lead-time change is unconfirmed. Demand history (5 weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb) shows no confirmed changepoint; use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost conservatively given uncertainty about shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $112.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent realized weekly demand in concludes: P1-4 = 105,163,162,207 (high and volatile vs historical sample). On-hand=0, in-transit=201 (some earlier orders failed to conclude; only one concluded arrival shows lead_time=2 for Period2->Period4, suggesting promised LT=2 is still plausible). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (captures the confirmed 2-period observation). For demand forecast I use mu_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) \u2014 this uses long-run sample mean scaled by review+lead to be conservative given volatile recent spikes. For uncertainty I use sigma_hat='default' so backend uses population std scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices bias ordering toward covering (L+1) periods of baseline demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from observed volatility; this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Historical weekly demand mean=80.8 (samples: 92,68,85,95,64). One concluded arrival shows an order placed Period 2 arrived in Period 4 (lead_time observed = 2), matching promised lead time. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=347 which covers ~4.3 weeks and exceeds the default (1+L)\xd7mean = 3\xd780.8 = 242.4; therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation while accounting for sufficient pipeline inventory. No sustained demand regime change detected.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (order on Period 2 arrived Period 4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=201. Historical concluded lead times: Period4 arrival (order P2->P4) = 2, Period6 arrival (order P5->P6) = 1 \u2014 mixed signals, so use calculate (average observed) for L to reflect recent variability. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes demand over (1+L) periods from full sample history. This balances service (captures longer observed lead time) against holding cost given limited on-hand and substantial in-transit inventory. No clear sustained regime change detected, so keep carry-over empty.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=365. Demand has clearly increased vs. historical Jan samples (recent weekly demands: 163,162,207,105,190,210) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime; shipments have mixed lead-time evidence (one observed L=2, one L=1). To be conservative about lead time estimation use backend-calculated average of observed lead times. Set demand forecast using the most recent periods (capture the higher regime) with N=5. Use recent volatility from same window to reflect higher variability and drive safety stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand has risen sharply vs Jan samples (recent demands: 207,105,190,210,220) indicating a new higher regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=361 (comprised of orders P1:104, P3:72, P4:25, P8:160); no arrivals visible this period. Observed concluded lead times: P4 showed 2 (order P2\u2192P4), P6 showed 1 (P5\u2192P6), P8 showed 1 (P7\u2192P8) \u2014 recent median/mean leans toward ~1\u20131.33. I set L using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent lead-time behavior (weights last three observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (periods 4\u20138), so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands. Sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility. These settings raise the forecasted order-up-to to match the higher recent demand while using recent lead-time observations to avoid overcommitting inventory given some shipments arrived faster than promised.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has been high and variable (last demands: 105,190,210,220,188). On-hand=0, in-transit=560 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P5\u2192P6), 1 (P7\u2192P8) \u2014 mixed but skewing to 1 recently. I set L using recent_N=3 to capture the most recent lead-time behavior. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime (balances service vs holding given large in-transit). Sigma uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR engine compute base_stock and cap based on the recent higher mean and volatility while respecting current pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=151, in-transit=201 covers several weeks, no new lost-shipment signal. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the observed average lead time (captures mixture of 1\u20132 period arrivals). For demand and volatility I select 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, yielding conservative replenishment that balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Demand is high and volatile (historical weekly samples: 92,68,85,95,64 and recent observed large weekly demands). On-hand=0, in-transit=282 (several outstanding orders). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); I choose to let the backend use the empirical average lead time (calculate) so the policy accounts for mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), letting the OR engine set the base-stock while the averaged L mitigates missing/delayed shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=469. Historical concluded lead times observed = {2,1,1,2,1} (avg=1.4) so I use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand shows a clear upward regime starting Period 4 (recent periods average ~207 vs historical samples mean ~80.8). To capture the new higher demand, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (focus on most recent regime data while keeping sample size >=3). These choices raise the base stock to cover the higher recent demand while sigma recent_N captures current volatility; using calculate for L lets OR reconcile actual observed lead time pattern with promised lead time. Pipeline (469) will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing final order. 

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg increased from 80.8 to 206.9 (+156%)

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=14, in-transit=609 \u2014 large pipeline but recent demand has shifted up since Period 4 (historical mean 80.8 -> recent ~206.9). Recent arrivals confirm multiple lead_time observations (mixed 1\u20132 periods). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures observed 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained regime shift starting Period 4 (regime length 10 periods: P4\u2013P13). I also use sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These settings focus orders on the higher recent demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent demand remains in the higher regime identified at Period 13 (post-Period 4 shift to avg \u2248207). On-hand=140, in-transit=422 => pipeline=562 units providing strong cover for upcoming periods. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2); use calculated average to capture true service delays. Set L by 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (N=11 samples since Period 4) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean across the review+lead horizon; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=11 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while letting OR backend compute safety stock given profit/holding parity.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): recent history shows a higher demand regime (noted earlier) and variable actual lead times (observed lead times = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2], avg \u22481.57). On-hand=0, in-transit=422 which provides substantial coverage vs. expected demand. I select L=calculate to let backend use the empirical average observed lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively, balancing service-level (to cover the confirmed higher-demand regime) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and lead-time variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019/6/3 Period 17. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 4 (carry-over: avg rose ~+156%). On-hand=0, in-transit=448 (large pipeline covering multiple periods). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132), with prior confirmation of 2-period lead for an earlier order; I use the average observed lead time to let the backend calibrate L. For demand I use recent_N to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use the last 13 periods since the shift at Period 4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and caps reflect the new higher mean and volatility, balancing service (higher mu_hat \u2192 higher base stock) against holding cost (backend will use profit=holding to set z).

Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods; using 'calculate' lets backend average observed lead times. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift upward (noted earlier); I use recent_N for demand and volatility to focus the forecast on the high-demand regime (last 14 periods since the changepoint at Period 4). This increases mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods of higher demand while sigma_hat (recent_N) captures current volatility. These choices prioritize service (profit = holding penalty) given strong recent demand and substantial in-transit inventory to avoid over-ordering.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been in the ~200/week regime since Period 4 (carry-over noted +156% shift). On-hand=0, in-transit=545 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2), so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean/variance: recent_N with N=15 (Periods 4\u201318) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current high-demand regime and avoid dilution by the earlier low-demand samples. This keeps base-stock aligned to the elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces aggressive ordering risk.

On-hand=0, in-transit=519\u2014large pipeline likely covers many future periods. Observed concluded lead times vary (1s and 2s); use calculated average lead time to reflect observed data. For demand forecast use recent regime samples (Period 4 onward) to capture the sustained step-up (N=16). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These settings bias the OR backend toward stocking for the higher, sustained demand while allowing its capped order logic and promised lead time to limit excess orders.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (weekly demands ~200+), so forecast should focus on the post-change samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=549 (pipeline well-stocked vs current stockout). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132), average ~1.44; we'll let the backend compute the empirical average. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent post-changepoint samples (Period 4 onward) to capture the sustained higher mean/volatility (N=17 periods from P4\u2013P20). This prioritizes service (profit=holding cost) by sizing base-stock to current high-demand regime while relying on measured lead-time average to avoid over-ordering for intermittent 1-period arrivals.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=582. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (observed: 2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,1 \u2192 avg\u22481.44) and a sustained demand regime shift upward (noted earlier). To capture true lead-time behavior use calculate (avg observed). For demand I use recent_N to focus on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use last 18 periods since the regime from Period 4 onward is ~18 periods long). Matching recent_N for sigma_hat preserves volatility estimate from the same window. These choices help the OR backend set a base-stock aligned to recent higher mean demand while the calculated L reflects realized lead-time evidence; with 582 units in-transit this avoids over-ordering while maintaining service given high recent demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=552. Historical concludes show mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals but promised lead time is 2. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (previously recorded) and recent weeks remain elevated (last 5 demands: 157,230,366,174,121 \u2192 higher than original baseline). Use promised lead time to keep backend assumptions aligned with contract, and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while letting the OR engine cap orders per its rule to limit overstock given holding cost = profit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=596 (large pipeline). Concluded history shows mixed lead times (observed values: 1 and 2 periods) so set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to let backend infer actual average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history (captures baseline demand from provided samples); with large pipeline this avoids over-ordering while letting OR engine balance service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=596 (large pipeline; some arrivals missing in recent concl. but many concluded lead times = 1\u20132). Use L=calculate to let backend average observed concluded lead times (history shows mix of 1 and 2; avg \u22481.55). Demand shows a sustained upward regime confirmed earlier (higher mean since Period 4); use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand and capture recent mean/volatility. This biases orders toward the newer, higher-demand regime while the large pipeline limits order size and helps manage holding cost vs. service level given profit=holding.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=519. Historical concluded lead times (12 observed arrivals) average \u22481.67 periods with values {1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3}; no sustained (>3 periods) shift to a longer lead time despite one 3-period event, so do not permanently change policy to L=3. Given observed lead-time variability, set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to let the OR engine incorporate actual behavior. Use default demand/volatility aggregation (backend will scale (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) so forecasts remain anchored to long-run samples while L reflects realized lead time. This keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) periods of demand while leveraging historical demand mean/variance and the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering if shipments arrive on average faster than promised.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 (large pipeline). Recent concluded demand (last 5 periods: P23\u2013P27) = [132,254,99,79,53], mean=123.4 \u2014 recent demand elevated vs early-sample mean but volatile. Observed lead-times have varied; no new sustained lead-time change since prior insights. Use promised/default lead time to let backend assume L=2. For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-but-volatile regime; this (1+L)*mean will reflect current pace while the large in-transit stock reduces risk of stockout. Use default sigma (all-sample std scaled) so backend retains full historical volatility for safety.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 \u2014 sizable pipeline but no inventory available this decision moment; recent sales have been volatile with a prior sustained demand regime increase (noted earlier). Observed lead times have varied (1\u20133); use calculated average to let backend infer typical LT from concluded arrivals. Demand has softened recently (Periods 24-28: 254,99,77,53,59) so I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower regime and recent volatility. These parameters aim to replenish enough for (1+L) periods of demand while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent variability). Demand shows a sustained regime shift to higher mean (noted in history), so use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus estimates on post-shift demand dynamics and recent volatility while accounting for (1+L) review+lead horizon. These parameters balance service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given the substantial in-transit stock.

Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 \u2014 large pipeline present from prior orders but recent concluded periods show irregular arrivals (lead times observed 1\u20133 historically). Demand history includes a past sustained regime shift to higher demand (not reversed), and recent zero ending inventory reflects stockouts rather than lower demand. Given pipeline size and uncertain/variable lead-time observations, use promised lead time (default) and full-sample demand statistics so the OR engine computes base stock from the long-run mean/volatility. This avoids overfitting short stockout-driven low sales in recent periods and leverages existing in-transit volume.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=519. Historical concluded lead times vary; recent observed lead times (last 5 arrivals) = [1,1,2,2,3] -> average ~1.8. Demand has fallen sharply since late July: recent 7-period demands (Periods 25-31) avg ~74.6 vs prior high-regime avg 206.9. To reflect the confirmed shorter-than-3 but ~2-period lead behavior while smoothing noise, I set L using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent lead-time mix. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the new low-demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead period. Sigma is set recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend forecasts lower target base-stock for the new lower-demand regime while accounting for the observed lead-time distribution and recent variability, avoiding excess holdings given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: avg decreased from 206.9 to 74.6 (-64%), sustained across Periods 25-31 (7 periods).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=519. Historical concluded messages show a sustained lower-demand regime beginning at Period 24 (carry-over: avg ~74.6 across Periods 25-31). No new sustained lead-time change observed (previous confirmation of L=2). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (no new evidence to override). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to reflect the current low-demand regime (Periods 25-32, regime length=8) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 8 samples; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 8 samples (recent volatility). These settings align the base-stock toward the lower recent demand, while the large in-transit position (519) will be counted by the backend pipeline calculation to avoid over-ordering and reduce holding cost exposure.

Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 24 (sustained through Periods 25\u201331); use recent_N with N=7 to set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on that low-demand regime so orders align with reduced demand and avoid excess holding given Profit=Holding.

On-hand=0 but large in-transit=519 units (covers many weeks at current demand). Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed concluded lead times (history shows variability 1\u20133 periods). For demand mean/volatility use recent_N with N=12 to reflect the post-Period-24 low-demand regime (12 periods in-regime through Period 35). This keeps forecast and safety stock tuned to the lower recent demand while relying on the in-transit buffer to avoid immediate stockouts.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=519. Historical concluded lead-time evidence supports promised 2-period lead time (confirmed in prior concludes). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 24 (sustained ~70s). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (2). For demand across review+lead (1+L=3 periods) I use a recent_N forecast to capture the post-Period-24 low regime (use last 13 recent samples from the low regime). Volatility is estimated from the same recent window (recent_N N=13). These choices keep the OR backend focused on the sustained lower-demand regime while using pipeline information to avoid over-ordering given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 24 (sustained ~70s), so forecast should reflect the reduced mean/volatility. On-hand=0 but large in-transit=519 units (covers many weeks), so avoid inflating targets. Use default promised lead time (2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 24\u201337, length=14) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on recent low-demand behavior; this reduces excess holding given the large pipeline while preserving service for expected demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 24 (avg ~74.6); last 15 concluded periods (P24\u2013P38) show stable, lower demand (35\u201399, mostly ~50\u201380). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=519 units; promised lead time=2. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time while recent concluded history supports reduced demand. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (the sustained low-demand regime length) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility using the most relevant recent data; this prevents over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 24 (sustained low ~70s through Periods 32-39); current on-hand=0 but large in-transit=519 which should cover upcoming demand given promised lead time. Use promised lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned (no new confirmed LT shift). For demand forecast, use recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (most relevant samples from the last 8 periods) so mu_hat reflects the lower mean; likewise use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk while the large in-transit volume preserves service.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 (large pipeline). Historical concluded data show a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 24 (~74.6 avg). Promised lead time=2 and prior confirmation exists; use promised lead time (default) to keep OR engine aligned. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the recent low-demand regime (use last 7 concluded demand samples to reflect the sustained drop). This reduces target base stock and caps order quantities to avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent demand regime is the lower regime confirmed at Period 32 (avg \u224874.6 across Periods 24\u201331). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 519 (large pipeline compared with recent weekly demand). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133) with overall average \u22481.67; promised = 2. To be conservative about arrival uncertainty I use the calculated average lead time (captures observed variability). For demand I use a recent_N estimate anchored on the sustained low-demand regime since Period 24 (use the last 18 periods of the low regime) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean over that recent window; volatility also set to recent_N over same N to reflect current lower-variance behavior. These choices reduce overstating demand vs. holding cost given the large in-transit stock and the sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 \u2014 large pipeline likely from earlier high-order regime. Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed lead times is used to capture realized delivery behavior and avoid under-ordering given past 1\u20133 period variability. Use mu_hat and sigma_hat default so backend computes demand across review+lead using all historical samples (conservative given past regime shifts and limited new sustained evidence). This balances service (prevent stockouts with large in-transit) against holding cost by letting OR engine set base stock with realized lead-time average.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=519. Historical concluded messages confirm a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 24 (carry-over records: avg fell to ~74.6). No new sustained lead-time change since lead time was previously confirmed as 2. To reflect the recent low-demand regime, I use a recent-window forecast for demand (mu_hat) and matching recent volatility (sigma_hat). I keep L at the promised/default to let the OR engine use the contractual 2-period lead time while relying on recent demand stats to size orders; this reduces over-ordering risk given large in-transit stock and high holding cost equal to profit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 24 with sustained lower weekly demand (Periods 25-44 mostly 35\u2013125, recent avg ~60). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 (sufficient pipeline for several weeks). No new confirmed lead-time shift; use promised lead time. Set L=default to let backend use promised 2. Use recent demand (last 12 concluded periods, P33\u2013P44) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower regime and current season (pre-holiday steady/low demand). This keeps base-stock aligned to recent demand while avoiding overstock given high holding cost equal to profit.

Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed lead times (~1.67) so use 'calculate' to let backend set L based on observations. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 24 (sustained); use recent_N=20 to focus mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 20 weeks to capture current lower mean/volatility while still smoothing noise. This balances service (use recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 (many prior shipments have not concluded recently; treat those as unreliable). Historical demand shows the sustained low-demand regime identified earlier (Period 24 onward) \u2014 use recent regime data rather than full-sample mean. Keep lead time at the promised default (2) because concluded messages confirm 2 historically and no new sustained LT evidence. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (regime length =7 periods of sustained lower demand) so (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std reflect the current lower-demand volatility and avoid overstocking against potentially lost in-transit units. This balances service level with equal profit/holding cost by tightening forecasts to recent demand.
