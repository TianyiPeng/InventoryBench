Winter season still relevant but demand appears subdued. b) Demand regime analysis: Historical weekly demand samples: 2019-01-07:229 (clear outlier), 2019-01-14:49, 2019-01-21:68, 2019-01-28:62, 2019-02-04:42. Excluding the 229 outlier, recent 4-week average = (49+68+62+42)/4 = 55.25 units/week. Trend: slight downward toward ~40s. c) Lead time & missing orders: Promised LT=2 periods; no concluded arrivals observed yet so actual LT unconfirmed. Treat LT as 2 for planning and assume risk of longer LT; no in-transit to reconcile. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Need to cover current period demand (occurs after ordering) plus next 2 periods (L+1=3 periods). e) Order logic: Use recent average ~55 units/week \xd7 3 periods = 165 units to cover (L+1) periods with minimal safety stock given downward trend and holding cost $1/unit/period vs. profit $4. This balances service level and holding cost while awaiting lead-time confirmation.",
