The system currently reports In-transit=318 (likely P1 180 + P13 138) but these pipeline units are uncertain \u2014 past evidence shows orders can be lost or delayed.

Current in-transit=318 likely includes P1 (180, overdue) and P13 (138, overdue/uncertain).

Demand outlook: recent weeks show a spike (Periods 28-30 demands = 27, 40, 172) but averaging the most recent four non-zero periods (P27\u2013P30 = 36,27,40,172) gives ~69 units/week.

Lead-time inference: no concluded arrivals in recent periods to confirm that the in-transit 318 will arrive on time, so treat in-transit as unreliable.

Conservatively assume near-term demand \u2248180 units/period (based on two most recent high weeks) \u2192 3-period demand \u2248540 units.

  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history shows actual lead time = 3 periods (e.g., orders P32\u2192arrived P35, P36\u2192arrived P39), so I use L=3 not the promised 2. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0, In-transit=318. Recent realized demand (Periods 43\u201346: 29,49,37,35) \u2248 avg 37/week; (L+1)=4 period coverage target \u2192 expected demand \u2248 37\xd74 = 148 units. Pipeline (318) comfortably exceeds this coverage and provides buffer vs. demand variability. OR recommended 2 units using promised L and historical stats; that recommendation ignores confirmed longer lead time and the large existing pipeline. Ordering now would arrive after 3 periods (too late to affect immediate sales) and increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) unnecessarily. Final strategy: place no order this period to avoid excess holding costs while existing in-transit inventory covers the next (L+1) periods of demand. Monitor arrivals in upcoming conclude messages; if arrivals fail to materialize or demand shifts up for \u22653 sustained periods, resume ordering and record carry-over insight.",
