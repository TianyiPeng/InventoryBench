Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-02-11. SKU 156231001 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and limited recent history (5 weekly samples from Jan 2019). No concluded arrivals to infer a lead-time change. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std to compute base stock; this balances service vs holding given equal profit and holding costs and avoids overreacting to sparse data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=228 (order placed P1). P1 conclude shows arrived=0 which is expected given promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals observed yet, so no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipment. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks Jan\u2013Feb) average ~180.2. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost without overreacting to a single unconfirmed non-arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=457; two recent orders (Periods 1\u20132) have not concluded (arrived=0) so possible delays but insufficient sustained evidence to change lead-time estimate. Use default lead time (promised=2). Demand history (5 samples from Jan\u2013Feb) shows mean ~180 units/week; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L) scaling and full-sample volatility. This keeps the OR engine anchored to historical demand while letting it handle pipeline sizing; if shipments continue missing, future periods should switch to an explicit or calculated L.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=608 (orders from P1-3). No concluded arrivals => cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3) is much higher than historical Jan samples: recent avg = 275 (203,313,309) vs historical avg = 180.2 (five Jan samples). I treat this as a sustained upward regime (3 consecutive high-demand periods) so set demand forecast using the last 3 periods to capture the new level and volatility. Methods chosen: L=default to rely on promised lead time (no confirmed lead-time change); mu_hat=recent_N N=3 to reflect elevated demand over the lead+review window; sigma_hat=recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to improve service given the higher observed demand while keeping holding risk explicit to the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (observed in Periods 1-3): avg increased from 180.2 (Jan samples) to 275 (203,313,309) (+52.7%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $229.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand (Periods1-4 = 203,313,309,235) shows a sustained upward regime vs Jan baseline; observed arrival (Period4 conclude) confirms an actual lead time of 2 for the one concluded order. On-hand=0, in-transit=596. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead-times (matches promised=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime using the four most recent periods. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the backend on the higher recent mean/variance while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding understock given large in-transit but uncertain overdue shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=795. Confirmed actual lead time=2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime starting Period1 (Period1-3 demands: 203,313,309). To target current higher demand, set L by calculation from observed lead times and set mu/sigma using recent_N=3 (captures the recent high-demand regime). This focuses the base-stock on the elevated regime while the OR engine will combine with promised L and pipeline; using recent samples helps avoid understock given overdue past arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent demands: P4=235, P5=170, P6=237; historical early surge noted previously. On-hand=0, in-transit=596 units (sufficient to cover multiple periods). Observed lead times from concluded messages: order placed P2 arrived P4 (L=2); order placed P5 arrived P6 (L=1) \u2192 average recent lead time ~1.5. No clear evidence of lost shipments (recent orders have arrived, some late). I select L by averaging observed lead times to reflect the shorter recent delivery (method: calculate). For demand I use a recent_N forecast (N=3: P4\u2013P6) to capture the most recent regime (mean demand \u2248214) and avoid bias from the earlier surge; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep the OR base-stock responsive to the current demand level while using pipeline to avoid overordering given decent in-transit stock.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=642 (large pipeline). Observed lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 use calculate to average observed LT. Demand recently elevated and variable (recent demands: 235,170,237,243 plus earlier 309) \u2014 use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on latest regime. recent_N N=5 balances recent high-demand periods while limiting noise from older samples. These choices reduce risk of understock given heavy pipeline uncertainty and elevated recent demand while letting backend cap orders via its cap.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=671. Recent concluded lead times: orders ordered P2\u2192arrived P4 (LT=2), P5\u2192P6 (LT=1), P7\u2192P8 (LT=1) => recent average ~1.33. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 1 (previous carry-over). Recent demand trajectory (Periods 4-8): 235,170,237,243,351 shows elevated mean and volatility. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect observed shorter recent lead times and to avoid overstocking against the promised 2-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to let the backend forecast using the most recent 5 demand observations (captures the higher post-change demand and current volatility) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has been well above Jan baseline (periods 1-9: 203,313,309,235,170,237,243,351,286) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=742 (large pipeline). Observed lead times from concluded messages: P4 (order P2\u2192arrived P4)=2, P6 (P5\u2192P6)=1, P8 (P7\u2192P8)=1. I use recent observed lead times (last 3) to set L to capture the mixed 1\u20132 period behavior. For demand I use a recent_N=9 estimate (all recent periods since the regime shift) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher current mean and volatility. These choices prioritize service (raise base-stock to meet elevated demand) while recognizing substantial in-transit stock; using recent windows helps the OR backend avoid underordering given the changed demand and variable lead times.

Use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. For demand, recent window captures the higher regime vs Jan samples: use recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility, balancing service level against $1 holding cost by relying on recent mean and std rather than stale January averages.

Period 12 (2019-04-29).

To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding=$1), I use an empiric average lead time and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 demand periods to capture the new, higher regime while keeping variance from recent data.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent observed weekly demand has been well above the original historical Jan samples (recent demands: 203,313,309,235,170,237,243,351,286,214,181,209) indicating a sustained higher regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=799 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods). I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times from concluded messages. For demand I select recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across all available periods (uses (1+L)*mean of last 12 samples). For volatility I select recent_N N=12 so the backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std of the same recent window. These choices prioritize matching base stock to the confirmed higher demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits immediate ordering aggressiveness, and using observed lead-time average helps account for 1\u20132 period variability in arrivals.

Observed lead times from concluded messages = {2,1,1,2,1,2} (avg 1.5) so use calculated average rather than trusting a fixed promised value. Recent demand has been elevated and relatively stable in the most recent 5 periods (Periods 9-13 demands = 286,214,181,209,185; mean \u2248215), so use a recent_N forecast to capture the current regime. sigma also set to recent_N to reflect recent volatility. These settings (L=calculate, mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent 5) let the OR backend size base stock to meet the elevated recent demand while acknowledging existing large in-transit stock and balancing service vs holding costs.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Observed arrivals show mixed lead times (1 and 2 periods); no clear sustained change so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand periods (many >200) are above the older Jan samples \u2014 use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the higher regime and match pipeline (on-hand=0, in-transit=645). Chosen params: L by calculate to reflect observed 1\u20132 variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N (N=6) to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime, which increases service level while avoiding excessive holding given $1 profit vs $1 holding.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent weekly demands have been high (history shows many 180\u2013351 samples; recent periods 170\u2013309). On-hand=0, in-transit=645 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 or 2 periods); average observed lead time ~1.5. To let the OR engine reconcile promised vs observed variability while using all historical demand data, I set L=calculate (backend will average observed lead times) and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This leverages full sample history and the inferred average lead time to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect mixed 1\u20132 delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples; this leverages all available demand history while the calculated L adjusts the replenishment horizon to cover the longer effective pipeline. This balances service (accounting for slower arrivals) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Concluded history shows mixed actual lead times (1 and 2 periods across recent arrivals) so I use a recent average to capture variability. Demand has softened relative to the early high spike; I use the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 13-17 = 185,205,227,157,99) to form mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock reflects current lower demand and reduces excess holding given holding cost equals profit. These choices balance service (accounting for variable lead time) and lower holding cost by forecasting on the latest regime. No new sustained pattern beyond prior carry-over insight.

Observed lead times fluctuate between 1 and 2 (recent event average \u22481.4) so use recent_N to capture that mix; use recent_N for mu_hat to focus forecast on the last 5 demand observations (Periods 14-18 mean \u2248163) which reflect the post-regime-demand level; keep sigma_hat default so backend scales volatility with chosen L.

Recent demand has softened versus earlier spike; use recent 5 weeks to capture current lower regime and reduce overstock risk. Chosen methods: L=recent_N (N=5) to average last 5 observed lead-times; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demand samples; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

Several orders never concluded in some stretches, so use observed average lead time rather than promised to better match arrivals. I select L='calculate' to let backend use the average observed lead time. Demand history includes early high winter/spring samples and lower recent weekly demand; given no strong new sustained regime (already recorded earlier), use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level against holding cost while accounting for the empirically shorter average lead time and the large in-transit pipeline.

Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2,1,2,1} (avg \u22481.43) so I let backend calculate average lead time from observed data. Recent demand has fallen materially since spring; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 18-22) = [127,83,41,53,53], avg \u224871.4, so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the low recent regime. I also use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to reduce target base-stock (lower mu_hat) to avoid excess holding cost given low recent demand, while letting the backend compute lead time from observed arrivals to account for mixed 1\u20132 period behavior.

Demand has fallen from early high-Jan/Mar spikes to low recent weekly values (Periods 18\u201323: 127,83,41,53,53,30), indicating a sustained low-demand regime. To reflect uncertain actual lead time use calculate (avg observed). For demand forecast use recent samples to capture the current low regime: recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand based on the latest pattern while capping order by pipeline; this reduces over-ordering given large in-transit volume and balances service vs holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=645. Recent demand has fallen sharply in summer (last 5 periods much lower than spring). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods); use calculated average to reflect this variability. To capture the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (Periods 20\u201324) so the backend targets (1+L)-period demand under current summer demand and reduced volatility, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline starting Period 20: avg dropped from ~155 (Periods13-19) to 37.2 (Periods20-24) (~-76%), sustained for 5 periods

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has sharply declined starting Period 20 (Periods 20-25 avg low volumes), while pipeline is large (in-transit=645) from earlier orders. Observed lead times have varied (1 and 2 periods) so use calculated average lead time. For demand forecasting use recent regime (periods 20-25) to capture the sustained low-demand regime: set mu_hat recent_N with N=6; mirror this for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prevent the OR engine from topping up to high base-stock based on historical high-demand periods while accounting for current low demand and the large in-transit pipeline.

Observed concluded lead times alternate 1\u20132 periods; using calculate to let backend average observed lead times.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. On-hand=0, in-transit=645 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2 periods); I use calculate to average all observed lead times (reflects true recent mix). Demand dropped sharply starting Period 20 but recent 7 weeks (Periods 21-27 = 53,53,30,9,19,84,197) show renewed variability\u2014use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the current low/volatile regime. This keeps the base-stock responsive to recent demand while the averaged lead time moderates ordering given the large in-transit pipeline and possible delayed shipments.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=645. Historical concluded lead-times show a mix of 1\u20132 periods; recent observations average ~1.4. Demand had a low regime (Periods 20\u201325) but the last 3 periods (P26\u2013P28 = 84,197,149) show a clear uplift. To balance service vs holding given large pipeline, I set L based on recent observed lead times, and forecast demand using the most recent 3 periods to capture the resurgence while letting the OR backend scale to (1+L). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect increased short-term volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the renewed demand spike while capping excess ordering because substantial in-transit inventory already exists.

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence starting Period 26: avg increased from ~34 (Periods20-25) to 143 (Periods26-28) (+320%)

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=645 (many undelivered orders outstanding). Recent demand regime: Periods 26-29 demands = [84,197,149,114], avg\u2248136 \u2014 sustained resurgence vs prior low-demand regime. Several past orders have arrived with 1-2 period lead times, but the large in-transit with no recent conclutions suggests some shipments delayed/lost; to be conservative set lead time higher than promised. Chosen methods: L explicit=3 to allow for potential extended arrival delay; mu_hat recent_N N=4 to target the new higher-demand regime (uses (1+L)*mean of last 4 samples); sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to capture recent volatility. These parameters push the OR backend toward higher base stock to meet the confirmed demand resurgence while using recent volatility to limit excessive safety stock given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand recovered sharply from Period 26 onward (Periods 26-30: 84,197,149,114,243). On-hand=0, in-transit=645 (large pipeline that may cover multiple weeks but arrivals not yet concluded). Observed concluded lead times have alternated 1\u20132 periods; I let the OR engine compute the average observed lead time (calculate). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (Periods 26\u201330) to capture the demand resurgence: recent_N with N=5. This focuses the base-stock on the higher recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility. These choices balance service (higher demand forecast) against holding cost by using observed recent demand rather than long-ago low-demand periods.

Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 (multiple 1s and 2s); use calculate so backend averages observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat/sigma_hat to focus forecast on the current high-demand regime (Periods 26-31) so base-stock responds to the resurgence while accounting for recent volatility; this balances service level (avoid stockouts given large current demand) against holding cost given big in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand 0, in-transit 645 units. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1 and 2-period outcomes (observed sequence: 2,1,1,2,1,2,1) \u2192 average ~1.43; recent demand (Periods 26-32 = 84,197,149,114,243,274,255) shows a sustained resurgence since Period 26 with mean \u2248188. To reflect observed lead-time variability I set L to the calculated average of concluded lead times. To focus the demand forecast on the confirmed high-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures periods 26\u201332). This keeps the OR backend\u2019s base-stock responsive to the resurgence while the large in-transit position (645) will de-risk immediate stockouts without new aggressive ordering.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Promised lead time is 2; many past arrivals showed 1\u20132 period variability and some lost orders, so retain promised lead time to let backend use contract L=2.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has strongly resurged since Period 26 (many high weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=830 \u2014 large pipeline but past arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1 and 2). I choose L=calculate to use observed lead-time history (captures 1\u20132 period variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 26\u201334) to capture the sustained new high-demand regime (avoids dilution by earlier low summer demand). Sigma likewise uses recent_N N=9 to reflect current volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the confirmed high-demand regime while letting the OR backend compute service-level buffer given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand resurgence confirmed starting Period 26: avg increased from ~34 (Periods20-25) to 241.11 (Periods26-34) (+~609%), sustained for 9 periods

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=830. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed = {2,1,1,2,1,2,1} \u2192 avg ~1.43) and a sustained demand resurgence starting Period 26 (high weekly demand since). To reflect recent high demand regime while letting the OR backend compute lead-time from observed history, I request: L by calculating the average observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast and volatility on the recent high-demand regime (use N=9 to cover the resurgence window). This keeps safety stock responsive to the sustained higher demand and compensates for prior missing/late arrivals by relying on the calculated lead time and recent demand stats.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand 0, in-transit 859 \u2014 large pipeline but recent orders (P34,P37) not yet concluded. Observed concluded lead times historically vary (1\u20132 periods); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly resurged starting Period 26 and this higher regime persists through Period 37; use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 26\u201337) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean and volatility. These choices focus ordering on the recent high-demand regime while letting the backend account for empirical lead time variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 26 (confirmed in carry-over). Observed concluded lead times (from arrive messages) = [2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1] \u2192 average ~1.375. On-hand=0, in-transit=830 (large pipeline arriving in future periods). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures actual lead-time behavior vs promised 2). Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should reflect the recent high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201338); I use recent_N with N=13 (periods 26\u201338 inclusive) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover the current sustained demand level while the calculated L accounts for faster-than-promised arrivals. This balances service (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=834. Recent demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 26 (Periods 26\u201339 show large values, resurgence confirmed). Lead times observed vary (1 and 2 periods); use calculated average lead time to let backend infer typical realized lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand since the changepoint at Period 26 (N=14 periods, Periods 26\u201339) so the forecast reflects the sustained high-demand regime and recent volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts during the resurgence) with holding cost by using recent data rather than all-time averages.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26 (weeks 26\u201334 demand avg much higher). Lead-time observations vary between 1\u20132 periods; use calculated average to reflect observed variability. Set demand estimate using recent regime (Periods26\u201334) to capture the resurgence; match sigma to same recent window. These choices prioritize service (profit=holding so critical to meet demand) while limiting excess inventory by using recent demand statistics rather than long-ago low-demand periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 26 (large resurgence sustained through Periods 26-41). On-hand=0, in-transit=1045 (pipeline large). Historical concluded lead times are mixed (observed 1 and 2); average of concluded lead times ~1.44. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 26-41, regime length 16) so mu_hat reflects the current elevated mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility; N=16 chosen per changepoint detection rules. These choices prioritize meeting high current demand (raise base stock) while the large in-transit position (~1045) will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing orders, avoiding excess new orders given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26, with very large weekly demand in the last 9 concluded periods (Periods 34-42: 358,351,337,447,309,322,271,285,461). On-hand is 0 but in-transit is large (1045 units) so pipeline is already substantial. Promised lead time is 2; observed lead times have varied (1\u20132) but not consistently longer, so use default promised L to let backend assume 2. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the current high-demand regime (N=9 covers the most recent 9 concluded samples). Use the same recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility. These choices focus ordering on the elevated recent mean while recognizing a large in-transit pipeline to avoid excess additional orders.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent concluded arrivals show variable actual lead times (observed recent lead_times = 3,2,1,2,1 across last arrivals) so I use recent_N for L to capture current variability. Demand has clearly resurged and been sustained since Period 26 with high weekly sales in Periods 33-43; to reflect the current high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 9 demand samples to capture current mean and volatility while smoothing short noise. These settings help the OR backend size base stock for the (1+L) review+lead window under the confirmed high-demand regime and account for increased volatility and inconsistent arrivals.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=980 \u2014 large pipeline that will cover upcoming demand but recent demand regime (since Period 26) is high and sustained (many weeks of 200\u2013400+ demand, recent weeks: P42=461,P43=200,P44=367). Observed lead times vary (1\u20133); occasional 3-period arrival seen (order P40 arrived in P43). To balance service vs holding given Profit=Holding ($1/$1) (q=0.5 \u2192 z\u22480), I keep a conservative short-term lead-time estimate using recent observed lead times, and forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime to avoid stockouts while pipeline clears. Choices: L via recent_N to reflect recent variability in observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N using the recent high-demand regime (use N equal to recent regime length) so the OR backend computes a base stock sized for current elevated demand and measured volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand regime is high (Periods 37-45 avg \u2248 347.8 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=978 (large pipeline arriving in future concludes). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); recent 5 concluded arrivals average \u22482, so use recent_N for L with N=5 to reflect current supplier speed. Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=9 (last 9 weeks, regime from Period 37\u201345) so (1+L)\xd7mean captures the high recent demand over review+lead period. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward meeting the sustained high demand while the large in-transit pipeline will be reconciled by the backend pipeline_inventory term.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=1044 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are variable (samples: 2,1,1,2,1,2,1,1,2,3,2,2 \u2192 avg\u22481.67), so set L by calculate to reflect observed average rather than promised. Demand has a sustained high regime starting Period 26 (multiple periods of elevated demand through Period 46); use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime (use up to 20 most recent samples per rules). These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to the recent high-demand regime while accounting for the empirically observed lead time and recent volatility; large in-transit stock will cap ordering implicitly.
