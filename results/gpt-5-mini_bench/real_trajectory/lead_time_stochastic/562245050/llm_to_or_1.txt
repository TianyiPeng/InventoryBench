Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time is 2; no evidence of lead-time deviation or demand regime change in the 5 historical weekly samples (97,57,65,61,55). Use default L to respect contractual promise and allow OR backend to compute pipeline targets. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring base-stock covers review+lead demand while capped by the backend cap to limit excess inventory given equal profit and holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=96 (order placed P1). Promised lead time=2 and we have no concluded arrivals yet, so do not infer a lead-time change. Historical sample mean ~67/wk; use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps policy aligned with promised lead time while covering review+lead demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=189 (orders from P1+P2) and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical weekly demand samples (97,57,65,61,55) show mean ~67. Promised lead time is 2 but concluded messages show no arrivals so far\u2014insufficient evidence to change lead-time estimate. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding), use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates: set L=default so OR uses promised lead time=2; set mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)=3\xd767; set sigma_hat=default to capture observed variability across all samples. This keeps ordering conservative given in-transit stock and unconfirmed delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed demand has risen: Periods 1-3 demands = 45, 77, 134. On-hand=0, in-transit=196. Promised lead time=2. No concluded arrivals for prior orders (ordered but arrived=0), so cannot confirm an actual lead-time change yet; shipments may be delayed. I use L=default (promised 2) to keep OR engine aligned with contractual lead time while monitoring delays. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent upward demand regime (uses the last three demand samples 45,77,134 \u2192 (1+L)*mean over recent samples). This increases forecast and variability to reduce stockouts given in-transit (196) appears short of expected demand over review+lead (3 periods). These choices balance higher service (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given uncertainty and possible shipment delays.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: prior baseline (2019-01 samples mean=67) vs recent 3-period mean=85.33 (+27%); monitor for persistence. Multiple recent orders have not concluded (orders placed in P1-P3, arrived=0) \u2014 possible shipment delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $93.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demand has jumped vs. historical baseline: last 3 demands = {77,134,124} indicating a higher recent mean; some earlier orders remain unconcluded (P1 and P3) though P2 arrival confirms lead time=2 for that shipment. I set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead-time evidence (observed = 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent higher-demand regime (covers P2-P4). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise forecasted base-stock to improve service during the confirmed demand uptick while limiting overreaction by using only the recent 3-period regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand elevated: last 3 periods demands = {P3:134, P4:124, P5:134} (avg ~130.7), earlier baseline (~67 from Jan samples) is lower. On-hand=0, in-transit=325; several earlier orders showed delayed/no arrival but Period 4 conclude confirmed an order (P2) arrived with lead_time=2. I treat lead time as confirmed average (use calculate). To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses the three most recent high-demand samples) so the OR backend will target a higher base_stock while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated demand and existing in-transit) vs holding cost given profit=holding so service level calibrated by backend.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has shifted up starting Period 4: P4-P6 demands = 124,134,141 (mean 133) vs historical sample mean 67. Pipeline shows on-hand 21 and in-transit 230, but several early orders (P1-P3) never concluded, indicating intermittent shipment issues. For lead time I use recent_N=2 (observed lead times: 2 from P2->P4, 1 from P5->P6) to capture current variability without overreacting. For demand forecast I use recent_N=3 (P4-P6) to reflect the new higher regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices increase base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping L responsive to observed lead-time fluctuation and noting potential lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: prior baseline mean=67 (Jan samples) vs recent P4-P6 mean=133 (+99%); sustained over 3 periods. Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 never concluded (no arrivals recorded for those orders).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent demand has shifted upwards: Periods 4-7 demands = [124,134,141,210], indicating a sustained higher regime vs Jan baseline. Observed concluded lead times: P4 conclude shows order from P2 had lead_time=2; P6 conclude shows order from P5 had lead_time=1 \u2192 mixed evidence. Many earlier orders were delayed or not concluded, so use average of observed lead times. Set L to calculate (average observed). For demand, use recent_N over the detected new regime (Periods 4-7, length 4) to capture the higher mean; use the same recent_N=4 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base stock to meet higher demand while using recent variability and empirical lead-time to avoid underordering despite prior missing arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward (Period 6-8 demands = 141,210,223) versus earlier baseline (Jan mean \u224867). On-hand=0, in-transit=242 \u2014 pipeline is large but mixed-speed: observed lead times have been 1\u20132 periods (some earlier missing arrivals resolved). I set L=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed lead times (evidence: observed W = 2,1,2,1 in concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new high-demand regime (use last 3 periods: 141,210,223) to size base stock for (1+L) review+lead demand and to avoid understocking. Using recent_N for sigma_hat captures elevated volatility. This balances higher service need from the sustained demand increase against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has materially increased and persisted: Periods 7-9 demands = [210,223,188] (mean ~207), well above Jan baseline (~67). On-hand=0, in-transit=506 (large pipeline). Arrival history shows mixed lead times (observed = 2,1,2,1), suggesting average lead time ~1.5. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to anchor the forecast/volatility on the sustained higher-demand regime (captures P7-P9). This balances higher service level (to avoid lost sales given zero on-hand) against holding cost by using short recent window rather than all-sample mean. The large in-transit volume is noted but may include delayed shipments; using recent demand will help the OR engine size orders appropriately.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=136, in-transit=278. Recent demand has been elevated and sustained since Period 4: recent periods (P4-P10) show strong demand (period demands P4..P10 = 124,134,141,210,223,188,207; recent avg \u2248 169.0). Observed conclude messages show mixed lead times of 1 and 2 (observed W = [2,1,2,1,2,1], avg 1.5) so use calculated average lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent regime (use recent_N with N=7 for P4-P10). This balances higher service level (to avoid stockouts during sustained demand) against holding cost by basing base_stock on recent demand and using observed lead-time average so pipeline coverage matches reality.

Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (some early orders lost), so use observed average lead time rather than promised. I set L to be calculated from concluded history to reflect the 1\u20132 period mix. For demand I use recent_N (N=5, P7\u2013P11) to capture the new higher regime (avoids diluting with January baseline). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the OR engine to target a larger base stock appropriate for the sustained demand spike while using recent volatility to avoid extreme safety stock growth given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 4: prior baseline mean=\u224867 (Jan samples) vs Period4\u2013Period11 mean=\u2248187 (+179%); sustained for 8 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (sustained elevated demand through Periods 4\u201311). Multiple concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed lead times: 2,1,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=659 (large pipeline). To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine use observed lead-time behavior, I set L to the calculated average lead time and use recent_N (N=8) for demand mean/volatility to reflect the sustained regime from Periods 4\u201311 (8 periods). This balances service (higher mu_hat) versus holding cost given large in-transit stock and variable lead times.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 4 (higher demand sustained through Period 13). Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead times averaging ~1.57 periods (mix of 1 and 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=547 (large pipeline). To reflect confirmed higher demand, set L using calculated average of observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the detected high-demand regime (Period 4\u201313, length 10) so the OR backend targets service for the new demand level while capping orders via its cap logic to limit excess arrivals given large in-transit inventory.

Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2} (avg \u22481.625) so I let backend compute the average from observed lead times (method=calculate). Demand has sustained higher regime since Period 4 (P4\u2013P14 \u224811 periods); I use recent_N with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=476. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed sample avg \u22481.625) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 4 (higher demand through Period 15). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period realizations). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (regime from Period 4\u201315, 12 samples) so mu_hat reflects the sustained higher-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the confirmed higher demand while accounting for observed lead-time behavior and current in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=559. Historical concludes show actual lead times mix of 1 and 2 periods (recent concluded lead times: 2,2,1,2,1 -> avg\u22481.6). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 4 (sustained high demand through Period 16). To capture the shorter-than-constant promised lead-time signal I set L using recent lead-time observations. For demand and volatility I use recent samples from the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 4\u201316) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility reflective of the new regime and keeps safety stock aligned with current variability. These choices balance service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and high recent demand) against holding cost by using recent regime statistics rather than the low historical Jan baseline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 4 (sustained higher weekly demand ~187 units); recent pipeline is healthy (on-hand=86, in-transit=298). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132 periods) so I use the empirical average to capture actual variability. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend average the 10 observed concluded lead times (avg \u22481.6). For demand I use recent_N over the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 4\u201317, regime length=14) so mu_hat captures (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 14 demand samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=14 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align forecast and safety stock with the confirmed higher demand while using observed lead-time data to avoid under- or over-ordering given mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals.

Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (Period4\u201318 mean \u2248187 vs Jan baseline \u224867); I use the recent 15-period regime (Periods 4\u201318, 15 samples) for demand estimates. Observed concluded lead times (10 observations) average 1.6 periods, so I let the backend calculate L from observed lead times to capture the mixed 1\u20132 period reality. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility; this keeps orders aligned to current demand while the OR backend balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 4 and has been sustained through recent periods (use recent history). On-hand=0, in-transit=375 which should cover multiple periods given higher demand; many concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (1 or 2). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures actual 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (regime from Period4 onward length\u224816) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility. These choices aim to raise target base-stock to meet elevated demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=567. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods with no sustained shift beyond promised 2, so keep promised lead time. Demand regime increased and has been sustained since Period 4 (prior baseline \u224867 vs recent much higher mean \u2248187 through Period 20), so use recent demand samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. I select recent_N with N=17 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 4\u201320) so the OR engine's base-stock covers (1+L) periods of the new regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. These choices balance higher service level given elevated demand against holding cost by using recent empirical mean/variance rather than the stale January baseline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=567. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 period lead times (many 1s and 2s across history) so I'll let backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes. Demand has clearly shifted upward and the shift since Period 4 is sustained; recent 8-period average demand is ~178 units/week, so I'll base demand estimates on the recent regime (N=8) for both mean and volatility to reflect current higher demand and recent variability. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the elevated, persistent demand while L=calculate makes the controller use observed lead-time behavior rather than the promised value, helping cover pipeline uncertainty and overdue shipments.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (sustained through Period 22). On-hand=102, in-transit=375 -> ample pipeline but past periods show some delayed arrivals; concluded lead times (12 observations) average 1.583. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time (captures mix of 1\u20132 period deliveries). For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (regime from P4\u2013P22 is 19 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and reduce overweighting of the low-Jan baseline. Using recent samples helps the OR engine size the base stock to meet current demand while the calculated L accounts for observed faster-than-promised deliveries; sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility and prevents under-ordering during demand spikes.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent history (Periods 4\u201323) shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs Jan baseline; multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead times fluctuate between 1\u20132 periods but no persistent >2. On-hand=0, in-transit=429 (pipeline large). I choose to (1) infer lead time from observed concluded arrivals using the average of observed lead times to reflect mixed 1\u20132 performance (method=calculate); (2) set demand forecast using the recent high-demand regime (use recent_N with N=20 to capture Periods 4\u201323 sustained uplift); (3) set volatility from the same recent window (recent_N N=20) so the OR backend's base-stock and cap reflect the higher mean and realized variability. These choices balance service (capture sustained demand increase) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory\u2014recent-N estimates will let the backend reduce over-ordering compared to using older low baseline data.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand elevated vs Jan baseline but last several weeks show mid-hundreds per week (P20\u2013P24: 136,118,90,128,119). On-hand=0, in-transit=524 \u2014 pipeline is sizable but some prior orders experienced mixed 1\u20132 period lead times; average observed lead time ~1.6. To let the OR backend blend historical demand and observed lead-time variability, set L to the calculated average of observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service (given high in-transit) against holding cost while letting the engine apply its capped policy.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=524 (pipeline large but arrivals pending). Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime beginning around Period 4 that persisted; to capture the recent elevated demand I use a recent-window demand estimate. Use promised lead time (default L=2) because concluded lead-time observations remain mixed (1\u20132) and no new sustained shift in lead time is confirmed. mu_hat: recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to reduce costly stockouts given profit=holding ($1=$1), while using recent volatility to avoid excessive overstock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=470. Historical concluded lead times vary (1,2 and a recent 3 in Period26), suggesting occasional delays; demand regime increased and has been sustained since Period4 (carry-over notes). To be responsive to recent variability in lead time, set L by averaging the most recent lead-time observations. For demand I use a recent-window estimate to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (longer window to smooth week-to-week noise). Choices: L recent_N N=5 to weight latest lead-time behavior (captures the recent 3-period delay signal without overreacting); mu_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect the sustained elevated demand since Period4; sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters bias the base-stock upward to protect service level given observed demand uplift and occasional shipment delays while balancing holding cost via the OR engine's capped order.

Historical concluded lead times (13 observations) average \u22481.69 periods with recent variability including a 3-period delay; use calculated average to reflect observed reality rather than the promised 2. Demand regime shift beginning Period 4 has been sustained (higher mean since Period 4); use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new regime while smoothing noise. These choices (L=calculate, mu_hat recent_N N=20, sigma_hat recent_N N=20) let the OR backend size base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand under the confirmed higher-demand regime and account for observed lead-time drift, balancing service level vs. holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=502. Historical concludes show variable lead times including 1\u20133 periods with several delayed/no arrivals recently; to be conservative set lead time explicit=3. Demand has fallen since the earlier high regime \u2014 recent 7 periods (P22\u2013P28) show lower demand; use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new lower regime and recent volatility. These parameters reduce over-ordering given large in-transit while covering (1+L) periods of expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 22: avg demand P4\u2013P21 \u2248187 vs recent P22\u2013P28 mean \u224888.7 (\u2248-53%); sustained for 7 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has settled into the lower regime since Period 22 (P22\u2013P29 avg \u224888.7). On-hand=0, in-transit=502 (large pipeline; some prior shipments have been delayed historically). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); last 5 observed concluded lead times = [3,2,1,2,1] \u2192 avg \u22481.8, so I use recent_N (N=5) for L to capture current shorter-than-promised variability. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (P22\u2013P28 regime length=7) so mu_hat reflects the recent lower-demand regime. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 to match volatility in that same recent regime. These choices keep the base-stock tied to the current lower-demand regime while using a recent average lead time to avoid over-ordering despite large in-transit volume; they balance service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=470. Recent demand regime is the lower post-Period22 level (~89/week); recent weekly demands (P24\u2013P30) ~119,74,56,71,73,63,70 (mean \u224878). Observed concluded lead times recently show a rise to 3 in two latest conclusions (orders from P23->P26 and P27->P30) but earlier periods mix 1\u20133; in-transit is large so avoid inflating demand forecast. I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times to let the backend adapt to the apparent increase without overcommitting. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use a recent-window forecast covering the recent lower-demand regime (N=7 weeks P24\u2013P30) so (1+L) scales the recent mean and std; this keeps orders aligned to current lower demand and reduces holding cost risk given large in-transit stock.

Recent concluded arrivals show lead times rising to 3 periods (arrivals in P26 and P30 had lead_time=3); I use a short recent average to capture this shift. Demand has declined since the earlier high regime (carry-over notes) starting ~P22; to reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility using the last 9 samples to smooth short noise while focusing on the new regime. These settings raise the review+lead demand forecast to cover (1+L) periods with an updated lead estimate so the OR backend's capped order respects pipeline and service level while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has shifted down since Period 22: P22\u2013P32 demand mean \u224876.6 (11 samples). Multiple historical arrivals show variable lead times (observed lead times: 1\u20133 periods). To capture the true lead-time behavior I ask the backend to calculate average observed lead time from concluded messages (method=calculate). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (covering the sustained lower-demand regime P22\u2013P32) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 11 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=11 to reflect current volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while letting the backend account for the empirically observed lead-time distribution and protect against overdue/lost shipments.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=470. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead times have stretched to 3 periods in several recent shipments (arrivals in P26 and P30 from orders in P23 and P27). Demand regime changed down starting Period 22: P22\u2013P28 mean \u224888.7 and most recent weekly demand (P29\u2013P33 = 63,70,52,47,69) centers ~60\u201370. To reflect longer observed lead times while anchoring demand to the recent lower regime, I set L using recent lead-time observations (recent_N=3) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent demand regime (recent_N=12) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility. This balances service (accounting for occasional 3-period leads) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent concluded lead-times show a shift toward longer deliveries (recent concluded LT sequence: 2,3,3 \u2192 avg \u22482.67). Recent demand regime has dropped since Period 22 (P22\u2013P28 regime length=7) \u2014 last 7 demands mean \u224860 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=470 (large pipeline covering multiple review+lead periods). To avoid additional ordering while pipeline is ample, set L using recent_N to capture recent longer lead-times (N=3). Forecast demand using recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (N=7). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce reorder aggressiveness given large in-transit stock and a sustained lower-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=470. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but two of the three most recent concluded arrivals had lead_time=3 (Period30 and Period26) and the prior was 2 (Period22); I use recent_N for L to bias toward the latest stretch. Large in-transit (470) already covers multiple periods of demand, so use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let backend scale recommended order conservatively and avoid excess holdings. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and uncertain but slightly lengthening lead times.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=470. Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133), with recent observed lead times = [2,3,3]; average of last 3 \u22482.67 so I set L via recent_N to 3-sample average to bias toward the longer recent delays. Demand regime dropped starting ~Period 22 and has remained lower for many periods; use recent_N demand estimate covering the full low-demand regime (Periods 22\u201336, 15 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower mean and volatility. These choices make the OR backend target a lower base-stock (reducing holding cost) while acknowledging prolonged lead times (prevents stockouts from under-ordering given in-transit uncertainty).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has fallen from prior highs; last 8 periods (P30\u2013P37) mean \u224849.75 units/week. Multiple past orders experienced stretched lead times (observed 3-period arrivals in P26 and P30) and there is a large in-transit batch (470 units) not yet observed as concluded. To protect service while acknowledging slower demand and delayed arrivals, I set lead time explicitly to 3 (reflecting observed 3-period shipments). I forecast demand using the recent 8-week regime (recent_N N=8) to capture the lower current demand, and estimate volatility from the same 8-week window (recent_N N=8). These choices keep the backend\u2019s base-stock tied to current low demand while the longer L accounts for delayed shipments so the order quantity calculation will avoid over-ordering during in-transit arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=470. Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133 periods); recent concluded arrivals absent for many weeks but several past orders did conclude with mixed L. Demand has fallen materially since late summer. To be robust to observed lead-time variability I use 'calculate' for L (backend will average observed lead times). Recent demand (Periods 31\u201338) is much lower than earlier regimes, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the current low-demand regime and reduce overstocking given equal profit and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 31: P31\u2013P38 mean=45.9 vs prior P22\u2013P30 mean=82.7 (\u2248-44.5%), sustained 8 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand regime is the lower regime starting Period 31 (P31\u2013P39 mean \u224845.9, sustained 9 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=470 (large pipeline but many arrivals still unconcluded recently); historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133 periods) so I rely on observed average. Set L by calculating average observed lead time to reflect realized variability. Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor demand forecast to the most recent low-demand regime (covers P31\u2013P39). This reduces overstating demand from earlier higher regimes and prevents excess holding cost given holding=profit. These parameters balance service vs holding cost by using realized lead time while forecasting with the recent low-demand regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=470 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed average \u22481.79 periods) with occasional 3-period delays; therefore set L by calculate to use the average observed lead time. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 31 (P31\u2013P40 average \u224846); I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast and volatility to the most recent 10 periods (the detected regime). These choices reduce inventory risk given substantial in-transit stock while matching lower recent demand; using the calculated L aligns promised lead time with observed behaviour so the backend\u2019s base-stock and cap calculations reflect actual delay patterns.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent realized demand has been low (~30\u201360/week) after earlier high regimes; on-hand=0, in-transit=470. Observed concluded lead times (from conclude history) average \u22481.8 periods (mix of 1\u20133), so I use 'calculate' to let backend use the empirical average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples given no new sustained demand regime since the last recorded insights. This balances service vs holding cost while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=470. Historical concludes show variable actual lead times (1\u20133) and multiple past demand regime shifts; most recent sustained regime is Periods 31\u201338 (low demand, mean \u224845.9) with Periods 39\u201342 showing some fluctuation but not a sustained new regime. I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded history (captures variability vs promised=2). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the most recent confirmed low-demand regime (Period31\u201338 length=8); this keeps base-stock conservative and reduces holding exposure given profit=holding cost, while still covering expected short-term demand. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments here; using calculated L lets backend internalize realized lead-time behavior.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 31 (avg \u224850.6 over P31\u2013P43). On-hand=0, in-transit=470 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times recently include multiple 3-period arrivals (e.g., P26 from P23, P30 from P27) indicating actual lead time has stretched above the promised 2. To protect service while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding, I set L using recent observed lead times (average of last 3) so the OR backend will account for the longer realized lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the current low-demand regime (13 most recent periods P31\u2013P43) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower mean and variability; this pairs with the large in-transit quantity to avoid aggressive replenishment.

Many past lead times varied (1\u20133); to be robust I let backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). Demand forecast should reflect the recent low regime (use recent_N over the most recent 14 periods P31\u2013P44) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets avoid overstocking given holding cost equals profit.

Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=470. Historical concluded lead-times show multiple observations (1,2,3), average \u22481.83 \u2014 close to but slightly under promised 2; choose calculate to let backend use observed average. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 31 (P31\u2013P45 length=15, mean \u224845.9) with one isolated spike (P42=130). To avoid chasing the single spike and to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (use last 15 demand samples = Period31\u2013Period45). This keeps base_stock aligned with recent demand while accounting for recent variability; using recent_N for sigma captures current volatility. These choices help the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding (q=0.5).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=470. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed W values: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,3,3; avg\u22481.79) and recent demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 31 (many consecutive low weeks, with one isolated spike at P42). Several earlier orders experienced delays but most concluded; pipeline=470 likely covers upcoming demand. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the empirical average lead time (captures the observed 1.79 periods vs promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (Period31\u201346) because the regime shift to lower demand is sustained; this focuses mu_hat on the current low-demand regime ((1+L) scaling will be applied by backend). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=16 to reflect current volatility rather than older high-variance periods. These choices reduce overstocking risk given the lower recent demand while acknowledging slightly shorter inferred lead time from observed concludes; they balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.
