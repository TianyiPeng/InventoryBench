Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals; historical weekly demand samples (100,66,70,62,53) show no sustained changepoint. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level implied by profit/holding with historical demand given no new evidence or seasonality.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent observed demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean ~70.2. Period 1 showed demand=41 and the order placed in P1 (100 units) has not concluded as arrived yet; with promised lead time=2 and no concluded arrivals we cannot infer a lead-time change. On-hand=0, in-transit=100 (expected to cover upcoming periods if lead time holds). Use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand stats so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (via backend q) against holding cost while awaiting confirmed arrival evidence.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed weekly demands (history) average ~70.2 units; one recent high week (107) but no sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=199 (matches orders from P1+P2). No concluded arrivals yet to infer lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default=2) and default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding given single high-week spike but otherwise stable history.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) mean=70.2 units, std\u224815.93. All orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded by Period 4 (no arrivals observed in conclude messages), indicating actual lead time is longer than the promised 2 periods. To hedge against delayed/lost shipments, I set lead time explicitly to 3 periods. With L=3, the review+lead horizon =4 periods, so I forecast mu_hat = 4 \xd7 mean = 280.8 units. I set sigma_hat to \u221a(1+L)\xd7std = 2\xd715.93 = 31.86 to reflect aggregated volatility. These parameters increase on-hand coverage to protect service level given shipment delays while the holding cost ($1) is small relative to profit ($19), so biasing toward higher service is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Delayed shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 did not arrive by Period 4 conclude (expected arrival by Period 3 under promised L=2); evidence of lead-time >2.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent weekly demand samples average ~70.2 units/week (samples: 100,66,70,62,53). Current inventory: on-hand=16, in-transit=235. One concluded arrival (Period 4) shows the P2 order arrived with lead_time=2, matching promised L=2; P1 order remains unconfirmed (possible lost/delayed) but this is a single-period anomaly, not yet a sustained shift. I therefore keep L at the promised/default to avoid overreacting to a single missing arrival. Demand forecast uses the full-sample default: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean_all_samples to capture the established baseline (1+2=3 review+lead coverage). Volatility uses the full-sample default to reflect historical variation scaled for review+lead. These defaults balance service (covering 3 periods of average demand) against holding cost given relatively low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent history: on-hand=0, in-transit=282. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01) mean ~70.2, std ~15.9. Arrival history: order placed P2 arrived with lead_time=2 (P4 conclude), but order placed P3 (84 units) had not arrived by P5 conclude (arrived=0) indicating intermittent delays. To be conservative yet anchored to observed data, set L by calculate (average observed lead times = 2). Use default demand scaling so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of all samples to reflect steady weekly baseline and capture review+lead period demand. Use default sigma_hat to scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service (use observed lead time and full-sample demand mean) while avoiding overreacting to possibly lost shipments; in-transit =282 provides buffer but OR backend will compute base stock and cap using these inputs.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed additional delayed shipment: order placed on Period 3 (84 units) did not arrive by Period 5 conclude (overdue), indicating intermittent lead-time >2 for some shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=246. History shows mixed observed lead times: one arrival with lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4) and one with lead_time=1 (P5\u2192P6); some earlier orders delayed. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures intermittent shortening/lengthening). Demand forecast and volatility use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014keeps forecast anchored to full history given limited data while letting computed L adjust the review+lead horizon. This balances service (by adapting lead-time) vs holding cost (by not overreacting to recent spikes).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=334. Historical demand samples mean=70.2/week (5 samples). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: order from P2 arrived with lead_time=2, order from P5 arrived with lead_time=1; several earlier orders remain unreturned. Given variable/uncertain lead time but with two observed lead-time values, use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand forecast uses all historical samples (no clear sustained demand regime shift) so use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat to reflect full-sample mean and volatility across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service (use observed lead-time average) against holding cost given high in-transit stock and moderate weekly demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/08 (Period 9). Recent demand has stepped up vs. Jan baseline: latest demands (Periods 6-8) = [147,177,101], indicating a higher short-term regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=286 (large pipeline, some shipments historically delayed). Lead-time observations from concluded arrivals: {2,1,2,1} \u2192 mean ~1.5; I use the observed average rather than promised to let the backend adjust review+lead demand. For demand forecast I focus on the most recent regime (Periods 6-8) where demand is elevated, so I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher mean. Volatility likewise set from the same recent 3 periods to reflect current variability. These choices prioritize meeting elevated near-term demand while the large in-transit volume and using recent data limit excess holding cost build-up.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=0, in-transit=491. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: observed lead_times = [2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 2 (P6->P8), 1 (P7->P8)] \u2192 average 1.5. Demand has a sustained uptick beginning Period 6 (demands: P6=147, P7=177, P8=101, P9=85); recent regime length = 4. To capture current actual lead-time behavior and the recent higher-demand regime, I set L by averaging the last 4 observed lead times (recent_N, N=4). I set mu_hat using the mean of the last 4 demand observations (recent_N, N=4) to reflect the post-changepoint demand level over the review+lead horizon. I set sigma_hat using the std of the last 4 demands (recent_N, N=4) to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters prioritize service under the confirmed higher demand while avoiding inflating safety stock from older low-demand history.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): recent demand sample history shows high weekly demand variability (samples in history: 100,66,70,62,53 and game demands showing large swings). Current inventory: on-hand=172, in-transit=247. Historical concluded lead times (from conclude messages) alternate between 1 and 2 periods; average ~1.5. Several earlier periods showed delayed/missing arrivals but recent concludes show arrivals with lead times 1\u20132, no sustained >2 confirmation. To be robust to intermittent delays while letting the OR engine use observed lead-time behavior, I set L to be the calculated average of observed lead times. For demand and volatility I use the backend defaults so base_stock uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L); this balances service level (using observed lead time) against holding cost given currently large on-hand + in-transit. If shipments become persistently later than promised, future periods should switch to explicit longer L.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-04-29. Recent history shows a sustained, higher demand regime since Period 4 (8 periods of elevated demand) and intermittently variable lead times (observed 1 and 2 periods). On-hand=52, in-transit=247 (pipeline=299) so we have coverage now but must size orders to the new higher demand. Set L by 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1/2 observations). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=8 (the detected new regime from Period 4\u201311, N= max(min(8,20),3)=8) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the elevated recent demand, improving service while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 4 (Periods 4\u201311): recent avg demand=108.5 vs prior baseline\u224870.2 (+55%); sustained for 8 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 4 (Periods 4\u201311 avg=108.5 vs prior \u224870.2). Pipeline is large (in-transit=379) but on-hand=0; some earlier shipments were delayed but concluded lead-times observed = {2,1,2,1,2,1} so average observed LT\u22481.5. Set L method to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times average (captures intermittent delays without hard-coding). For demand, use recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 4\u201311) when computing mu_hat across review+lead period. Use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices bias orders upward to meet the confirmed higher demand while using observed lead-time average to avoid overreacting to isolated late shipments.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent sustained demand regime since Period 4: avg demand \u2248108.5 (Periods 4\u201311) vs prior \u224870.2 (+55%). On-hand=0, in-transit=433 (large pipeline). Concluded lead-time observations are mixed (1 and 2 periods); no sustained >2 confirmation. I set L using calculate (average of observed concluded lead times) so the backend infers the effective lead time from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 4\u201313) so mu_hat reflects the (1+L)-period demand under the new regime. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=10 to reflect variability in the same recent regime. This keeps orders responsive to the confirmed higher demand while the backend uses calculated L to adapt to observed concluded lead times and avoids overreacting to intermittent delays.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (recent avg \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870.2, sustained through Period 14). On-hand=58, in-transit=301 provides large pipeline cover; some earlier shipments were delayed but recent concluded arrivals show lead times of [2,1,2,1,2] (last 5). To reflect the sustained demand increase use a recent_N demand forecast (N=11 periods of the new regime). For lead time, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent observed average (~1.6) rather than the promised 2. For sigma, use recent_N (N=11) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices balance higher service needs from the demand shift while acknowledging recent, slightly-shorter-than-promised lead times and avoiding excess holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time recent average ~1.6 periods (last 5 observed concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2]); demand regime shift from Period 4 persists (Periods 4\u201314: recent avg demand\u2248108.5 vs prior\u224870.2, +55%).

Demand regime shift (Periods 4\u201315) persists: sustained higher demand (~108.5 vs ~70 prior). I set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect observed recent lead-time behavior rather than the promised 2. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=12 (Periods 4\u201315) to capture the sustained higher mean and variance in the new demand regime. These choices bias base-stock up to meet higher demand while recognizing slightly shorter recent lead times and elevated variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=400. Historical concluded lead_times show a mix of 2s and 1s with recent pattern ~1.6 (last 5 concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2]) and several past delayed/overdue arrivals\u2014so use recent lead-time estimate rather than promised. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 4 and has persisted (Periods 4\u201316 recent avg \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870), so base-stock should use recent demand history to capture the higher level and elevated variability. Choices: L recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent realized lead-time mix; mu_hat recent_N (N=11) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across the most recent ~11 periods; sigma_hat recent_N (N=11) to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders upward to avoid stockouts under the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in mind via the OR backend's service-level cap.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10): demand regime uplift persists since Period 4 (recent avg \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870, +~55%). Observed concluded lead_times show intermittent but shorter-than-promised arrivals (recent sequence [2,1,2,1,2] \u2014 recent average \u22481.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=327 (sizable pipeline). To capture confirmed higher demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent regime samples (recent_N) across the sustained up-shift (Periods 4\u201317). For lead time, use recent_N over last 5 observed lead_time conclusions to reflect the shorter effective lead time while still accounting for variability. These choices raise target base-stock to meet the elevated demand while using a shorter recent L to avoid overstock given large in-transit volume.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Demand has remained in the higher regime that began in Period 4 (recent weekly avg \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870; elevated demand persists through Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=424 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead_times (most recent 5) = [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 recent average \u22481.6, so I use recent_N for L to reflect actual shorter recent lead-time vs promised 2. For demand I use recent_N with N=15 covering the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 4\u201318) so mu_hat reflects the new mean over that regime. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=15 to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices help the OR backend size base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while using the shorter inferred lead time to avoid excess safety stock given holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Demand has remained in the elevated regime that began in Period 4 (recent avg ~108.5 vs prior ~70). Current inventory: on-hand 0, in-transit 328 units (pipeline large). Observed concluded lead times fluctuate 1\u20132 with recent average ~1.6. To reflect the empirically shorter-than-promised behavior while remaining robust to variability, I set L via recent_N over the last 5 observed lead-times (captures the latest lead-time mix). For demand I use recent_N over the sustained elevated regime (Periods 4\u201319, regime length 16) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher mean and volatility; this helps the OR backend size base stock to meet higher demand while capping orders via its internal cap to limit risk given existing large in-transit stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Demand has stayed in the elevated regime since Period 4 (recent avg \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870, ~+55%). On-hand=0, in-transit=441 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead_times show variability but recent average ~1.6 (from last 5 concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2]). To capture persistent higher demand I use recent_N demand estimates over the sustained regime (Periods 4\u201320, length 17). For lead time I use recent_N over the last 5 observed lead times to reflect the recent intermittent faster/slower arrivals. Sigma uses the same recent regime window to reflect realized volatility under the new demand level. These settings bias the OR backend toward stocking for the higher sustained demand while accounting for slightly shorter recent effective lead time and observed variability; large in-transit stock will reduce immediate ordering but the elevated mu_hat preserves service-level against continued high demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historical data and prior carry-over show a sustained demand regime shift since Period 4 (recent avg \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870.2, +55%). Lead-time observations have fluctuated but recent concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 avg \u22481.6; shipments have sometimes been delayed. To reflect the recent lead-time behavior I set L using recent_N on the last 5 observed lead times. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime and its recent variability, I use recent_N on the last 10 demand samples for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent high-demand regime. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given strong sustained demand while using recent sigma to size safety stock against variability; using recent lead-time average accounts for intermittent faster arrivals without trusting promised L=2 fully.

Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=395. Historical concluded lead-times show recent variability but last 5 observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 recent average \u22481.6, so use recent_N for L to capture this shorter effective lead-time. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 4 and has persisted through Period 22 (sustained higher mean); use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime (Periods 4\u201322, N=19) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to meet elevated demand while keeping cap constraints. These choices balance higher service level for the sustained +55% demand regime while reflecting the recent, slightly shorter lead-time pattern and observed volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 4 (recent avg \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870). On-hand=0, in-transit=404 (large pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals show mixed lead-times (1\u20132), average ~1.54; some shipments were delayed earlier but recent pattern is stable. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time from concluded arrivals (captures mixed 1\u20132 behavior). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the last ~20 samples to reflect the +55% shift). For sigma I use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility in the higher-demand regime. These choices aim to size base stock to serve the sustained elevated demand while recognizing the observed shorter-than-promised lead times and the large in-transit buffer.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Demand has sustained a higher regime since Period 4 (avg ~108.5) vs prior baseline ~70.2 (+~55%). On-hand=0, in-transit=465 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are observed with variable lead times. Recent observed lead times fluctuate around 1.5\u20131.6; to be conservative use the empiric average of observed lead times. Set demand forecast using the recent high-demand regime (use recent_N over the large, sustained regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean and volatility. These choices bias orders toward servicing the persistent higher demand while the OR backend will cap orders by its cap parameter to limit holding cost exposure.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 4 and has persisted (Periods 4\u201325 average demand ~108 vs prior ~70, ~+55%). Observed concluded lead times are intermittent (mix of 1 and 2), average ~1.54 \u2014 shipments sometimes delayed but no sustained >2 confirmed. On-hand=0, in-transit=465 (large pipeline). To prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand regime while accounting for intermittent delays, I set L to be calculated from observed concluded lead times (uses empirical avg). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to focus the forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand recent regime (caps N to recent window to reflect persistent higher mean/variance). This balances higher service level (captures increased demand) while keeping holding exposure moderated by using empirical volatility and the OR engine's cap.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=16, in-transit=389. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (recent avg ~108.5 vs baseline ~70.2, sustained >20 periods). Observed concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,2,1,3] (14 obs), avg \u22481.64 with occasional 3-period delays. To capture persistent higher demand use a recent-window forecast; to reflect variable but average lead time use calculated average from observed lead times so the backend accounts for actual pacing and occasional delays. Methods chosen: L=calculate to use observed lead-time average; mu_hat=recent_N N=20 to project (1+L)*mean over the sustained elevated-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in that same recent regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost while letting OR backend use averaged lead-time information to size pipeline replenishment.

Historical conclude messages show lead time variability but recent observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 short-run avg \u22481.6; demand regime shift (Periods 4\u201314 and ongoing) persists with higher mean (~108.5 vs prior ~70). To balance service and holding cost: set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent realized lead-time mix; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 to use the sustained higher-demand regime (use a long recent window capped at 20 to capture current elevated mean and volatility). These choices help the OR backend raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering for sporadic long delays.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=440. Historical concludes show intermittent delayed shipments but carry-over indicates recent average lead_time \u22481.6 (last 5 observed = [2,1,2,1,2]) and a sustained higher-demand regime (avg \u2248108.5 since Period 4). To reflect the verified shorter recent lead-time signal while hedging against occasional delays, I set L using recent_N on the last 5 observed lead-times. For demand I use a recent_N window to capture the persistent elevated regime (use the most recent 20 demand samples capped by the rule) and match sigma to the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher sustained demand while not over-allocating for obsolete baseline demand, and they incorporate recent lead-time behavior so the OR backend's base-stock calculation better balances service level (profit=$19) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime since Period 4 (carry-over: recent avg \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870.2, +55%) and that elevated demand persists through latest periods (several large demands in Periods 28\u201329). Pipeline is large (in-transit=455) but on-hand=0. Lead-time observations in concluded history show short/intermittent variability (recent observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2]); I use a recent average to reflect that the actual lead time is slightly below the promised 2 on average while still allowing for occasional delays. For demand I use a recent-window estimate to capture the persistent higher-demand regime and recent spikes. Sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices aim to set a base-stock that covers (1+L) periods of the elevated demand while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability; using recent lead-time and demand windows helps the OR backend avoid underordering given the regime shift and also avoids excess holding given the large pipeline.

Overdue/lost shipments occurred earlier but recent concluded lead_times suggest average ~1.6; however use backend's robust averaging for lead time. I set L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times average. Demand is in a sustained higher regime; use recent_N to focus forecast on the latest elevated demand (N=20 to capture the most recent large sample while smoothing noise). Volatility similarly estimated from the same recent window (N=20). These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand (raising base_stock) while relying on backend caps to limit over-ordering given inbound pipeline of 479 units.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Demand regime shift since Period 4 persists (sustained higher demand vs baseline). On-hand=0, large in-transit=511 (covers multiple periods). Lead times have been variable (1\u20133) but recent carry-over concluded average ~1.6; no new sustained lead-time shift confirmed. I choose promised lead time to keep OR aligned with supplier contract and historical variability. For demand I use a recent-window to capture the sustained higher regime: recent_N with N=20 to emphasize the last 20 samples (captures current elevated mean and variance). For sigma I also use recent_N N=20 to reflect current volatility. These settings help the OR backend size the base stock for the higher-demand regime while relying on in-transit stock to buffer intermittent delays.

Historical concluded lead_times show variability but recent observed lead_times (last 5) average ~1.6 \u2014 evidence actual LT often < promised 2 but intermittent delays exist; use recent_N to capture this. Demand regime shift starting Period 4 persists (elevated demand \u2248108.5/week); use recent_N over the recent regime to scale (1+L)\xd7mean. Choose L recent_N N=5 to weight most recent LT behavior; choose mu_hat recent_N N=20 and sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to base forecast/volatility on the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing noise. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit volume and variable lead times.

Observed concluded lead-times are variable but recent samples show shorter-than-promised on average.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 4 (recent avg \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870.2, +55%). On-hand=0, in-transit=529 (large pipeline). Recent observed lead_times are variable but recent sample indicates average ~1.6; therefore set lead time estimate using the last 5 observed lead_times. For demand I use a recent_N window covering the confirmed higher-demand regime; cap at 20 periods of recent data to capture sustained shift while smoothing noise. Sigma (volatility) should match the same recent window to reflect current variation. These choices bias the OR base_stock upward to meet the sustained higher demand while using pipeline inventory to avoid over-ordering given intermittent delayed shipments.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 4 (sustained +55% vs pre-Period-4); on-hand=0 with in-transit=529 (large pipeline, some shipments previously delayed). Several concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133), so I use the observed-average lead time rather than the promised default to reflect intermittent delays. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set demand estimates using the most recent regime data (use last 20 samples to stabilize estimate while emphasizing recent behavior). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices (L=calculate, mu_hat recent_N N=20, sigma_hat recent_N N=20) aim to keep base-stock aligned to the sustained higher demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand regime shift since Period 4 persists (sustained higher demand; recent avg \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870). Pipeline shows 432 in-transit and on-hand 0; history contains intermittent delayed shipments (lead times observed 1\u20133, sometimes > promised 2). To capture true operational lead-time variability I request the backend compute average observed lead time (method=calculate). For demand I bias estimates to the confirmed elevated regime using recent data: use the last 20 demand samples to form mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures recent mean/volatility while smoothing older baseline). This balances service (higher mu_hat to cover elevated demand and intermittent delays) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute z* and a capped order; sigma_hat recent_N ensures safety stock reflects recent variability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has remained in the elevated regime that began in Period 4 (recent avg \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870). On-hand=0, in-transit=522 \u2014 large pipeline but arrivals have historically been variable (observed lead_times show 1\u20133 periods). I choose L=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed concluded lead times (captures variable actual lead time vs promised). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to anchor mu_hat on the sustained high-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to reflect recent elevated mean over the review+lead period). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher sustained demand while letting the backend internal service-level math trade off holding cost vs stockouts.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 4 (carry-over indicates ~+55% sustained). On-hand=0, in-transit=432 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); recent observed average \u22481.6 (last 5). To capture persistent shorter-than-promised but variable lead time I set L using recent_N (N=5). To reflect the sustained higher demand regime and emphasize recent behavior, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures recent 8-period demand average/volatility). These choices steer the OR backend to size base stock for the (1+L) review+lead period using recent elevated demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and current large in-transit volume.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Demand regime shift that started in Period 4 persists (sustained higher demand vs baseline). Large in-transit balance (438) exists but on-hand=0. Lead times have been intermittent but multiple concluded observations exist; let backend compute the avg observed lead time. For demand I use the most recent regime data (capture sustained higher mean/volatility) using the last 20 periods to reflect the persistent elevated demand while smoothing noise. These settings prioritize meeting higher ongoing demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding given substantial pipeline.

Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=501. Historical concludes show variable lead times (1\u20133) with recent variability; demand has remained in the elevated regime (~110\u2013120 recent weeks). To capture recent lead-time variability and the sustained higher demand, I use recent_N on both lead time and demand estimates using the last 5 observations: L: recent_N (average of last 5 observed lead times) to reflect recent delivery behavior; mu_hat: recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demand samples (captures current elevated regime); sigma_hat: recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility. These choices balance service (respond to higher recent demand) while limiting excess inventory given observed lead-time noise and holding cost=$1/unit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=495. Historical concludes show intermittent delayed shipments but recent observed lead times have averaged ~1.6 (last 5 observed = [2,1,2,1,2]), so I use recent_N for L to capture the short-term realized lead time. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 4 (sustained +55% vs baseline); to capture the persistent elevated demand I use recent_N with a long window (capped at 20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base_stock reflecting the sustained higher mean and volatility. These choices balance service (by using a shorter, evidence-based L and demand-driven mu_hat) against holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime since Period 4 (recent average \u2248108.5 vs prior \u224870). On-hand=0, in-transit=495 (pipeline sizable). Observed lead-times show variability but recent concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 average ~1.6. To reflect persistent higher demand I use a recent-window demand estimate (captures post-changepoint behaviour) and to capture recent lead-time mix I average the last 5 observed lead times. Settings chosen: L by recent_N (N=5) to reflect empirical recent lead-time average; mu_hat by recent_N (N=20) to use the most recent demand regime (capped at 20); sigma_hat by recent_N (N=20) to estimate volatility within the same recent regime. These parameters increase target base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over-ordering for sporadic long delays.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (sustained ~+55% vs baseline). On-hand=21, in-transit=432 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded lead_times show variability (1\u20133) with recent observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2] \u2192 recent mean ~1.6; some shipments have been delayed beyond promised L=2 intermittently. To reflect persistent higher demand while adapting to recent faster-than-promised arrivals, I set L by averaging the most recent observed lead times. For demand forecast I use a recent-window estimate to capture the sustained elevated regime; N capped at 20 to focus on the latest regime. Volatility likewise uses the same recent window. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the higher demand regime while the recent lead-time average reduces over-ordering risk from intermittent faster arrivals; given high profit vs holding cost (q\u22480.95) the backend will target a high service level but using recent demand/lead-time estimates reduces excess holding risk given current on-hand + large pipeline.

Historical concluded lead-times vary (1\u20133); recent observed average ~1.6. To respect observed lead-time variability while letting OR backend compute base_stock from data, I set L based on recent lead-time observations, use a recent-window demand forecast reflecting the sustained high-demand regime (20-week window capped per rule), and match sigma to the same recent window so variability reflects the current regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat for sustained elevated demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 46 (2019-12-23). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 4 (sustained +55% vs baseline); recent demand behavior should dominate forecasting. Pipeline shows 490 units in-transit and on-hand=0; some earlier shipments were delayed but recent concluded lead_times average ~1.6. I use L="calculate" so the backend estimates the empirical average observed lead time from concluded history (captures intermittent delays). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to focus the forecast on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (capped at 20 samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 20 demands). For volatility I use recent_N N=20 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices prioritize service during the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the backend's lead-time estimate account for observed shipment delays; capping recent samples at 20 avoids overreacting to single-week spikes.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-12-30: Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (persistent \u2191 ~+55% vs pre-periods). Pipeline=490, on-hand=0; significant in-transit stock reduces urgency but lead-time variability has occurred (confirmed recent concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2]). I choose L=recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent observed lead-time average (~1.6) rather than blindly using promised L=2. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing noise; (1+L) scaling will be applied by backend. These choices balance a high target service level (profit/holding \u2192 q\u22480.95) with observed lead-time intermittency and the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering.
