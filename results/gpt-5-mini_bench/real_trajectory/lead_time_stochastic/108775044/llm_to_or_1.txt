Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). Recent historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable low-mid 100s; no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2192 risk of stockout this period. No sustained changepoints or delays detected, so use promised lead time and population-wide demand stats: set L=default (promised 2), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service (covering review+lead period demand) against holding cost given symmetric profit/holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) average ~134. On-hand=0, in-transit=166 (order placed P1). No concluded arrivals beyond promised lead time observed, so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipment yet. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full history, balancing service vs holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=336 (orders 166+170). No concluded arrivals yet\u2014this matches promised lead time=2 (orders placed P1/P2 will arrive during P3/P4 and only be visible in concludes of P3/P4). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~134. I use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses promised L=2 and full-sample stats to compute base-stock and cap. This is conservative given no confirmed lead-time shift or sustained demand change and avoids overreacting to two periods of unobserved arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Demand history (weekly): 162,142,115,133,118 (mean=134). On-hand=0, in-transit=459 (large pipeline). Orders placed in Periods 1-3 have no arrivals recorded yet; cannot confirm actual lead time from concluded messages. To be conservative and let the OR engine use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats, I select default lead time and default demand/variability estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This leverages the large in-transit inventory while avoiding overfitting to the apparent missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (P1 ordered=166, P2 ordered=170, P3 ordered=123) have no concluded arrivals across three consecutive conclude messages \u2014 sustained missing/delayed shipments (possible lost shipments).

Daily Profit: $149.00, Daily Holding Cost: $21.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $128.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): on-hand=21, in-transit=298; recent conclude shows Period2 order arrived with lead_time=2 (consistent with promised L=2). Orders from P1 and P3 remain unconcluded but evidence is not yet sufficient to change lead-time estimate (could be lost shipments). Use promised lead time to let the OR backend apply its statistical policy. Demand history (5 weekly samples mean=134) and L=2 imply default (1+L)\xd7mean demand forecast; keep default volatility so backend computes safety stock. This balances service (use historical mean over a 3-period review+lead) while avoiding over-reacting to possibly lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=444. History shows one concluded arrival: Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2 confirmed for that shipment); several earlier orders (Periods 1 and 3) remain missing across multiple conclude messages, suggesting delayed/lost shipments. No sustained change in demand level is evident from the provided historical demand samples (mean=134 over five weekly samples). Given equal profit and holding costs (profit=holding), default safety factor logic is appropriate. Use promised lead time (default) so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat; this avoids overfitting to potentially incomplete arrival signals and lets the capped policy control order sizes against possible lost shipments.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=314. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: P2\u2192arrived in P4 (lead_time=2) and P5\u2192arrived in P6 (lead_time=1). Orders placed in P1-P3 (166,170,123) had no arrivals across three consecutive conclude messages, indicating sustained missing/delayed shipments. I set L to "calculate" so the backend averages observed lead times (captures the 1 and 2 period observations). I use mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so demand is anchored to all historical samples (mean=134) scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service vs holding given lead-time variability and the risk of lost shipments while relying on the full-sample demand estimate.

Carry-over insight: Sustained missing shipments: orders placed P1=166, P2=170, P3=123 had no concluded arrivals across three consecutive conclude messages (possible lost shipments).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand elevated (Periods 5-7: 138, 156, 182) and rising; on-hand=0, in-transit=461 (large pipeline, includes some delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods), so use a short recent average to reflect current variability. Use recent_N=3 for demand (focus on latest upward regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands) and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. Use recent_N=2 for L to reflect the two most recent observed lead times (1 and 2). This balances service (capture upward demand) while the large in-transit reduces urgency to over-order given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has spiked (last 5 period demands: 149,138,156,182,312; mean\u2248187). On-hand=0, in-transit=313 (covers part of expected demand but arrivals have been variable and some early orders went missing). Observed concluded lead times = {P2->4:2, P5->6:1, P6->8:2, P7->8:1} (varying between 1\u20132). I select L="calculate" so backend uses the average observed lead time (captures 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the clear recent upward regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility from the same window. These choices balance service (capture recent spike) versus holding cost given in-transit supply and lead-time variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): recent demand samples (Jan-Feb 2019) show stable avg ~134/wk; observed concluded lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods (evidence: P4: P2->2, P6: P5->1, P8: P6->2 & P7->1). There are prior sustained missing/delayed shipments but no new multi-period lost-shipment signal this period. I choose L='recent_N' using the last 4 observed lead-time realizations to capture the 1\u20132 period variability; mu_hat='recent_N' using last 5 demand samples (all available historical weekly samples) so the demand forecast uses the full sample while scaling with (1+L); sigma_hat='default' to let backend scale historic volatility by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (accounting for lead-time uncertainty) vs holding cost without overreacting to isolated delayed arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.5). On-hand=40, in-transit=332 (pipeline large relative to demand). Given alternating 1\u20132 period arrivals, I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect actual variability. Demand history (five samples mean=134) used by default (1+L) scaling is appropriate since no clear, sustained demand regime shift is visible. Using default sigma captures observed volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute base-stock that balances service level and holding cost while accounting for the inferred shorter-than-promised effective lead-time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=483. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times varying between 1 and 2 periods (observed arrivals: P2->2, P5->1, P6->2, P7->1, P8->2, P9->1). No sustained new lead-time regime or demand shift detected. To let the OR engine adapt to the mixed observed lead times I request the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded data. Use default demand and volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so forecasts reflect all historical samples. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding, while letting the backend cap orders per its cap rule.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=542; recent weeks (Periods 8-12) show elevated demand (312,207,225,273,270). Concluded arrivals show varying lead times (observed sequence 2,1,2,1,2,1) so I let the backend compute average observed lead time. To capture the recent demand surge I use a recent_N forecast (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base_stock reflects the higher recent mean while volatility is estimated from the same window. This balances higher service needs against holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1). No new evidence of a sustained regime change beyond previously recorded missing shipments.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=622. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed W\u2208{1,2}); recent conclusions include several L=2 observations (P11\u2192P13), so use averaged observed lead time to capture variability and potential delays. Demand history (weekly samples provided) used with default scaling to produce mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap consistently. This choice balances service (using empirically averaged L) against holding cost given profit=holding cost, while acknowledging prior sustained missing shipments\u2014we keep conservative L estimation by averaging observed lead times.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=563. Historical concluded arrivals show a mixture of 1- and 2-period lead times but majority are 2; several earlier orders (P1-P3) were sustained missing across multiple concludes. To reflect observed lead-time behavior I let the backend calculate L from observed lead times (captures recent 1 vs 2 mix). Demand historical samples (five weekly samples from Jan 2019) are limited; to avoid overfitting to recent volatile weeks I use default demand sizing and default volatility so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (captures longer observed lead times via calculate) against holding cost (default mu_hat avoids reacting to short-term spikes).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods in multiple concluded arrivals (examples: P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P8\u2192P10, P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14); observed lead times include occasional 1-period arrivals but overall mode=2.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=573. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time centered on 2 periods, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) is elevated vs. early-sample regime; use recent_N=5 to let mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime. This keeps base-stock responsive to current demand while limiting excess holding given profit=holding ($1:$1) which implies moderate service targeting.

Historical concluded arrivals show mode lead time = 2 and multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals; recent missing shipments earlier resolved. Demand history (weekly samples from 2019-01) shows high weekly demand (~160\u2013270). I choose promised lead time to keep model aligned with confirmed mode and because the pipeline is sizable. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level with holding cost given profit=holding cost and large in-transit inventory. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments now since recent concludes confirm lead_time=2 and arrivals have resumed.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=563. Recent concluded history shows mode lead time = 2 (multiple P\u2192P+2 confirmations) with occasional 1-period arrivals; no new sustained lead-time change or demand regime shift. Several past shipments were delayed/lost but recent concludes (e.g., P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14, P15\u2192P17) support using the promised lead time. I select default lead time to keep OR aligned with promise and recent evidence. For demand forecast and volatility I use default (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of provided historical samples to avoid overfitting to noisy recent spikes; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost. Current pipeline (563) is large, so conservative defaults prevent excess additional ordering while OR backend caps orders.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=596. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1\u20132 periods with mode=2; average observed lead time ~1.6. Demand training samples (provided) have mean=134, but recent realized weekly demand in game history has been much higher; using the backend defaults scales the (1+L) multiplier on the full-sample mean to capture elevated replenishment needs while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from historical variance. I choose L=calculate to let the backend use the observed lead-time history average, mu_hat=default to apply (1+L)*mean(all samples) so the base-stock reflects both review+lead demand, and sigma_hat=default so uncertainty is based on full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and recent high demand) against holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent history shows mostly stockouts with intermittent arrivals; on-hand=0, in-transit=563. Multiple concluded arrivals support an average lead time near 1.5 but mode=2 (sustained evidence). I choose L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures occasional 1-period but overall ~2). Demand forecast uses default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_of_all_samples based on full history; this is conservative given limited recent regime shifts and large in-transit volume. These choices balance service level (accounting for multi-period lead time) against holding costs given current large pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent realized demand remains elevated and variable (recent demands P16-P20 = 263,212,92,85,61). On-hand=0, in-transit=568 (large pipeline) but earlier history shows intermittent delayed/lost shipments; however lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods in prior concluded arrivals. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (2) while relying on recent demand to capture current regime. I choose mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to scale the (1+L) forecast to the most recent 5 observed demand periods (captures recent elevated average while limiting older low-season samples). sigma_hat=default lets the backend compute volatility from full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (use recent mean) against holding cost given already-large in-transit stock and confirmed L=2.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=568 (pipeline large but recent concludes show mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals and some missing shipments historically). Promised lead time=2 and prior concluded arrivals strongly support using promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting. Demand has varied; I use a recent demand estimate to capture the current regime. Set L using default (promised=2). Set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent 5 observed demand periods and scale by (1+L). Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend compute volatility from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (using recent demand) while avoiding overreaction to isolated late/missing arrivals.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has fallen vs early-year: last 5 demands (Periods 18-22) = [92,85,61,27,21], mean=57.2 over that window (sustained low over 5 periods). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 in concluded history. To protect service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I use promised/default L and base demand forecasts on the most recent regime (recent_N N=5) so mu_hat reflects the 3-period coverage (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent volatility over the same 5 periods. This also mitigates risk from prior missing shipments by relying on concluded arrivals (not assumed faster arrivals).

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent weekly demand has fallen from ~85 to ~19 over the last 5 periods (P19\u2013P23), so I forecast using the most recent regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=563 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrival timing uncertain; confirmed lead-time mode=2 previously so use promised lead time. Set L=default to respect promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (N=5 chosen = last 5 demand periods P19\u2013P23). This keeps target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while maintaining service given substantial in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has fallen sharply vs spring peaks: last 7 concluded weekly demands = [61,27,21,19,18,?]. On-hand=0, in-transit=563 (large pipeline) and several past shipments were delayed/lost but lead time mode=2. To avoid over-ordering given large pipeline and sustained low recent demand, set L=default (promised 2). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the backend forecast on the recent low-demand regime and reduce target base-stock and safety stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=563. Historical concluded arrivals show mode lead time = 2 (multiple confirmed P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P8\u2192P10, P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14) and intermittent 1-period arrivals; earlier sustained missing shipments were observed but later periods confirm lead time=2. I select L by 'calculate' (use observed lead times average) to let backend infer actual average; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and leverages full historical demand while respecting inferred lead time. No explicit upward adjustment despite past lost shipments because recent concluded arrivals consistently support L\u22482 and a return of supply.

Historical concluded arrivals show mode lead-time=2 and recent demand has fallen compared with early-year samples, but the provided baseline samples (Jan\u2013Feb) remain the primary seed. No sustained new changepoint since prior insights. Use promised lead time and baseline demand statistics so the OR backend applies its default base-stock calculation anchored to all samples; this avoids overreacting to short recent low-demand noise while accounting for the 2-period review+lead horizon.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-08-19 (P28). On-hand=0, in-transit=563 (large pipeline from earlier orders, some arrivals may still be in-transit or delayed). Recent demand has fallen sharply since late June/early July (Period21\u201327 demands: 27,21,19,18,27,16,12), indicating a new low-demand regime versus earlier spring peaks. Lead-time evidence in concluded history shows mode=2 and multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals; use promised/default L. To avoid overstocking given the large in-transit pipeline and much lower recent demand, forecast demand using a recent-window average to reflect the new low regime and reduce target base stock; use same recent window for volatility to capture lower recent variability. Methods chosen: L=default to respect confirmed mode=2; mu_hat=recent_N with N=7 (Periods 21\u201327) to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to compute recent volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=563. Historical concluded arrivals confirm mode lead time = 2 periods; however demand has shifted sharply downward since Period 18. I set L to default (promised 2) to align with confirmed lead-time messages. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 18\u201328) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new low-demand regime (avg \u224835 units/week) and reduce over-ordering given equal profit and holding cost. This keeps base-stock responsive to the sustained low demand while the OR backend caps order size to limit exposure to possible lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: avg demand fell from 217 (Periods 1\u201317) to 35 (Periods 18\u201328), \u221284%, sustained for 11 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 18 (avg \u2248 35/week, 11 periods). Lead time has been confirmed as mode=2 in concluded arrivals; no new sustained lead-time signal. On-hand=0, in-transit=563 \u2014 large pipeline expected to cover multiple weeks when it arrives. I therefore keep L at promised (default). For demand I use recent_N over the low-demand regime (N=11) so mu_hat reflects the (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 11 samples and sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. This reduces overordering versus using the high-demand historic mean while the large in-transit stock mitigates short-term stockouts.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent sustained demand regime shift since Period 18: demand collapsed and has remained low (Periods 18\u201330 avg ~18). On-hand=0, in-transit=563 \u2014 ample pipeline stock relative to current low-demand regime. Promised lead time=2 and prior conclude messages confirm mode=2, so use default lead time. To reflect the new low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-shift regime (N=13, Periods 18\u201330) so the OR backend forecasts for the current low mean and reduced volatility and avoids overordering despite large in-transit. This balances service level (use pipeline) vs. holding cost by relying on recent regime data rather than long-run pre-shift averages.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=563 (large pipeline). Lead time confirmed historically as 2 (mode) so use promised/default L to align with OR engine. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=14 (regime length since Period 18). This down-weights older high-demand data and prevents excessive replenishment given the large in-transit stock and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 18 (avg fell ~84% vs earlier), recent weekly demand (P18\u2013P32) is low and stable. On-hand=0, in-transit=563 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times (n=12) are mixed (1 and 2) with mode=2 and mean \u22481.58; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed variability. For demand forecast use the recent low-demand regime (Periods 18\u201332, regime length=15) so (1+L)\xd7mean computed from last 15 samples (recent_N) to capture the sustained lower demand. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=15) to reflect volatility in the current regime. These choices keep ordering conservative given large in-transit inventory while aligning service level to the low-demand regime and the observed lead-time mix.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded lead times confirm mode=2 periods; promised lead time=2. Given the sustained low-demand regime from Period 18\u201333 (regime length 16), I use recent_N over that regime so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the low current demand. I keep L as default (promised) because concluded evidence supports lead_time=2 and there are no new sustained lead-time changes. Using recent_N for mu and sigma focuses the OR base-stock on the current low-demand regime, avoiding excess holding cost while the large in-transit pipeline covers near-term demand.

Observed lead time has been confirmed as 2 in multiple concluded arrivals; promised lead time=2. To reflect the persistent low-demand regime I set L=default (use promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=17 (the length of the low-demand regime, 17 samples from Periods 18\u201334) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, which avoids being pulled by early high-demand samples and reduces unnecessary ordering given heavy in-transit inventory.

Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 18 (avg much lower since P18) and multiple concluded arrivals confirming actual lead time mode=2; no new sustained shipment losses observed recently. On-hand=0, in-transit=563. I set L to default (promised 2) because concluded arrivals support lead time=2. For demand I use recent_N with N=18 to capture the low-demand regime (Periods 18\u201335 length=18) so mu_hat reflects the current low mean across the review+lead period. For volatility I also use recent_N N=18 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices align the OR backend to the sustained low-demand regime while keeping lead time consistent with observed concluded arrivals.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime drop since Period 18 (confirmed in carry-over): low weekly demand (single- to low-double digits) vs. earlier high demand. Observed concluded lead times are variable but mode\u22482 and average ~1.58 periods; I choose to let the backend compute the empirical average (method=calculate). For demand I select recent_N using the post-changepoint regime (Periods 18\u201336, length=19) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained low-demand regime and avoid contamination from the earlier high-demand regime. This keeps base-stock conservative for current low demand while the OR engine uses promised lead time and stats to balance service vs. holding cost. No new evidence of additional lead-time shift or regime change in the last concluded periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 18 (sustained ~3\u20137 units/week most recent 20 weeks). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=563 units, which already covers many weeks of current low demand; past concluded arrivals confirm modal lead time=2. To avoid excess holding cost while honoring service, use promised lead time and base mu/sigma on the recent low-demand regime (last 20 samples) so the OR engine will target much smaller replenishment given the large pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Demand has been in a low regime since Period 18 (avg fell ~84% vs Periods 1-17) and recent 20 periods (P19-P38) show consistently low weekly demand (single- to double-digit). Historical concluded arrivals confirm mode actual lead time = 2 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=563 (large pipeline). To avoid overstock vs. low demand, keep promised lead time (default=2) and base demand forecast on the most recent low-demand regime: use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility reflecting the sustained low-demand period while accounting for the pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical data shows a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 18 (earlier carry-over). Recent 22-week window since Period 18 remains at the lower regime; I choose a recent-window capped at 20 periods to capture current low demand. Lead time historically mode=2 and promised=2, so keep default. Using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine forecast (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent stable low-demand regime, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and large in-transit (563 units) already in pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Demand regime collapsed after Period 17 (sustained low weekly demand ~3\u20138 units through Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=563 (large pipeline from prior orders; some historical shipments were delayed/lost but lead time has been repeatedly observed as mode=2). To avoid overstock vs. low demand, keep promised lead time and forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Choose L=default (use promised 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (Period 18+ length >20); this biases orders toward the current low-demand mean and its recent volatility, reducing excess inventory while covering (1+L) periods of demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime drop since Period 18 (lower weekly demand ~single digits) and large in-transit quantity (563) with past episodes of delayed/lost shipments. On-hand=0, pipeline=563 \u2014 expect incoming units but arrivals are only visible after conclude messages, so continue to account for observed lead-time behavior. I set L to "calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (captures the empirical ~1.6-period mode=2 behavior). For demand I keep the backend default scaling (mu_hat="default", sigma_hat="default") so mu and sigma are computed from all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding, and lets the OR engine temper orders given the large pipeline and uncertain arrivals.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 18 (sustained low weekly demand ~3\u201310 units). Lead time has been repeatedly observed at 2 periods (matches promised L=2). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=563 (expected arrivals will show up in future concludes); to avoid overstocking given holding cost = profit, I forecast using the recent low-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (use the last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps target base-stock aligned with the current low demand and reduces excess holding while preserving service given observed lead time.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 18 (weekly demands mostly single- to double-digit). On-hand=0, in-transit=563 \u2014 large pipeline present. Promised lead time=2 is appropriate (historical concluded arrivals mode=2). To avoid overstocking given holding cost equals profit, I base demand forecast on the most recent low-demand periods: use recent_N (N=10) to capture current regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. L kept as default (promised lead time=2) so OR backend accounts for contractual lead time while mu/sigma reflect the new low-demand regime, balancing service vs holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Set demand forecast using the recent low-demand regime (use last 20 periods to capture current mean/volatility).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 18 (sustained fall to single/double digits). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods in concluded history (multiple P->P+2 arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=563 (pipeline large). To respect confirmed lead time and recent low-demand regime, I use L=default (promised lead time=2). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime to avoid legacy high-demand bias: choose N=20 to cover the last ~20 weeks of low demand. Same recent_N N=20 for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices keep the backend's base-stock aligned with the current low-demand regime while accounting for the confirmed lead time and existing large in-transit pipeline, minimizing holding cost risk while preserving service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, In-transit=563 (sizable pipeline). Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift down around Period 18; recent demand much lower. Lead-time observations previously confirm mode=2 and promised lead time is 2, so use promised lead time. For demand forecast use the recent low-demand regime: pick recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=20 (captures the most recent stable low-demand periods while capping at 20). This balances service (capture recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock and equal profit/holding ($1/$1).
