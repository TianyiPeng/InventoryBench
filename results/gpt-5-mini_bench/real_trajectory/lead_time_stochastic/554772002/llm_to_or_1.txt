Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). SKU 554772002 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Historical weekly demand samples (early Jan\u2013Feb) show stable small series; no evidence of a sustained regime change or seasonal spike. Promised lead time used (default) since no actual lead-time observations exist. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-02-18. SKU 554772002 historical weekly mean=68.6 (5 samples); promised lead time=2. Period 1 conclude shows ordered=90 arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 insufficient evidence to change lead time (could be in-transit or delayed). On-hand=0, in-transit=90 vs expected (1+L)*mean \u2248 3*68.6=205.8 \u2192 pipeline short. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes base-stock given promised L and full-sample stats; this avoids overfitting to unconfirmed delays while letting OR plan replenishment to cover the 3-period demand window.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=183. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan 2019) show mean ~68.6. Period concludes show no confirmed arrivals yet; we lack concluded evidence to change promised lead time (promised L=2). Missing arrivals in recent concludes could be normal given lead-time timing and conclude delay, not yet a sustained loss signal. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (uses full-sample mean) against holding cost without overstating a regime shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=281 (orders 90+93+98 from Periods 1-3). Promised L=2 but no arrivals have concluded for three successive periods, indicating actual lead time exceeds promised. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed delay. With L=3 I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (mean demand=68.6 over five samples), which yields a multi-period forecast that increases order coverage for the longer lead time while the capped policy limits excess exposure to holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as >=3 periods: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (90, 93, 98; total 281) have no concluded arrivals by Period 3 conclude.

Daily Profit: $280.00, Daily Holding Cost: $23.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $257.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent concluded data shows an order placed in Period 2 (93 units) arrived in Period 4 \u2192 observed lead time = 2. On-hand=23, in-transit=285 but prior orders (Period1 and Period3) have no conclude records and may be lost or delayed. To be conservative and align with observed arrivals, set L using calculated average of observed lead times. Use default demand/volatility (backend: (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std) based on historical weekly samples (58,59,81,84,61) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost while the lead-time calculation captures true arrival pace and mitigates over-ordering against potentially lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period2 order: ordered=93 arrived=93 on Period4 => lead_time=2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=285. Historical concluded lead-time evidence: Period4 conclude shows Period2 order arrived with lead_time=2 (confirmed). Use lead time estimate based on observed data. Demand recent trajectory (Periods1-5 demands: 83,136,103,70,50) shows a downward shift from early spikes; to be responsive, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods so the OR engine sizes base-stock to the current lower demand level while accounting for variability. These choices balance service (use recent demand) vs holding cost (avoid overstock given falling demand).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Recent realized demands (P1-P6) show elevated but variable weekly demand; on-hand=0, in-transit=314 (covers upcoming demand partly). Observed concluded lead times: Period4 conclude shows arrival of order from Period2 with lead_time=2; no other concluded lead times. I set L using 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=2). For demand I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all historical samples) which leverages the provided 5-sample demand history and smooths toward baseline demand; sigma_hat='default' uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) to reflect amplified uncertainty over the review+lead period. These choices keep ordering responsive to the confirmed 2-period lead time while using full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to the recent volatile weeks, balancing service level (profit $4 vs stockouts) against $1 holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-01: recent on-hand=0, in-transit=314 (ample coverage). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-7): 83,136,103,70,50,77,110 \u2014 elevated and volatile versus Jan baseline. Concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4). No new sustained lost-shipment signal. I set L to default (promised lead time = 2) consistent with observed arrivals. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (captures recent higher mean and variability while limiting influence of earlier Jan samples). This raises the base-stock to protect service level given current pipeline and demand spikes while keeping holding cost in check by using a 5-period recent window rather than full-history smoothing.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent concluded history shows two confirmed lead times of 2 periods (Period2\u2192arrived Period4; Period6\u2192arrived Period8). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 285 (pipeline present but not yet observable in conclude messages). Given consistent evidence of actual lead time = 2 and limited data (weekly samples from Feb), use the backend's default demand aggregation over all samples to avoid overfitting. Using L=calculate would match observed average lead time; mu_hat/sigma_hat set to default let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost with the known profit/holding ratio.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 periods (P2->P4 and P6->P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=285 (multiple earlier orders still en route). Use promised/default lead time (2) since recent evidence confirms it. Demand has been variable but the last 5 realized weekly demands (Periods 5-9 = 50,77,110,85,62) represent the current regime; choose recent_N=5 to capture this recent mean/volatility. This yields mu_hat based on the 3-week review+lead horizon ((1+L)=3) \xd7 recent mean, and sigma_hat based on recent volatility to balance service level (profit/holding -> moderate service target) versus holding cost while accounting for observed variability and overdue pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=285. Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = 2 (Period2->4, Period6->8) \u2014 consistent recent evidence. Use calculated L (avg of observed lead times). Demand has risen recently (last 5 demands: 77,110,85,62,156; mean ~98) so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime and volatility. This raises (1+L)-period demand forecast to maintain high service given profit=$4 vs holding=$1 (high target service level), while sigma based on recent variability helps the OR backend size safety stock appropriately. No clear lost-shipment signal beyond earlier resolved delays.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been volatile with several stockouts (multiple demands >60 and spikes to 156). On-hand=0, in-transit=348 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals are observed with a 2-period pattern (Period2->4 and Period6->8). I set L to "calculate" so backend uses the average of observed concluded lead times (captures the confirmed 2-period reality). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as "default" so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this balances service (higher base_stock from L=2) against holding cost given a large in-transit position and profit/holding ratio.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=348. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 periods (Period2\u2192arrived P4; Period6\u2192arrived P8). Earlier multi-period non-arrivals appear resolved \u2014 no sustained >2 LT signal. Demand history shows high variability with recent large weekly demands (e.g. 156, 136, 110, 105, 95). To balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1, use observed LT estimate and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance while accounting for L. This keeps ordering conservative given volatile demand and substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=285. Concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead_time=2 (Period2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13), so use calculated lead time. Recent realized weekly demand (periods 1\u201313) is materially higher than the older 5-sample baseline, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 13 samples to capture the current demand regime and volatility. This raises the (1+L) forecast and uncertainty, which increases target base-stock to protect service given observed delays while keeping holding cost in mind.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=325. Historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 2 periods (multiple orders: P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13). Demand has been volatile with elevated recent weeks (e.g., P7..P14: 110,85,62,156,105,95,90,106). To adapt to the recent demand regime while respecting the promised lead time, I set L=default (use promised 2). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 8 observed demands, capturing the recent higher mean. I keep sigma_hat=default so the backend uses overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (respond to recent demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

On-hand=0, in-transit=344 (sizable pipeline arriving per promised lead time). No clear sustained demand regime shift since initial samples; use backend defaults to let OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from available demand history.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent weekly demand has been elevated and variable (recent demands: P12-16 = 95,90,106,102,128). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 344 (sufficient pipeline but arrival confirmations lag by 1 period). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 2-period lead time (Period2->4, Period6->8, Period11->13). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead-time history (reflecting the confirmed 2-period actual lead time). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest regime (last 5 weeks mean ~104.2/week); (1+L) coverage will be handled by backend. This balances service (capture recent higher demand) versus holding cost by avoiding long-tail averaging from much older low-demand weeks.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). SKU 554772002 (women's V-neck tee). Profit=$4, Holding=$1. On-hand=0, In-transit=325. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals 2 periods after order (Periods 2\u21924, 6\u21928, 11\u219213, 15\u219217), supporting lead time = 2. No sustained demand regime shift detected since earlier samples are limited and recent demand is volatile but not consistently higher for 3+ periods. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend applies L=2; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level (use historical mean across full sample set) versus holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Historical concluded lead times: observed 4 arrivals show lead_time=2 consistently (P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13, P15->P17) --> use calculated average. Recent demand has been elevated and variable (Periods 14-18 demands: 106,102,128,94,69), so forecast and volatility should use the last 5 samples to capture current regime. These parameters balance service (cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand) vs holding cost given large in-transit position.

On-hand=0, in-transit=331 \u2014 pipeline already covers multiple weeks (>> (1+L) demand). I choose promised/default lead time to keep alignment with observed behavior and avoid overreacting to earlier transient missing arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand and caps orders via the backend cap given the large in-transit quantity. This balances service (avoid stockouts) while limiting extra holding cost given high pipeline.

On-hand=0, in-transit=331 \u2014 pipeline is large and should cover multiple weeks of demand, but arrivals are observed only after conclusion, so treat lead time as empirically 2. I set L=calculate to let the backend use observed lead times (average\u22482). Demand and volatility will use default aggregations ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from full history; this balances service level given profit=$4 vs holding=$1 while respecting the confirmed lead time and large in-transit position.

To protect service with promised lead time 2, set L via calculate (confirmed by observed lead times) and base demand estimate on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current high-demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent variability. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by focusing on recent demand not the low historical winter samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=331. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 2 periods (multiple orders observed arriving with lead_time=2). Recent demand (Periods 13-22) averaged ~100.9/week vs early-sample mean ~68.6, indicating a sustained higher demand regime. I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (2). I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the recent higher-demand regime, avoiding dilution by older low-demand data; this matches available pipeline and reduces stockouts while controlling holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Observed concluded arrivals consistently imply a 2-period realized lead time; use 'calculate' to let backend confirm from concluded lead times. Use recent_N for demand parameters to focus on the post-change regime: N=11 (Periods 13\u201323) captures the sustained higher-demand regime. This keeps base_stock aligned to the higher mean while accounting for current pipeline, reducing stockouts without excessive holding given holding cost= $1 and profit=$4.

Demand regime shifted upward around Period 13 (sustained higher demand through Period 24). To capture the post-changepoint demand level I use recent_N over the regime length. Set L by calculating observed lead times (reflects confirmed lead_time=2). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (Periods 13\u201324, regime_length=12) so the backend base_stock reflects the higher mean and observed volatility; this biases toward higher service given profit/holding (profit=$4, hold=$1 -> q=0.8) while avoiding over-reliance on pre-shift low-demand samples.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=331 (covers several weeks). Historical concluded lead times consistently =2 when observed (arrivals in Periods 4,8,13,17), so set L method=calculate to let backend use observed average (\u22482). Demand increased from ~69 (early) to ~101 since Period 13 (carry-over insight). I use recent_N N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the post-change regime (Periods 13\u201325), so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the sustained higher demand; this balances service (capture higher mean) against holding cost while existing in-transit stock provides short-term cover.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=331. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=2 (multiple orders: P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13, P15->P17), so use measured lead time. Demand has shifted upward since ~Period 13; recent periods (P13\u2013P26) show a higher mean than the early sample window, so base stock should use recent demand to avoid understocking. I set L by calculation (average of observed lead times = 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 (periods 13\u201326) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; this balances service level against holding cost given profit $4 and holding $1 by using recent demand mean/variance rather than the older low-demand samples. In-transit inventory (331) will be counted by the backend\u2019s pipeline; these parameters ensure orders are sized to cover (1+L) review+lead demand under the current regime.

Concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=2 (Period4,8,13,17 arrivals all W=2); set L via 'calculate' to use average observed lead times=2. Demand regime shifted up around Period 13 (documented in carry-over); therefore forecast demand using the recent regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (captures Period13\u201327 data to reflect the higher mean and current volatility). These choices ensure the OR backend targets service for the sustained higher-demand regime while using observed lead-time behavior to avoid underordering against in-transit stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=331. Historical concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = promised 2 periods (evidence: multiple P\u2192P+2 arrivals). Demand has been in a higher regime since ~Period 13 (avg ~101); therefore I use recent demand stats to capture the new mean/volatility. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (backend expects L=2) while using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability. This balances higher service level (reduce stockouts given in-transit units and elevated demand) against holding cost by not over-extending beyond recent 10-period demand behavior.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since ~Period 13 (mean \u2248100.9) and multiple concluded arrivals indicating actual lead time = 2. On-hand=0, in-transit=331 which already covers ~3 periods of demand at the new regime. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (will reflect confirmed 2 periods). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (regime from Period13\u2192Period29 length=17) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent high-demand regime. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=17 to capture recent volatility. These settings align the base-stock target with the sustained higher demand while recognizing available pipeline (331 units) to avoid over-ordering and reduce holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has been in the higher regime identified earlier (sustained uplift since ~Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=331 (large pipeline). Promised L=2 has been repeatedly confirmed by concluded arrivals (observed lead_time=2 when arrivals occurred). I therefore use the promised lead time (default) for L. For demand I target the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the estimate on the post-changepoint periods\u2014I select N=18 (covers Periods 13\u201330, the detected higher-demand regime length) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 18 samples. This keeps orders aligned to the sustained higher demand while the large in-transit balance reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=331. Historical concluded lead times consistently 2 periods (e.g., P4,P8,P13,P17), so use promised/default lead time. Demand shows a sustained regime shift since ~Period 13 (higher mean ~101 vs ~69 earlier). I therefore forecast demand using recent samples from the post-change regime to capture the higher mean and volatility. Set L=default to keep lead-time = promised 2; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 13\u201331 sample count) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent regime. This balances higher service needs from increased demand while avoiding overstating demand from older low-demand periods; large in-transit (331) will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing order quantity.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=331 units (large pipeline). Historical concludes show actual lead time = 2 in prior confirmed events; use promised lead time. Current recent demand has fallen (last 5 periods: 107,70,47,30,26) so I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit stock. sigma_hat also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep L=promised, shrink forecast to recent demand, and prevent additional ordering while pipeline clears.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=331. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 2-period actual lead time for delivered orders; pipeline of 331 is large relative to recent weekly demand. Recent demand (Periods 28-33 = 107,70,47,30,26,46) has fallen vs the earlier high regime. I set L to default (promised lead time=2) because concluded evidence repeatedly supports LT=2 and some earlier gaps resolved. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the clear recent downward demand regime (weeks 28-33) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to size orders for the shorter, lower-demand recent regime while the large in-transit stock prevents aggressive reordering and reduces holding risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting ~Period 30: Periods 30-33 mean=37.25 vs prior regime (Periods 13-22 mean=100.9), sustained 4 weeks of much lower demand

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=331 which is ample coverage versus low recent demand. Historical concluded lead times have been 2 periods (evidence P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13, P15->P17); use promised/default lead time. To align the OR backend to the recent low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples) so the base stock and cap reflect the lower demand and reduce excess holding. This balances service vs holding given profit=$4, holding=$1.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent demand has been in the low regime since ~Period 30 (Period30-35 demands = 47,30,26,46,29,25; recent mean \u224833.8). Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 2-period actual lead time (multiple orders: P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13, P15\u2192P17). On-hand=0, in-transit=331 (ample pipeline). I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect the confirmed 2-period reality. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=6) covering the new low-demand regime so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean and volatility, which reduces target base stock and holding cost while preserving service given high profit/holding service ratio.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=331. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 2 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show W=2), so use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Demand has clearly shifted to a lower regime starting ~Period 30 (Periods 30-36 show low demand); use recent_N=7 to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent regime. Large in-transit pipeline means do not inflate forecasts; using recent samples reduces overstock risk while matching current demand. Methods chosen: L by calculate (observed lead_time=2), mu_hat recent_N=7 (captures periods 30-36), sigma_hat recent_N=7 (volatility from same window).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Product is a basic womens T-shirt; recent demand has been in the lower regime since ~Period 30 (weeks 30-37 showing consistently low weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=331 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 2 periods; no new evidence of loss. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (2) since concluded history matches it. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (periods 30-37) to capture the current low-demand regime when computing (1+L)*mean; sigma_hat also recent_N N=8 to reflect current volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned to the lower recent demand while the large in-transit pipeline will prevent immediate stockouts, balancing service and holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 30 (Periods 30-38 mean \u224829.8 units). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 2 periods, so I let backend compute average lead time (calculate). To align forecasts with the new low-demand regime and avoid excess holding on the large in-transit (331) volume, I use recent_N=9 (Periods 30-38) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base_stock and cap reflect the lower recent demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times consistently 2 periods in history. To avoid overstocking given large pipeline and sustained lower demand, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast using the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures Periods 30-39). This reduces target base-stock toward current low-demand reality and limits new receipts while the existing in-transit stock arrives.

Historical concluded lead times mostly confirm promised 2 periods. To avoid overstock given heavy pipeline and low current demand, keep L=default (promised=2) and forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (use recent_N=12). Use sigma_hat recent_N=12 to reflect recent low volatility. These settings steer the OR engine to a lower base stock and cap orders despite large in-transit inventory, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=331. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed at 2 periods repeatedly (e.g., Period2\u2192Period4, Period6\u2192Period8, Period11\u2192Period13, Period15\u2192Period17). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period30 (sustained low weekly demand through Period42). To reflect the recent low-demand regime, use recent_N demand estimates over the last 13 concluded periods (Periods 30-42). Keep L at the promised/default to match observed consistent 2-period behavior while letting the backend compute with promised lead time. This balances service (use recent lower mean to avoid overstock) against holding cost given large in-transit position.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been in the low regime since ~Period 30 (weeks 30-43 show consistently lower weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=331 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times repeatedly show 2 periods; use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Set demand forecast to recent regime: use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 30-43) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained lower demand and volatility; N=14 equals the detected regime length (capped rules satisfied). These parameters steer the OR engine to size base_stock for the current low-demand regime while accounting for the large in-transit pipeline and the observed lead time, reducing overstock risk given holding cost >0.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting ~Period 30 (weeks 30\u201344 much lower than earlier). Concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time \u22482 (several orders show lead_time=2). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=331 \u2014 pipeline is large and likely covers several periods. To reflect confirmed lead time I use 'calculate' (avg observed lead times \u22482). For demand I target the recent low-demand regime (Periods 30\u201344) using recent_N with N=15 so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower mean and volatility, avoiding over-ordering against past high-demand periods. This balances service (using true lead time) versus holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 30 (weekly demands mostly 47\u219214). On-hand=0 but in-transit=331 units \u2014 ample pipeline relative to current low demand, so avoid inflating forecasts. Promised lead time has historical confirmation of 2 but no new evidence to change it; keep default. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the detected low-demand regime (Periods 30\u201345, N=16) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability from the current low-demand regime and prevents excess ordering against the large in-transit inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=331. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=2 (multiple confirmed arrivals at W=2), so treat actual L=2. Pipeline (331) already covers multiple periods of forecast demand; avoid over-ordering. Demand regime shifted down around Period 30 and has stayed low since, so I use a recent-regime demand estimate: set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the last N=17 concluded demand samples (Periods 30\u201346) to capture the current low-demand regime. L chosen with method=calculate to reflect observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=17) to make the base-stock reflect the lower recent mean and volatility, lowering target inventory and reducing holding cost while preserving service given pipeline coverage.
