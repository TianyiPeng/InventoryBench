Profit per unit ($19) is high relative to holding cost ($1), so stocking a modest buffer is worthwhile despite holding cost. Action: place a conservative replenishment of 200 units to provide coverage for immediate high demand while limiting potential holding cost if the surge fades or delayed shipments eventually arrive. This overrides OR's 0 recommendation because of observed shipment delays and current demand spike; continue to monitor conclude messages to update lead-time belief and adjust future orders.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Increase OR's 0 to 200 units \u2014 recent huge demand spikes (342,210) and persistent delayed/lost shipments mean in-transit stock is unreliable; high profit justifies a modest buffer.",
