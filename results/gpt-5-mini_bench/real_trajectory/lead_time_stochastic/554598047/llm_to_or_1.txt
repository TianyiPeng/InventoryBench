Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward shift: samples = [0,0,9,23,26] (most recent three weeks 9,23,26). No concluded arrivals / in-transit = 0. I use promised lead time (default L=2) because no arrival evidence to override. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (last 3 samples average = 19.33 for a single period; backend will scale by 1+L). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=3 to reflect increased variability. These choices prioritize service for the detected demand uptick while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the OR engine's z* tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: last 3 samples (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) avg=19.33 vs earlier weeks avg=0.0 (Jan 7-14); sustained increase over 3 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (samples: 9, 23, 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=35 and Period1 order (35) has not arrived (arrived=0) \u2014 possible delay but no confirmed lead-time change yet. Choose L=default to use promised 2-period lead time (no concluded arrivals to compute actual lead time). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 3 samples: 9,23,26) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 3). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect volatility in the new regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat to cover increased demand) against holding cost given profit=holding, while preserving caution about the delayed shipment by not yet changing lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand regime (2019-01-21..2019-02-04) showed sustained increase; on-hand=0, in-transit=98 (35+63 ordered prior periods) with no concluded arrivals yet. No concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time, so keep L at promised (default=2). Use mu_hat default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (samples mean=11.6 \u2192 demand across review+lead \u224834.8). Use sigma_hat default so backend computes volatility from all samples. This balances service (capturing the recent higher mean via full-sample mean) while avoiding overreacting to limited history; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent demand regime shift detected (samples 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04, avg \u224819.33 over 3 weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=98; prior orders (Periods 1-2) have not concluded\u2014possible delays but insufficient periods to confirm lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default L=2) because actual lead time not yet reliably observed. Set demand forecast using recent_N=3 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (uses last 3 samples). Use sigma recent_N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices let the OR backend raise base stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new higher mean while using recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-4 concl): 54,90,55,29 \u2014 a sustained higher regime vs earlier seed data. On-hand=34 + in-transit=136 (total pipeline 170) provides substantial coverage but in-transit may include older orders; avoid further understock by forecasting using the recent high-demand regime. Confirmed arrival pattern supports promised lead time. Set L=default to use promised 2-period lead time; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the most recent 4 demand observations ((1+L)\xd7mean of {54,90,55,29}); set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service level (use recent high mean) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has risen and stabilized since 2019-01-21 (carry-over insight). On-hand=0, in-transit=137 (pipeline substantial). Use observed lead-time history to set L by calculation. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (periods with demands 54,90,55,29,54); mu_hat and sigma_hat based on those 5 most recent samples across the review+lead horizon (1+L periods) to balance service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=169. Recent realized weekly demand has been elevated (Periods1-6 demands: 54,90,55,29,54,64) indicating a higher regime than the Jan samples. Lead time observations: two concluded arrivals give lead_times [2,1] (no sustained single LT yet). I choose L recent_N to weight recent observed lead times (N=2) to reflect short-term variability; mu_hat recent_N and sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to base forecast and volatility on the last 6 observed weekly demands (captures current elevated regime). These parameters ensure the backend builds base-stock for the review+lead horizon using recent demand while acknowledging lead-time variation in the short run.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=173. Observed lead times in concluded history: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) \u2014 mixed, so use calculated average. Recent demand is volatile; use last 3 periods (P5-P7) to capture current regime. These choices balance service (use recent demand) and holding cost (average lead time reduces overstock risk given large in-transit).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand regime confirmed (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) with higher mean; recent observed lead times = [2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=136 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrival timing uncertain due to mixed 1\u20132 period observations. I set L to recent_N (N=4) to reflect observed average lead time ~1.5 (captures variability vs promised=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to anchor forecast on the sustained higher regime (last 3 samples: 9,23,26). Sigma estimated from same recent regime (recent_N N=3) to reflect increased volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while letting the backend cap limit inventory given the substantial in-transit volume.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=182. Recent realized demand has risen and been volatile (last 5 period demands: 54,64,26,92,102; mean\u224867.6) vs earlier low-demand regime. Observed lead times: 2,1,2,1 => use calculated average lead time. Set L to calculate to reflect observed lead-time history. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the newly higher, volatile demand regime and to ensure pipeline covers (1+L) review+lead demand. This also hedges against missing/lost shipments by increasing forecasted pipeline needs based on recent realized demand rather than old low-demand samples.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has been high and volatile (last 5 demands: 64,26,92,102,138) after earlier regime shift in Jan. Observed lead times are mixed (1 and 2) so I use the calculated average to let the backend infer typical L. To capture the recent higher demand level I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base stock reflects the last 5-week regime and balances service vs holding given profit=holding. On-hand=0 and in-transit=157 provide coverage but lost/delayed shipments occurred historically; using recent demand and calculated L helps adjust orders accordingly.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=254 (large pipeline from prior orders). Observed lead times fluctuate between 1\u20132 periods (multiple concluded arrivals); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has shifted up since 2019-01-21 and recent weeks are higher and more variable; use recent_N on the last 6 demand samples (Periods 6\u201311) to capture the current regime for both mean and volatility. These choices balance service (capture higher recent demand) while recognizing variable lead time and large pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent demand has been high and volatile (recent demands: 92,102,138,112,127). On-hand=0, in-transit=267 (large pipeline). Observed lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); average observed lead time is best estimate. I choose L='calculate' to let backend use observed lead times average. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent high-demand regime (last 5 demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects current elevated demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate needed orders. These settings balance service (reflect recent high demand) against holding cost (pipeline already large).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Current on-hand=1, in-transit=246; recent demand has been consistently high (multiple weeks 92\u2013138). Observed lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods; average observed LT is ~1.5. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding both $1), I let backend compute L from observed lead times (method=calculate). For demand I use a recent-window estimate to react to the sustained high-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 (captures last 6 demand weeks, stable high mean). For volatility I also use recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent variability. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders using its cap formula and computed average lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=320. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times but skew toward 2 periods (recent observed lead times: P10=1, P13=2, P14=2 \u2192 avg\u22481.67), so I use recent_N=3 to capture the most recent lead-time behavior. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10-14 = 138,112,127,96,82) average \u2248111. I set mu_hat to recent_N=5 to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on this recent high-demand regime. Volatility has also increased, so sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent std. These choices make the OR backend target a base stock aligned with the current high-demand regime while using a recent lead-time estimate to avoid under/over-ordering given variable arrivals; they balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding, favoring moderate safety stock informed by recent demand and lead-time evidence.

I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the observed-average lead time (captures mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals). With substantial in-transit stock, use default demand and volatility estimates so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale with (1+L) and historical samples; this avoids overfitting to recent noise while the pipeline is large. These settings balance service (use observed lead time) vs holding cost (defaults keep estimates conservative).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times vary (1s and 2s); I use 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 outcomes). For demand I use 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect the sustained higher regime and leverage all history; sigma_hat='default' to scale historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (high recent demand) vs holding cost given sizable in-transit stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand is now consistently high (many weeks 82\u2013138) vs early Jan low period; on-hand=0, in-transit=320 (large pipeline). Observed lead times in concluded history cluster at 2 periods (several P\u2192P+2 arrivals), so use calculated average lead time rather than promised blind default. For demand I use a recent-window estimate to capture the post-Jan high-demand regime; choose N=8 (covers the most recent 8 concluded demand samples, balancing recency and sample size). Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to current high-demand regime while accounting for observed lead-time behavior and the large in-transit inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=0, In-transit=320. Recent demand has risen: Periods 16-18 demands = 96,113,160 (sharp uptick). There are multiple in-transit units that will arrive per promised lead time; no clear evidence of lost shipments beyond historical occasional 1-period early arrivals. I set L=default to trust the promised 2-period lead time (supported by prior confirmations). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (last 3 periods). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend inflate base stock for the new higher-demand regime while using recent variability to balance service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16: avg Periods 16-18 = 123 vs prior Periods 13-15 = 87.7 (+40%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical concluded lead times recent sequence = [2,2,2] (last 3 observed), so I use recent_N for L to reflect currently consistent 2-period deliveries. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 16; recent 3-week demand avg = 128 units -> use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the new regime and recent volatility. These settings (L recent_N N=3; mu_hat recent_N N=3; sigma_hat recent_N N=3) align orders to cover (1+L) periods of the confirmed higher demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand weeks; large in-transit (369) will be accounted for by OR backend pipeline subtraction.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=384 which likely covers multiple weeks of current elevated demand. Observed lead times in concluded history are mostly 2 with occasional 1s; using a recent-average to capture recent variability. Demand shows a sustained higher regime starting Period 16 (Periods 16-20 demand: 96,113,160,111,109); I use a recent_N forecast to anchor to this regime. Choices: L recent_N N=5 to reflect recent observed lead-time mix; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demand samples (captures post-Period16 uplift); sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to estimate volatility from the same recent window.

For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 16-21) while smoothing earlier noise; same recent window for sigma to reflect current volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand elevated: last 6 demands (Periods 19-24) = [111,109,82,59,101,152], mean \u2248102.3 \u2014 aligns with previously recorded regime shift starting Period 16. In-transit = 369 (large pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period leads; promised lead time = 2. To bias orders toward recent higher demand while respecting pipeline, set lead time to default (promised=2), use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current higher-demand regime. This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent mean and variance while the backend caps orders using its cap rule to avoid overshoot given the large in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Recent demand remains elevated vs early history: last 5 weeks (Periods 21-25) demands = [82,59,101,152,93], mean\u224897.4 and volatile. Promised lead time=2 has been repeatedly observed historically; no new sustained lead-time change. To reflect the recent higher demand regime while keeping the backend's lead-time assumption, I set L=default (use promised 2), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (capture current higher demand) vs holding cost by adapting forecast to recent weeks rather than long-ago low-demand weeks.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Recent demand (Periods 23-26) = [101,152,93,98], average \u2248111 \u2014 sustained over 4 weeks and above earlier baseline, so use a short recent-window forecast to capture current level. No clear new lead-time evidence (historical concluded arrivals still centered on 2), so keep promised lead time. Choose recent_N for demand and volatility using last 4 samples to reflect current demand regime and limit overweighting older low-demand history. This balances service (meet ~4-week demand) vs holding cost given large in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=369 units which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of recent demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time \u22482; use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 23-27 = 101,152,93,98,51; mean\u224899) appears lower than mid-summer peaks but is the best short-run predictor. To reflect current demand regime and recent variability, use recent_N (last 5 weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders toward current demand while the large in-transit pipeline provides buffer against arrival uncertainty.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weekly demand (Periods 26-28) = [98,51,63], recent mean ~70.7, previous periods volatile but no new sustained regime >=3 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=369 \u2014 ample pipeline cover vs (1+L) periods. Use promised lead time (default) to keep alignment with supplier; use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the most recent regime while avoiding outdated early-year lows. This keeps base_stock responsive to current demand and leverages large in-transit inventory to avoid overordering given high holding cost (holding=profit).

Historical concludes show confirmed lead time=2 (recorded earlier) and multiple demand regime shifts in early periods; recent demand (Periods 23-29) averages ~88 with volatile weekly demand. No clear new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time in the last 3+ periods. To let the OR engine use its full-sample estimates while respecting the promised lead time, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples with L=promised.

LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=369 units \u2014 sizeable pipeline that likely covers upcoming demand given typical weekly demand history. Historic concluded lead times show mostly 2-period arrivals (carry-over noted). Recent weekly demands (Periods 28-30 = 63, 68, 40) show no new sustained regime shift. I therefore keep lead time at the promised/default, and use default demand mean/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples). This avoids over-ordering while in-transit inventory is already high.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=369 (large pipeline). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time ~2 and earlier demand regime shifts (noted). Recent demand has moderated vs mid-summer spikes; to reflect recent demand while letting the OR backend account for promised lead time and historical variance, I use default L (promised 2), set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to focus the forecast on the last 10 weeks, and use default sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled for (1+L). This keeps orders responsive to current demand while the large in-transit stock reduces immediate order needs and guards against over-ordering if shipments are lost.

To avoid overstock while keeping service, keep L at promised (default) and use recent 3-week demand to set mu_hat/sigma_hat (capture current lower regime).

On-hand=0, in-transit=369 (large pipeline) so risk of overstock if backend uses long-horizon mean. I keep L as promised (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the lowered regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std, reducing orders relative to long-run averages and balancing service vs holding cost given heavy in-transit inventory.

Promised lead time remains 2 and historical concluded lead-times are mixed but previously confirmed as 2; no strong sustained shift in lead time to record. To keep the policy responsive to the recent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures most recent mean/volatility). Using recent short-window avoids overstocking against earlier summer peaks while acknowledging large in-transit volume may cover upcoming demand or indicate lost shipments \u2014 we do not assume lost shipments here. These parameters bias orders toward lower replenishment given current low observed demand and high pipeline.

Forecast demand using the most recent short regime (last 3 weeks) to reflect the present low-demand state: set mu_hat recent_N with N=3. Volatility should match recent variability, so set sigma_hat recent_N with N=3. These choices reduce ordering driven by older high-demand periods and let the OR backend cap orders using its cap formula to avoid excess inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=369 (many undelivered units visible in pipeline). Historical demand has fallen to a lower recent regime (roughly Periods 30-37: 40,32,28,46,22,23,21,34). Promised lead time was 2 and prior evidence confirmed lead time=2 earlier; use default promised L to keep OR engine alignment. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent low-demand regime (8 most recent samples) so base-stock targets avoid overstocking given holding cost equals profit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but predominantly 2; observed lead times = [2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,2], avg \u22481.67. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture this empirical average. Demand shows earlier sustained regime shifts captured in carry-over; no new sustained demand change in recent periods, so use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (using empirical lead time) against holding cost given large pipeline stock (369 units) and equal profit/holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods with intermittent 1-period arrivals; use aggregate observed lead time (calculate) to let backend average evidence. Demand has trended down since mid-year; to be responsive to recent lower demand I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on last 7 concluded demand points to capture current regime while keeping sample >=3. This balances service (use recent demand) vs holding cost given zero on-hand and sizable in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=369 (large pipeline). Recent weekly demand has been low (Periods 38-40: 18,19,10). No new sustained demand or lead-time shifts since prior carry-over insights. To avoid overstock given heavy in-transit, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent 3 weeks: (1+L)=3 multiplies the recent mean. Use recent_N=3 for sigma to capture current low-volatility regime. This keeps OR backend target inventory modest while accounting for current low demand and large pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25): recent weekly demand has settled low (Periods 29-41 avg ~34\u2192 recent window shows lower variability). No new sustained lead-time signals (historical confirms LT=2 earlier). I use promised lead time (default=2). For demand I focus on the most recent regime (Periods 29-41, 13 samples) to reflect the lowered mean/volatility\u2014so use recent_N with N=13 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the recent regime. This balances avoiding excess holdings while maintaining service for current lower demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical concluded lead times repeatedly show 2-period arrivals (carry-over confirms LT=2); no new sustained LT change. Recent demand has settled to low weekly values \u2014 last 6 concluded demands (Periods 37-42) = [34,18,19,10,14,25], avg=20. I use promised/default L to keep alignment with confirmed pattern, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the recent low-demand regime and recent variability so the backend computes (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most relevant samples. This balances service (cover near-term demand) against holding cost given high in-transit stock.

Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Recent demand has been low (last 5 weeks: 19,10,14,25,10; mean=15.6). Previous carry-over confirms lead time = 2. I set L=default (promised 2). To capture the current lower-demand regime I use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 5 samples. Large in-transit (369) already covers multiple review+lead periods, so this conservative forecast avoids placing excessive new orders while preserving service level.

Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=369 (large pipeline). Recent demand has fallen to ~17 units/week over the last 8 weeks (Periods 37-44). No new sustained lead-time change (previously confirmed L=2). To reflect the recent low-demand regime while keeping the OR engine aware of current variability, set L to default (promised 2), use recent_N for demand forecast on the last 8 samples (captures current low season), and recent_N for volatility with N=8. Large in-transit stock means orders will be modest under the backend cap; this configuration balances service vs holding cost by basing forecast on the newest regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=369. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 in prior evidence; promised lead time is 2. Recent demand (Periods 43-45 = 10,7,13) is low and stable compared with earlier spikes, so I use a short recent window to capture current low-rate regime. I set L to default (promised 2) to let OR use contractual lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (last 3 demand samples) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on current low-demand weeks; this reduces overstock risk given high in-transit inventory and equal profit/holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=369 which substantially exceeds expected demand over review+lead period. Recent weekly demand (Periods 41-46) is low: [14,25,10,7,13,15], mean=14.0. To avoid further excess holding given profit=holding ($1 each) I keep promised lead time and use a recent_N demand estimate (N=6) to reflect the current low December regime; sigma uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. This will drive the OR engine to produce near-zero orders because pipeline >> mu_hat.
