Evaluation: OR's cap (108) is well below the expected 3-period demand (\u2248163) and recent two weeks show high demand (85,85) suggesting an upward shift; also calendar proximity to Valentine\u2019s Day (Feb 14) may raise underwear demand slightly. Risk tradeoff: profit per unit $4 exceeds holding $1, so higher critical fractile justifies safety stock.

Demand outlook: historical sample mean ~54/wk but realized recent weekly demand is much higher (~90\u2013130 range), so single-period demand has increased versus the old samples. OR recommends 0 units. Decision logic: with 642 units already in the pipeline, even if some shipments are lost, suficientes units are outstanding to cover multiple upcoming periods of elevated demand (642 >> recent single-period demand ~100). Ordering now would only increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) while profit per unit is $4 \u2014 but given large pipeline, additional orders are unnecessary and risky if lead time uncertainty persists. Lead-time inference: there is some evidence of shorter lead time (1 period) for recent orders, but the signal is limited and mixed due to earlier delayed/lost shipments, so I will not rely on it to place new orders.
