Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals observed. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u2248 63.0 and moderate spread; no sustained changepoint evidence. Promised lead time is 2 periods and with no contrary arrival history I use default lead time. To let the OR engine compute base-stock from long-run sample stats I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters conservative given zero starting inventory while avoiding overfitting to a very short recent window.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand mean = 63 (samples: 85,71,74,49,36). The P1 conclude shows ordered=96 arrived=0 \u2014 this is expected given promised lead time=2 (orders placed in P1 will arrive in P3 arrival resolution and be visible in P3 conclude). On-hand=0, in-transit=96. Using default lead time and default demand estimates (no sustained changepoint or lead-time evidence yet). Defaults yield (1+L)\xd7mean to cover review+lead period and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given available history.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=188. No concluded arrivals yet for prior orders (Period 1 and 2 conclude show arrived=0), but promised lead time is 2 and we have not yet observed arrival confirmations for orders placed in Period 1 (which would conclude this period). No sustained lead-time change or demand regime shift detected from available data (historical weekly mean=63 over five samples). Use promised lead time and historical-demand defaults to let the OR backend compute base-stock and caps while covering (1+L) periods of demand. This balances service level (cover ~3 periods of mean demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples mean=63 (samples:85,71,74,49,36). Promised L=2 but orders placed in Periods 1-3 (96+92+97=285 in-transit) have not concluded by Period 3 conclude \u2192 sustained missing/delayed arrivals across 3 periods. I set L explicit=3 to reflect longer actual lead time (missing shipments suggest >2). Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, yielding a multi-period demand forecast scaled to the chosen lead time and preserving estimated variability for safety stock. This balances raising order coverage for delayed arrivals while avoiding over-explicit forecasting assumptions.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders placed P1-P3 totalling 285 units have not arrived by Period 3 conclude; indicates actual lead time >2 (treat as 3 until proven otherwise).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1288.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent on-hand=23, in-transit=277; recent demand (Periods1-4) shows weeklies: 43,118,84,69 and historical Jan samples 85,71,74,49,36. Multiple early-period orders were delayed; cautious operational assumption is lead time = 3 to cover potential further delays. Set L explicit=3 to reflect suspected extended lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks) capturing the current regime while avoiding overweighting older months. Keep sigma_hat default so backend computes volatility from full sample set scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (higher base stock for longer LT and recent demand) against holding cost conservatively given delayed shipments and current pipeline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand (Periods 1-5) = [43,118,84,69,47], mean=72.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=340 (covers multiple future periods). Several earlier shipments (P1,P3) remain missing\u2014practical experience suggests effective lead time longer than promised; to avoid stockouts I set lead time to 3. I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to reflect the most recent realized demand regime. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service level given delayed/lost shipments while sigma recent_N captures recent variability for safety stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25. Observed concluded lead times are mixed (one order showed 2, one showed 1); earlier missing shipments indicate variability but not a sustained new lead-time regime. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times. Recent realized weekly demand (P1\u2013P6 = 43,118,84,69,47,49) averages ~68.33; using (1+avg L) multiplier yields target across review+lead \u2248171 units, so I set mu_hat explicit=171 to give the OR engine a concrete forecast that covers (L+1) periods of demand. I keep sigma_hat as default so backend computes volatility from full sample history. This balances service (higher mu_hat to cover demand variability and delayed shipments) against holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent realized demand (Periods 3-7) shows weekly sales: 84,69,47,49,59 (mean ~61.6). There are outstanding in-transit units=327 and on-hand=0; earlier missing shipments (orders P1-P3) indicate actual lead time > promised 2 and have been treated as 3. To be conservative versus lost/delayed shipments I set lead time explicitly to 3. I use a recent_N=5 demand estimate (covers the most recent regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent to capture the 4-period coverage; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock sized to cover 4 periods of current demand while acknowledging delayed arrivals and limiting excess holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P5\u2192P6), 2 (P6\u2192P8)] and demand history has high recent weekly demand (samples: 85,71,74,49,36; plus recent realized demands in concludes up to 121). On-hand=0 and in-transit=277 \u2014 pipeline is large but some earlier orders were delayed; use inferred average lead time from concluded arrivals to let backend adjust base stock. Set L by calculate (average observed lead times) so backend captures variable actual lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level versus holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Updated lead time inference: observed lead_times = [2,1,2], average \u2248 1.67 periods (evidence: P2\u2192P4, P5\u2192P6, P6\u2192P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): recent demand has been high and volatile (period demands last 9 periods: 43,118,84,69,47,49,59,121,110). On-hand=0, in-transit=286 (large pipeline from earlier orders). Observed concluded lead times = [2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P5\u2192P6), 2 (P6\u2192P8)] \u2014 short-term average \u22481.67. To capture the recent lead-time behaviour use recent_N (N=3). Demand regime appears elevated versus the older baseline and consistent over the last 9 periods, so forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=9 to reflect current mean and variability. These settings give the OR engine an (1+L)-period demand estimate based on the most relevant data and a matching sigma to set safety stock; using recent data mitigates overstating demand from older low periods while the L choice accounts for the slightly below-promised observable lead-time average and helps avoid excess orders while pipeline (286) is still large.

Demand recent sequence (Periods 6-10): [49,59,121,110,73] shows elevated and volatile demand; use recent 5 samples to capture current regime. I set L to recent_N N=3 to reflect the empirical average lead time from the last 3 observed lead-times. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and captures recent mean/volatility. This balances service (cover higher recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit volume (315 units) and moderate holding cost ($1).

LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Recent concluded lead-time observations = [2,1,2,1] (orders P2\u2192P4, P5\u2192P6, P6\u2192P8, P9\u2192P10) indicating actual lead time \u22481.5 periods (not the promised 2).

I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all demand samples, letting the backend incorporate the chosen L into the (review+lead) demand estimate. This balances service (shorter inferred L reduces required pipeline cover) against holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Recent demand (Periods 8-12) is elevated: [121,110,73,76,130] \u2192 recent mean \u2248102 units/week. Lead times observed vary (1\u20132); prior inference averaged \u22481.67. Use calculated average lead time to let backend infer current realized average from concluded arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (last 5 periods) so the base-stock reflects current demand spike while sigma from same window captures recent volatility. This balances service (avoid large stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by not overreacting to very old low-demand samples.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent concluded lead times (P2\u2192P4=2, P5\u2192P6=1, P6\u2192P8=2, P9\u2192P10=1, P11\u2192P13=2) average ~1.6; I use a recent average to reflect this shorter-than-promised mean. Demand recent regime higher than the Jan samples: last 5 realized demands = [110,73,76,130,44], indicating a sustained uplift vs. historical mean (regime length=5). On-hand=0 but in-transit=358 (large pipeline) so orders should target expected demand over review+lead using recent demand estimates while avoiding excessive additional pipeline. Therefore: set L as recent_N to capture observed ~1.6 lead; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the base-stock on the current high-demand regime and to reflect recent variability. These choices help the OR engine balance service level (by using recent higher mean) against holding cost (avoiding overreaction since substantial pipeline exists).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2] (avg \u22481.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 \u2014 significant pipeline exists but prior missing shipments resolved. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of all observed lead times (captures the ~1.6 signal). Demand has clearly shifted up since the Jan samples; I use recent_N for demand and volatility to focus the forecast on the post-change regime (last 11 demand periods since the regime change around Period 4). Using recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the recent high-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent demand is elevated and volatile since Period 9 (many weeks of 70+ and several 100+ spikes). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2] (avg\u22481.6); use recent average to reflect shorter-than-promised shipments but not zero. Set L by recent_N (N=3) averaging the last 3 observed lead times to capture most recent behaviour. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=6 (Periods 10-15 demands = 73,76,130,44,55,43; captures the current higher-demand regime) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean_recent. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to capture current volatility. These choices balance service (cover elevated recent demand over review+lead period) while avoiding overstating demand using all-history mean; large in-transit stock will temper ordering via pipeline subtraction in OR engine.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3. Recent demand has been volatile with a large spike (Period16 demand=203). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 units (sizable pipeline). Observed concluded lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2] (Periods P4,P6,P8,P10,P13), average 1.6 \u2192 use recent_N over last 5 observed lead times. Demand recent window (last 5 weekly samples: 130,44,55,43,203) mean=95; use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture the recent regime including the spike. Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect increased recent volatility. These choices (L recent_N=5, mu_hat recent_N=5, sigma_hat recent_N=5) align pipeline expectations with observed lead-time behavior and emphasize recent high demand to reduce stockouts while the large in-transit quantity limits over-ordering.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=486 \u2014 large pipeline covering multiple periods; last order (P17 ordered=128) has not concluded. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses averaged observed lead times (captures the ~1.6 observed). For demand params I choose defaults: mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; with large in-transit inventory this conservative approach avoids aggressive new orders while letting the OR engine set the appropriate base stock given observed lead time. No new explicit adjustments despite some delayed arrivals \u2014 keep defaults until a sustained regime change is confirmed.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=486. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed lead_times include multiple 2s and 1s; recent average \u22481.67) and earlier long delays resolved; treat lead time as the average of observed concluded lead times so the OR backend adapts to mixed 1\u20132 period realizations. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the backend applies its base-stock and cap logic consistently given the inferred L. This balances service (captures longer effective lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=486 (covers multiple future periods). Recent observed lead times show shorter-than-promised arrivals; recent demand has increased (periods 15-19: 43,203,222,157,178). I set L via recent_N to capture the recent realized lead-time average (more responsive than promised=2). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (most recent 5 samples). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend compute base-stock and cap using recent realized lead time and the elevated recent demand, balancing service vs holding cost given large in-transit position.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed ~1.6 periods (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2], average = 1.6) with evidence from concluded arrivals P4,P6,P8,P10,P13.

Demand has clearly shifted up starting Period 16 (recent demands: P16-P20 = 203,222,157,178,230); I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect this new high-demand regime (captures (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 5 samples) so orders target current elevated demand while the backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Pipeline is large (in-transit=682) but on-hand=0; several past shipments confirm variable lead times averaging ~1.6. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend use all observed lead-time evidence. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (last 5 periods). For sigma I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the elevated demand (reduce stockouts) while backend caps orders to limit excess exposure given large in-transit inventory.

======================================================================

Lead-time evidence from concluded arrivals (P4,P6,P8,P10,P13,P22) supports a shorter-than-promised average (~1.6); use backend's calculate to capture observed lead-time data. To capture the recent demand regime I use recent_N=7 (the 7 most recent weeks of elevated demand) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the higher current demand while limiting excess inventory since substantial pipeline already exists.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile since mid-April\u2013June (many >100/week, spike weeks: P16=203, P17=222, P19=178, P20=230). On-hand=0, in-transit=562 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times average ~1.6 (evidence in concludes P4,P6,P8,P10,P13,P22). I set L='calculate' so backend uses observed average lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime, mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12 (last 12 demand periods) so the forecast and volatility reflect the sustained surge; this balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given the existing large in-transit position.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has been substantially higher and more volatile since ~Period 12 (many weeks of 100+ demand including spikes 203,222,230). On-hand=0, in-transit=595 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods with multi-period evidence\u2014use overall observed average. Set L by 'calculate' to let backend use all observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (regime from ~Period 12 to present, length ~13); choose N=13 so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect this elevated mean and volatility and produce a base-stock that balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1), avoiding understock during the new high-demand regime while capping orders via backend cap.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand 0, in-transit 595. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead_times of 1 and 2 (recent pattern stable). Recent demand has been high and volatile; last 5 period demands = [151, 93, 107, 133, 123] (mean ~121.4). I set L to recent_N to reflect the short 1\u20132 period empirical lead times (use last 5 observations). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures current high-demand regime and limits influence of much older low-demand data). These parameters balance service (using recent higher mean) vs holding cost by relying on recent evidence rather than long-run averages.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 (large pipeline). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sequence from history = [2,1,2,1,2,2,3], avg \u22481.857). I select L method='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (reflects recent variability including a 3-period delay). For demand I use mu_hat method='default' and sigma_hat method='default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively \u2014 this leverages full historical demand while letting L adjust the review+lead horizon. This balances service (using the inferred longer lead time) against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Carry-over insight: Lead time updated to \u22481.857 periods (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,2,3], average = 13/7 \u22481.857) based on concluded arrivals through Period 26.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead_times show variability (observed sequence includes 1,2,3 with recent average \u22481.857) so I let the backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded data. Use default demand estimates so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost given large pipeline and uncertain recent lead-time noise.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=519. Historical concluded lead-times show variability with recent average \u22481.857 (see prior carry-overs); shipments have been delayed up to 3 periods. I set L explicit to 1.857 to reflect the confirmed multi-period lead-time regime and to avoid under-ordering. Demand has clearly increased in recent weeks (Periods 24-28 demands = 133,123,88,130,65); to capture this regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This balances service (higher target stock given long/variable lead time and recent higher demand) against holding cost by using a short recent window rather than all historic low-season samples. Pipeline (519) is large\u2014using recent demand and explicit L prevents overreacting to in-transit while ensuring safety stock for lead-time variability.

To reflect recent actual lead-time behavior and recent demand dynamics, set L using recent_N over the last 7 observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 7 demand samples to capture the current demand regime and volatility. This keeps pipeline cover aligned to observed lead-time ~1.86 and uses recent demand for (1+L)-period forecast, balancing service with holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Demand history is noisy with intermittent spikes; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) so OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std consistently. Large in-transit stock reduces urgency to inflate orders; using calculate for L lets backend balance service vs holding given observed lead-time evidence.

I set L to recent_N over the 7 most-recent observed lead_times to reflect the confirmed ~1.857-period lead time and to guard vs. occasional 3-period delays. Demand has shifted higher starting ~P17; I use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-change regime (covers recent 15 demand observations) so base-stock reflects current elevated demand while sigma captures recent volatility. With 519 units in-transit (covers multiple review+lead periods), this reduces immediate stockout risk; the chosen parameters keep service high but avoid excess holding given $1 holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 26\u201332 = 88,130,65,60,59,58,66) indicates a new, lower but variable regime vs early-year spikes.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,2,3,3] (avg=2.0), indicating actual lead time \u22482 periods (use calculate to reflect observed average). Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this leverages the provided demand seed while letting OR engine scale for the inferred L. This approach accounts for the large in-transit inventory and confirmed lead-time evidence while avoiding overreacting to recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2.0 periods (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,2,3,3], average = 2.0) based on concluded arrivals through Period 35.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=519. Historical concluded lead times through Period 36 support a confirmed actual lead time \u22482.0 periods. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=2.0). With a large pipeline already (519) and low holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit), use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this defers demand estimation to the backend while respecting the observed lead time and avoiding excess new orders given the substantial in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=0, in-transit=519. Historical concluded lead-times recently stabilized around 2.0 (Periods through 35). Demand has been elevated and volatile in recent weeks (recent demands: P31-37 include 58,66,113,44,36,56,116). Given large in-transit volume and evidence lead time \u22482, set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses confirmed data. Use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (N=7) to capture the current high-demand regime while avoiding overreacting to single spikes. Keep sigma_hat as default (uses all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to give the OR engine a conservative uncertainty estimate. These choices prioritize service (high profit vs low holding cost) but respect the large in-transit pipeline to limit extra orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 \u2014 substantial pipeline present but arrivals are observed with variable lead times historically; most recent sustained evidence (through Period 35) confirmed actual lead time \u22482.0. I choose to let the OR engine compute an empirical lead time from observed concluded arrivals (method: calculate). Demand estimates use the full-sample defaults so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this balances service level against holding cost given a confirmed ~2-period lead time and large existing pipeline.

LLM Rationale:

Pipeline (519) is large vs recent weekly demands, so risk is holding cost rather than stockouts. I will use the promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its full-sample mean/variance forecast and the capped ordering cap to avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline.

Historical concluded lead-time evidence through Period 36 confirms actual lead time \u22482.0 periods. Demand history (weekly samples provided) shows variable weekly demand; given large in-transit and confirmed LT=2, use the backend defaults so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This avoids overreacting to short recent spikes while letting the OR engine cap orders with its cap calculation against pipeline inventory, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) and holding cost exposure from the sizable in-transit stock.

Use promised/default lead time so OR backend applies its calibrated statistics across all samples; use default demand and volatility estimates to let the engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std.

Promised lead time=2; recent evidence confirms actual \u22482.0. I select L by 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the confirmed 2.0).

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=519 \u2014 large pipeline. Historical concluded lead-times through Period 35 average ~2.0. Recent demand (Periods 40-44) is low (29,23,88,43,56 earlier) but longer history shows higher weekly variability. To align the OR engine with observed actual lead time and use full-sample demand statistics, I set L to the calculated average lead time and leave mu_hat and sigma_hat to backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the base-stock policy uses the full historical demand distribution while accounting for confirmed ~2-period lead time. This leverages the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering while keeping service-level driven safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, In-transit=519. Historical concluded arrivals through Period 35 support an average actual lead time \u22482.0 periods. Pipeline (519) provides coverage vs upcoming demand but arrival visibility is delayed by conclude messaging. I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses observed lead times (matches confirmed ~2.0). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use entire sample history) to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; with profit=19 and holding=1 (high critical fractile \u22480.95) this yields a high base-stock to prioritize service while keeping holding cost input to the optimizer.

Historical concluded lead-times through Period 36 averaged 2.0; no new concluded arrivals since then to justify changing that estimate despite large in-transit quantity. Demand history is noisy with no recent sustained regime shift. I therefore let the OR backend use the average observed lead time (calculate) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the engine applies (1+L) scaling consistently; this is conservative given missing recent concludes and avoids overreacting to in-transit volume that may be delayed or lost.
