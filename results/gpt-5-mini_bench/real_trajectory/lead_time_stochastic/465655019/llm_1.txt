On-hand=3, in-transit=725 but history shows many delayed/lost shipments and highly variable lead times (observed LT=1\u20133 and many missing arrivals). Holding cost = $1/unit/period equals profit, so excess inventory is costly. Promised lead time=2, so we should cover (L+1)=3 weeks of demand ~216 units, but given large unreliable in-transit volume I will place a modest replenishment to reduce stockout risk while limiting holding exposure. Order 200 units (balances service vs. high holding cost and shipment uncertainty).",
