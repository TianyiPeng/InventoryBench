Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward shift across the last three samples (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04: 125,150,153). On-hand and in-transit are zero so we must cover current period plus lead. Use L=default (promised 2) since no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 weeks). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to prioritize service through the apparent demand spike while sigma based on recent variability keeps safety stock responsive and avoids excessive long-term holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04: avg increased from 12 (2019-01-07\u20132019-01-14) to 142 (2019-01-21\u20132019-02-04) (~+1080%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent history shows a clear demand regime shift (Period 3\u20137 in data) with much higher weekly demand; an order of 168 placed in Period 1 has not yet concluded (expected later), on-hand=0, in-transit=168. No concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time not yet confirmed\u2014use promised lead time. Use default demand estimates based on all samples (captures the identified regime shift while remaining robust given limited history). Default sigma to let OR backend scale safety stock by observed variability.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=368 (orders from P1+P2). Promised lead time is 2 and we have no concluded arrivals yet, so do not change L. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime from 2019-01-21 onward (recent weekly samples: 125,150,153). I use recent_N=3 for demand to capture the higher recent mean (\u2248142.7) and short-run volatility, and recent_N=3 for sigma to reflect recent variability. These parameters (L=default, mu_hat recent_N=3, sigma_hat recent_N=3) raise the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window while keeping holding cost pressure in mind.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=441 (orders P1=168,P2=200,P3=73). No arrivals have concluded for three consecutive periods despite promised L=2, indicating lead time is longer or shipments delayed/lost. Recent realized demand (Period1-3 concludes) = [99,102,75], mean=92. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed delays and protect against stockouts given long in-transit uncertainty. I set mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to base the (1+L) demand forecast on the latest regime (mean=92 \u2192 (1+3)*92). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. This balances service level (higher L and recent demand mean raise base stock) against holding cost by using only recent demand rather than the larger historical pre-shift series.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed Periods 1\u20133 (168+200+73 = 441 units) have not concluded by Period 3 conclude, suggesting actual lead time >2 periods or lost/delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1440.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand regime is high (samples 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 avg ~142) and current on-hand=118, in-transit=241. History: P2 order (200) arrived in Period 4, giving observed lead_time=2 for that order; P1 (168) and P3 (73) remain in-transit without conclusion and may be delayed/lost. To reflect the confirmed lead time and elevated recent demand, set L by calculating observed lead times, and set demand estimates using the most recent high-demand regime (last 3 samples). This raises target base stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new higher mean while sigma uses recent variability to size safety stock. These choices help the OR backend increase service without excessive holdings given holding cost is low ($1) vs profit $19.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 conclude).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand regime (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) remains elevated (~125\u2013153 weekly). On-hand=49, in-transit=241 (matches outstanding orders 168+200+73 minus 200 that arrived =241). Lead time evidence (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) confirms at least some 2-period arrivals; no new sustained lead-time shifts. To balance service vs holding cost, keep promised lead time and use a recent-window demand estimate that captures the higher regime: set L=default (promised 2), mu_hat based on the most recent 3 high-demand samples, and keep sigma_hat default to reflect historical volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent weekly demand has trended down from ~100 to ~50 over Periods 1\u20136 (demands: 99,102,75,82,69,53). On-hand=0, in-transit=319 (sizable pipeline). Promised lead time=2 and lead time was confirmed as 2 periods by Period 4 conclude, so use default lead time. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 5 demand observations to capture the downshift while keeping variance estimate responsive. This reduces overstating replenishment given large in-transit stock and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=319. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Recent demand shows one large spike (273 in Period 7) but not a sustained new regime; overall recent weekly demand averages are moderate. Use promised/default lead time to match observed confirmation. Use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to be responsive to the recent spike without overfitting a single-week outlier. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility including the spike. These choices balance service (respond to upward demand signal) against holding cost and account for in-transit stock and possible past missing shipments.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=561. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 (Period2->4, Period6->8). Recent demand shows elevated and volatile demand after the Jan regime shift; last 5 observed demands (P4\u2013P8 = 82,69,53,273,126) capture current volatility and include the large spike. Set L via calculate to use observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to make the OR backend target stock reflecting the recent higher mean and volatility while avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples. This balances service (capture recent uplift and spike risk) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=617 (covers ~3 periods of demand). Recent demand shows elevated and variable demand with a large spike in Period 7; to balance service vs holding cost I use a short recent window to adapt to current regime while relying on promised lead time which has been confirmed. Set L=default (promised=2). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 5\u20139) so the base-stock adapts to recent higher mean and volatility while avoiding overreaction to single outlier spikes.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent history shows confirmed lead times mostly =2 (three observations) and one =1; average observed lead time = 1.75, so use calculate to reflect observed mean. Demand regime shifted upward in late Jan (recorded earlier); recent demand is volatile with a large spike (Period 7=273). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 demand observations (Periods 6\u201310: 53,273,126,66,88) to capture the current higher/volatile demand regime. On-hand=288 and in-transit=241 yield large pipeline; these parameters (L=calculate, mu_hat recent_N=5, sigma_hat recent_N=5) will make the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances service (captures heightened mean) against holding cost given current inventory.

Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=151, in-transit=330. Historical concluded lead times: observed mostly 2 periods (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P8\u2192P10) with one 1-period (P9\u2192P10); demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 with volatile recent weeks (demands: 82,69,53,273,126,66,88,137). Given consistent evidence that actual lead time \u22482 and recent demand regime is elevated and variable, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (lets backend average confirmed values) and use recent_N on demand and volatility to focus the forecast on the latest 8 weeks to capture the current elevated mean and variability. These choices bias orders to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the new regime while letting the OR engine compute service-level sizing using profit vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Demand has shown a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (earlier carry-over noted). Recent on-hand=53, in-transit=388; several past orders have confirmed actual lead time ~2 (Period 2->4, 6->8, 8->10). I keep L as default (promised=2). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, using the last 9 concluded demand periods (regime length P4\u2013P12 = 9) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent demand while limiting noise. This balances higher service (reduce stockouts given heavy recent demand) against holding cost by using a recent-sample forecast rather than all-time mean.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=81, in-transit=380. Observed concluded lead times show mostly 2-period receipts (with one 1-period), so use calculated average lead time from concluded history to let backend capture slight deviation from promised L=2. Demand recently (last 5 periods) averaged ~90 units/week with moderate variability; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on this most relevant regime and limit influence of early low-demand samples. This balances service (cover upcoming (1+L) periods) against holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

I set L to the calculated average to reflect the slight under-2 mean from observed arrivals. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, providing a balanced base-stock given the inferred lead time and current healthy pipeline (on-hand + in-transit \u2248380 units). This keeps service levels aligned with observed demand while avoiding excessive explicit overrides given limited sample size for a new regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=402. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead times mostly 2 periods with one 1-period exception (observed lead_times = [2,2,2,1,2,2]); recent evidence supports average lead time slightly under 2 but close to promised. Demand has been elevated since 2019-01-21 (regime shift) and recent weeks remain variable. I set L="calculate" so backend uses observed average lead time (captures the occasional 1-period arrival). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast on the latest demand regime (last 8 weeks) so base_stock reflects recent elevated and variable demand while limiting influence of older low-demand weeks. This balances service level against holding cost given profit $19 and holding $1.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times with one 1-period event; average observed lead time \u22481.83 so use calculated average. Recent demand (Periods 11\u201316 = 137,98,61,81,86,94) appears to be the current regime (mean \u224892.8) after earlier jump and isolated spike at Period 7; use recent_N=6 to capture this regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of demand) while avoiding excess stock given holding cost $1 and profit $19.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=26, in-transit=322. Historical concludes show observed lead times consistently 2 periods (e.g., Period2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8, P11\u2192P13, P12\u2192P14, P15\u2192P17), so use default promised L=2. Recent demand (Periods 13\u201317: 61,81,86,94,54) represents the current regime after earlier one-off spikes; to capture current mean/volatility I use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This biases orders toward meeting the recent ~75 weekly demand while limiting exposure to the earlier extreme spike and balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concluded lead times consistently show 2 periods (observed multiple P->P+2 arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=322 (large pipeline). Recent demand has settled to a lower but variable regime: last 6 concluded demands = [61,81,86,94,54,43], mean \u224876.5. To capture the recent regime while using confirmed lead time, choose L=default (promised 2), mu_hat based on the most recent 6 periods to reflect current demand level across review+lead, and sigma_hat based on the recent 6 to capture current variability. This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent lower mean while the pipeline (322) will reduce immediate ordering pressure and avoid excess holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P15\u2013P19 = 86,94,54,43,112) averages ~77.8/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=322 \u2014 pipeline comfortably covers (1+L)=3 periods * recent mean (~233). Historic concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=2 (earlier missing shipments resolved; lead_time confirmed). To be responsive to the recent regime and avoid overstock from older high spikes, I use L=default (promised 2), mu_hat based on recent_N (last 5 weeks) to capture current demand level, and sigma_hat recent_N (last 5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned to current demand while the large in-transit balance prevents additional ordering that would raise holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=322. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 2 (matches promised). Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21; to capture recent elevated demand I use a recent window to estimate demand across the review+lead period. I set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds base_stock from recent demand mean and volatility, balancing higher recent demand against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has stayed at an elevated regime since 2019-01-21; last 9 concluded demands (Periods 13\u201321) average ~89 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=361 (sizable pipeline). Observed actual lead times have been 2 periods consistently; use promised lead time. To target service while controlling holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1), set L to default (promised=2). Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current elevated regime (3-period coverage because 1+L=3) so the OR engine forecasts demand across review+lead appropriately and the capped ordering prevents excessive single-period replenishment given pipeline.

Observed concluded lead times are mostly 2 (one 1) so use calculated average lead time to let backend reconcile minor variability. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current elevated regime (covers the latest ~2 months of activity) so the OR engine raises the base-stock to meet near-term demand while limiting excess inventory buildup.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent weeks show sustained high demand (Periods 19\u201323 demands = 112,134,139,132,95; recent mean ~122) after the earlier regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=359 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times are predominantly 2 periods (multiple confirmed 2-period arrivals, occasional 1-period single shipments). To reflect the empirically observed lead time while letting the backend compute the exact average, set L using 'calculate'. Forecast demand using the recent regime (last 5 weeks) so mu_hat=recent_N (N=5); likewise capture recent volatility with sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5). These choices prioritize service through higher recent demand while leveraging the large in-transit pipeline to limit excess ordering and holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weekly demand has been consistently high since the Jan spike (recent demands: 112,134,139,132,95,111 and prior weeks) and on-hand is 0 with 420 units in-transit. Historical concludes show actual lead time \u22482 (many concluded orders show 2). Use promised lead time (default) and bias forecast toward recent regime by using recent_N on demand and volatility to capture current higher mean/variance and avoid overstock from older low-demand samples. recent_N N=12 uses the most recent data window to reflect current summer demand pattern while sigma_recent captures recent variability for service-level sizing.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weeks show consistently high weekly demand (~80\u2013140) after the Jan spike; historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time \u22482 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=420 which should cover (L+1) periods of demand if L\u22482. I set L using calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (most concludes show 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=19) to focus the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime since Period 7 (regime length \u224819 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current elevated mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded lead times average ~1.9 (mostly 2, occasional 1 or 3), so use estimated lead time via calculate to reflect observed history. Demand elevated and volatile since early 2019 (recent periods show frequent demands 80\u2013139 with spikes), so set demand forecast using recent data (recent_N=10) to capture current regime. Use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current mean/variance and avoid dilution by early low-season samples. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given large pipeline and lead-time variability) against holding cost by letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap parameter.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded lead times are mostly 2 periods with occasional 1 and one 3; overall average best reflects central tendency. Recent demand remains in the elevated regime established 2019-01-21; use a recent-window forecast to capture current mean/volatility (reduces influence of the very-low early samples). Chosen methods: L=calculate to use average of observed lead times (captures observed mix of 1\u20133 but centers on 2); mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 to set (1+L)\xd7mean over last 9 demand samples (captures recent elevated demand while smoothing short dips); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat after regime shift) against holding cost by using recent data rather than all-time mean, and lets the backend cap orders per its policy given the in-transit stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Recent demand has settled below early-year spike: last 5 concluded demands = [111,81,60,57,68] (mean \u224875). Observed lead times vary but majority recent concluded arrivals show 2-period lead (occasional 1 or 3). To reflect empirical lead-time behavior use calculate (average of observed lead times). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast to the recent lower-demand regime and recent volatility. This keeps (1+L)-period demand aligned with current demand, while the OR engine's cap will limit order size to avoid excessive holding given holding cost=1 and profit=19.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times with a recent 3-period instance but the last three observed lead times average 2.0; demand has fallen from spring peaks and the last 7 demand samples (Periods 23\u201329: 95,111,81,60,57,68,37) indicate a lower recent mean. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent realized lead-time average (2.0) while being responsive to recent variability. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to base mu_hat on the latest lower-demand regime across the review+lead period. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility rather than older high-variance spring data. These choices balance service (using short-run observed lead time) and holding cost (downweighting older high-demand periods) while accounting for substantial in-transit stock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent demand has declined from the spring spike (Jan\u2013May) to a lower summer level (last 4 concluded demands: P27\u2013P30 = 57,68,37,37). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (mostly 2, with occasional 1 and one 3); use aggregate to reflect measured variability. Choices: L=calculate to set lead time equal to the average of observed concluded lead times (captures the realized variability vs promised 2); mu_hat=recent_N with N=4 to base (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent low-demand regime (reduces overstocking vs using full historical spike); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=4 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices keep orders responsive to the current lower-demand regime while acknowledging lead-time variability and the large in-transit volume to avoid excess ordering and holding cost.

Several earlier periods showed delayed/missing arrivals but recent concluded data center around 2. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to capture the slight downward bias below the promised 2 while reflecting variability. Demand forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use defaults so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, leveraging the full history to smooth spikes (e.g., the Jan\u2013Feb regime shift) and avoid overreacting to recent noisy weeks. This balances service level (using observed lead time) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show actual lead time \u22482 periods repeatedly; promised L=2 is appropriate. Recent demand (Periods 27\u201332 = 57,68,37,37,37,32; avg\u224844.7) is materially lower than earlier spike regime. I set L to default (use promised 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new lower-demand regime while accounting for the (1+L) review+lead window; this prevents overstating mean/volatility given the large in-transit stock and helps avoid excess holding cost while still covering near-term demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 27\u201332: avg demand decreased to 44.7 (periods 27\u201332) from prior higher levels (sustained for 6 periods).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent data shows a sustained lower-demand regime from Periods 27\u201332 (avg \u224844.7) but Period 33 had a one-off spike (90). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Promised lead time = 2 and prior concluded evidence confirms LT=2 for several orders. I set L=default to trust the promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (the detected lower-demand regime length, Periods 27\u201332) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of those 6 recent samples to reflect the new lower baseline and avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. These choices lower target base stock relative to older high-demand periods and mitigate holding cost risk given substantial pipeline inventory and confirmed LT=2.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand is in a lower regime vs early 2019 (Periods 27\u201334 recent weekly demands: 57,68,37,37,37,32,90,47). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead times show mostly 2 with one 3-period observation; to be robust I use a short recent average. I choose L as recent_N to capture the small upward jitter in lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (captures last 8 weeks). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. These settings let the OR backend compute a base-stock that respects current lower demand while accounting for pipeline inventory and slightly elevated observed lead-time variability.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Recent concluded lead times show variability (mostly 2, occasional 1 and one 3); no new sustained lead-time breach or lost-shipment pattern since Period 33. Demand has been lower than the early 2019 spike; recent weeks (Periods 30\u201335) show mixed low-to-moderate demand. I set L=calculate to let the backend use the average of observed concluded lead times (captures the variable 1\u20133 period observations). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 demand samples, adapting to the current lower-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes. This balances service level (using observed lead-time average) against holding cost (recent demand-focused mu/sigma reduces overstocks given large in-transit pipeline).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been lower than early-year spikes; last 10 concluded weekly demands (Periods 27\u201336) average ~51 with moderate variance; on-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Recent observed lead times center on 2 periods so keep promised lead time. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime and give the OR engine a demand forecast tied to the most recent pattern, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 samples (recent_N=10). This keeps orders aligned with current demand while the large in-transit quantity will be used by the backend to limit new orders via its capping rule, reducing holding cost risk.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded arrivals show typical lead time around 2 periods and recent demand has settled lower since Periods 27\u201332. Pipeline (423) likely covers several upcoming weeks so use promised lead time to let backend account for L=2 while sizing demand from the most recent regime. I select recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the last 11 observed demand periods (Periods 27\u201337) so the base-stock and cap respond to the lower recent demand and observed volatility; keep L as default (promised) so OR engine uses stated lead time when computing pipeline needs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand has settled well below the early-2019 spike; last 11 concluded demands (Periods 28\u201338) show lower, variable weekly demand (~37\u201390, recent mostly 40\u201370). In-transit = 423 and on-hand = 0; promised lead time = 2 and historical concluded arrivals largely show a 2-period lead time with occasional 3. I keep L as default (promised 2). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=11) to capture the current lower regime while smoothing short spikes. I use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=11) to reflect recent volatility. These choices give the OR backend a (1+L)-period demand estimate centered on the current lower regime and a volatility estimate based on recent variability, helping balance service level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit) versus holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Periods 27\u201332 (avg ~44.7) and has remained moderate since; on-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times historically vary (1\u20133) but promised lead time is 2 and recent concluded evidence supports 2; use promised lead time to avoid overreacting to missing/unconcluded shipments. Set L=default to use promised 2. For demand I use a recent_N approach (N=6) to capture the lowered regime (6-period regime detected) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 6 samples. Match sigma_hat to recent variability with recent_N N=6. These choices keep orders aligned with the current lower demand regime while the large in-transit stock limits additional ordering risk and helps the OR engine trade service level vs holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime versus earlier spikes (recent periods ~35\u201371, avg ~45). In-transit is 423 and on-hand 0; several earlier shipments clarified actual lead time ~2 and later arrivals align with promised L=2, so use default promised lead time. To capture the recent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (covering the most recent 6 demand periods) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current regime. This keeps orders aligned to current lower demand while acknowledging existing large pipeline to avoid over-ordering and minimize holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime vs earlier peaks: last 9 concluded weekly demands (Periods 33\u201341) average \u224854 units/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=423 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times have mostly been 2 periods (with occasional 1 or 3), so average observed lead time \u22482. To avoid over-reacting to past high peaks while honoring current lower demand, set L to be computed from observed lead times (calculate). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent data (recent_N, N=9) to reflect the sustained lower regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to capture current volatility. This balances service (using recent demand) and holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concludes show actual lead time \u22482 (confirmed earlier) so use promised/default L=2. Demand experienced a sustained downward regime beginning around Period 27 (avg ~44.7 over P27\u201332) so prioritize recent demand when forecasting; a single large spike at Period 42 (144) is not yet a sustained shift. Use recent_N=12 to capture the post-changepoint regime while allowing some recent variability. This reduces overstating mu_hat (avoids excess holding) while keeping service against typical recent demand; sigma_hat recent_N=12 captures recent volatility for safety stock.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 \u2014 substantial pipeline from prior orders (some long-delayed). Recent concluded lead-times have mostly been 2 (with occasional 3), so retain promised lead time for OR but rely on recent demand to avoid overstating demand. Recent demand is mixed but lower on-average than the early 2019 spike; last 6 observed demands (Periods 38\u201343) = [71,52,35,33,144,38], so I use a recent_N estimate (N=6) to capture current regime and volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand while the OR backend uses promised L. No explicit sigma value provided so backend computes sample std over recent N.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 2 periods (some occasional 3), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 39\u201344 = 52,35,33,144,38,57) shows mostly low-to-moderate weekly demand with one large spike (144) likely a short-lived outlier. To be responsive to current pattern while weighting recent weeks, I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds base stock for (1+L) review+lead horizon using the immediate demand regime. L left as default (promised=2) so arrivals align with supplier promise and OR backend assumptions. This balances service (capture ongoing moderate demand and cover uncertainty) against holding cost given large in-transit position (423 units) already en route.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=423. Recent demand (last 6 periods: P41\u2013P46 conclude series) is mixed with a one-time spike (144) but otherwise moderate (30s\u201350s); earlier sustained regime shifts already recorded. Multiple prior lead-time observations confirm typical actual lead time ~2 periods. Given large in-transit volume and confirmed lead time=2, use promised/default lead time to let backend treat pipeline normally. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the most recent demand mix (captures recent drop after earlier high periods) so base-stock targets respond to current levels. Use default sigma_hat so backend computes volatility from full sample history (conservative spread estimate). This balances service (q\u22480.95) while avoiding further over-ordering given substantial in-transit inventory.

Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods with occasional 1 and 3 \u2014 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history includes a sustained regime shift earlier (higher avg around 2019-01-21\u20132019-02-04) and later lower regime; no new sustained demand/lead-time change in the last 3+ periods. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)*mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR engine applies its base-stock formula given the averaged lead time; this balances service level (through L-estimate) with holding cost (default \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 avoid overreacting to short recent spikes while pipeline is already large).
