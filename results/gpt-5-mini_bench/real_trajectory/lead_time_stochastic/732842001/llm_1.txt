  "rationale": "a) World/product: SKU is ladies skinny denim; no major seasonal event on 2019-02-11 besides Valentine\u2019s (mid-Feb) which can modestly lift apparel demand but not huge for this SKU. b) Demand regime: historical weekly demand shows a sharp, sustained rise: 2019-01-07=0, 01-14=1, 01-21=36, 01-28=100, 02-04=215 \u2014 clear upward regime beginning 2019-01-21. c) Lead time & missing orders: Promised lead_time=2 periods.

To balance high stock cost vs. need to supply rising demand and given 2-period promised lead time (so order placed now will only arrive after two periods), I choose a conservative replenishment to begin meeting the new regime while limiting holding exposure.
