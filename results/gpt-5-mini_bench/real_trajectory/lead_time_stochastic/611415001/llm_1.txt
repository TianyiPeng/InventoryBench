Demand analysis: recent realized weekly demand ~100\u2013135; using a conservative forecast of ~120 units/week. Lead time & pipeline: Concluded history shows supplier delivering in 1\u20132 periods recently (no persistent new delay). On-hand=0, In-transit=427 units \u2014 pipeline already exceeds (L+1)=3 periods of demand (3*120=360). Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so excess inventory quickly erodes reward. No new sustained regime or lead-time shift evident. Order decision: place 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding cost while existing in-transit inventory covers expected near-term demand.",
