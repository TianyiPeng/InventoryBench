Given demand ~35\u201340/week and a likely small Valentine\u2019s bump this period, target coverage \u22483\xd730\u201335 to balance service vs high holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period equals profit).

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, typically low apparel demand). Product: seasonal women\u2019s jersey top \u2014 not a clear year-end gift driver. Demand analysis: recent realized weekly demand (P42\u2013P46) = [107,18,34,41,27], average \u224845 but dominated by single spike P42 (Black Friday week). Last six non-spike weeks are low (\u224830/week). Lead time / arrivals: historical actual LT variable (1\u20133) but we have 258 units currently in-transit and 0 on-hand. Inventory/pipeline: in-transit 258 alone would cover multiple weeks even under high-demand regimes (e.g., at 100/week covers ~2.5 weeks; under ~30\u201340/week covers 6\u20138 weeks). Cost tradeoff: profit per unit = $1 but holding cost = $1/ unit/period \u2014 carrying inventory erodes all profit quickly. Given large existing pipeline and high holding cost, placing additional order risks net negative reward. Final decision: place no new order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs and to let in-transit stock absorb upcoming demand while monitoring actual arrivals to reassess lead-time or lost shipments.",
