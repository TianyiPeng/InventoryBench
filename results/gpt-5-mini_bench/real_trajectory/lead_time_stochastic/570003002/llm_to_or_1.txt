Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (35,53,41,57,52) show mean \u2248 47.6. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover review+lead demand. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet, and no sustained regime shift detected. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility aggregations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent weekly sample mean = 47.6 units (samples: 35,53,41,57,52). On-hand=0, in-transit=63 (order placed Period 1) but Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0 for that order \u2014 single-period delay observed, not yet confirmation of changed lead time or loss. Promised lead time is 2; no sustained evidence to override. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding, symmetric), use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend applies its base-stock formula using full-sample mean/variance across the (1+L)-period horizon. This keeps ordering conservative until lead-time/demand regime shifts are confirmed.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand mean ~47.6 (samples: 35,53,41,57,52). On-hand=0, in-transit=136 (ordered P1=63, P2=73) with no concluded arrivals; cannot infer actual lead time yet. Use promised lead time (default) because no arrival confirms a lead-time shift or lost shipment. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding so q=0.5 and no strong evidence of demand regime change.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=180, profit= $1/unit equals holding cost $1/unit so critical service/holding tradeoff. No concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20133 (orders placed but arrived=0), so actual lead time is unconfirmed. I use default lead time (promised L=2) because there is no concluded arrival evidence to compute a new average. Demand history (five weekly samples mean=47.6) informs default forecasts: mu_hat default => (1+L)*mean = 3 * 47.6 \u2248 142.8; sigma_hat default uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L) \u2248 15.95. These default choices let the OR backend compute the base-stock and cap while we await concluded arrivals; they avoid overreacting to possibly lost/delayed shipments while ensuring coverage for (L+1) periods.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have not concluded (arrived=0) despite in-transit=180 units; possible lead time >2 or lost shipments (evidence: P1 ordered=63, P2=73, P3=44, no arrivals by Period 4 conclude).

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weeks show elevated demand (P1..P4 demands: 71,109,74,77) vs earlier historical baseline. In-transit=112 but earlier orders P1 and P3 still unconcluded \u2014 P2 arrival in Period 4 confirms at least some 2-period lead times. I choose L=calculate to use observed lead-time data (captures confirmed 2-period observation). To capture the recent demand surge, mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 (uses Periods 1\u20134 demands) so the OR backend will size base-stock to recent higher mean and volatility, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4: ordered=73, arrived=73; observed lead_time=2).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent observed weekly demand has risen vs historical (recent 5-week mean \u224878 vs historical mean \u224847.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=224 (some prior orders delayed but Period 4 conclude confirmed a 2-period lead time for Period 2 order). I set L via 'calculate' to use observed lead-time evidence (backend will average observed lead times, currently supporting 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 5 demands) so the OR engine raises target base-stock to meet stronger demand while accounting for 1-period review + lead time. This balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5), relying on recent demand rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent weekly demand samples average ~51 (historical 35,53,41,57,52) with current on-hand=42 and in-transit=122. Arrival history shows variable lead times: observed arrivals imply lead times of 2 (P2->P4) and 1 (P5->P6). Some earlier orders were delayed but later arrivals confirm variability rather than permanent loss. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures recent 2 and 1); mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using full sample set\u2014this balances service against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and the uncertain/variable lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1\u20137) averaged ~76.6 units vs historical sample mean 47.6 (2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04) \u2014 a sustained upward regime for 7 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=149 (covers ~1.95 weeks at current demand). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4) and 1 (P5\u2192P6) => use average observed lead time. I set L to 'calculate' so backend infers average observed lead time (1.5). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to reflect the new higher-demand regime (so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_of_last_7). For volatility I use recent_N N=7 to capture current demand variability. These choices increase target base-stock to meet higher recent demand while using observed lead-time evidence; they also avoid overreacting to older low-demand samples and help the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given in-transit coverage and shipment uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean 47.6 (2019-01-07\u21922019-02-04) increased to 76.6 avg (Periods 1\u20137, 2019-02-11\u21922019-03-25), +61% over 7 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand elevated: recent 7-period average \u224876.6 vs historical 47.6 (confirmed upshift). Observed concluded lead times = {P4:2, P6:1, P8:2, P8:1} \u2192 average 1.5. On-hand=0, in-transit=193 (some arrivals recently inconsistent). To balance higher demand and shipment variability: set L to calculated average lead time so backend accounts for observed lead-time variability; use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (use last 7 demand samples for mean and volatility). This increases target base stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat based on recent data preserves safety buffer against variability and delayed arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime (carry-over previously recorded: average \u224876.6 over Periods 1\u20137). On-hand=0, in-transit=231 (some in-transit shipments have arrived inconsistently in 1\u20132 periods). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1} \u2192 average ~1.5; I select L by averaging observed lead times. For demand I use the most recent regime (N=7) to capture the confirmed higher mean; sigma is estimated from the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward meeting the higher recent demand while letting the OR backend compute safety stock using profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=85, in-transit=112. Historical concludes show mixed actual lead times (observed sequence 2,1,2,1,2,1 \u2192 avg ~1.5) and a sustained demand regime shift earlier (Periods 1\u20137 avg \u224876.6). To balance service vs holding given uncertain but centered ~1.5 LT, I let the backend compute L from observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=7) to capture the identified regime (7-period elevated mean) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent demand. For sigma I use recent_N (N=7) to capture recent volatility. These choices adapt to the confirmed regime shift while letting the OR engine handle precise base-stock sizing despite occasional delayed/lost shipments.

On-hand=0, in-transit=112 \u2014 pipeline exists but arrivals have been inconsistent historically; observed lead times vary (1 and 2), so use observed-average for L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime while still reflecting recent variability. These parameters bias the base-stock up to meet higher demand but use recent data to limit excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=198. Historical concluded lead-times vary (observed 1 and 2 periods); demand has a sustained upward regime since Periods 1\u20137 (avg ~76.6 vs historical 47.6). To capture the confirmed higher recent demand while letting the backend infer the effective lead time from observed arrivals, I set L to 'calculate' (average observed lead times). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N=7 to focus the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the 7-period elevated-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=211. History shows mixed observed lead times (1 and 2 periods); average observed lead time ~1.5. Demand regime increased earlier (carry-over) so I use a recent-sample forecast. I set L to be calculated from all observed lead times to let backend average the 1/2 observations. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (captures the most recent regime sample from Periods 7\u201313) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast reflects the higher recent mean and volatility while avoiding older low-demand data. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding, and accounts for in-transit stock likely covering part of the forecast but possible lost shipments will be handled by the averaged L estimate.

Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed lead_times = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2], average \u22481.57) so I use the calculated average lead time to let backend infer L. Demand shows a sustained upward regime starting around Period 1\u20137 with higher recent demand; I select recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime (uses the most recent 7 demand observations).

Historical concluded lead-times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods; recent observed lead-times (last 7 concluded observations) average ~1.5 so I use recent_N to capture that mix. Demand has shifted up vs. 2019-Jan baseline; I use recent_N (last 7 demand observations, Periods 9\u201315) to capture the current regime and volatility. These choices make L reflect recent delivery variability and set mu_hat/sigma_hat from the most recent demand regime so the OR engine computes a base-stock that balances service (higher recent mean) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=194. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed sequence: 2,1,2,1,2,1,2 \u2192 avg \u22481.57) so use aggregated observed lead time. Demand has shifted up vs. 2019 sample mean; recent demands (Periods 10\u201316) average \u224867.6. To capture the recent higher demand while keeping volatility estimation recent, set L by averaging observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 7 demand periods (N=7) so the backend bases orders on recent regime. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by using recent volatility for sigma_hat.

Demand has shown a sustained higher regime since Period 8; to capture recent demand I use the last 7 periods for mean and std (balances recent spikes vs variability).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Recent history shows observed lead times of mostly 1\u20132 periods (avg \u22481.44 across concluded arrivals) and a sustained demand regime shift upward since Period 8 (avg ~76.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=136 (pipeline present). I set L to "calculate" so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 behavior rather than the promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (use the last 12 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N N=12 to reflect recent demand dispersion. These choices bias orders toward higher coverage for the new regime while letting the OR engine compute safety stock given the inferred lead time, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=205 (covers some future demand but past shipments showed mixed 1\u20132 period actual lead times). Use promised lead time to keep OR backend aligned with contractual LT while biasing demand estimate toward the recent higher regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (7-period regime observed at Period 8). This increases base stock to improve service given high recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Recent demand has been higher than the 2019 historical baseline (baseline mean 47.6); the post-changepoint regime (since Period 8) shows elevated demand \u2014 recent 15-period window still confirms higher mean and volatility. On-hand=18, in-transit=147 (sufficient pipeline coverage for multiple periods but some prior orders showed mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals). I set L=calculate to let backend use the average of observed lead times (history shows frequent 1\u20132 period realizations, so average < promised 2). For demand I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 15 samples) and apply recent_N N=15 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward vs. the long-run baseline to protect service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the backend's cap limit excess ordering and control holding cost.

Historical concluded lead times fluctuate between 1\u20132 periods with many recent confirmations of 2; no sustained shift beyond promised lead time.

Use promised lead time to keep policy aligned with supplier promise and let OR engine use full history for demand moments. Choosing default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given in-transit supply already available.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=197. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (recent average \u22481.6), and demand has been volatile with a lower recent mean than the earlier spike. To balance service vs holding given profit=holding cost, I use an empiric lead-time estimate (calculate) so the OR backend learns the observed average. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 19\u201325) where demand samples = [82,76,64,51,49,65,42], reflecting current traffic; sigma_hat uses the same recent 7 samples to reflect recent volatility. With these choices the backend will size base_stock to recent demand levels while the calculate lead-time lets it adapt to the observed 1\u20132 period mix; in-transit=197 currently provides substantial coverage versus the recent mean so this reduces unnecessary new orders.

LLM Rationale:

History shows variable observed lead times (1\u20133) with recent concluded arrival at Period 26 showing a 3-period delay for the P23 order; earlier lead time repeatedly 2. Demand has a sustained higher regime vs. 2019 Jan (carry-over notes: recent avg ~76.6 over Periods1\u20137). To be responsive to recently higher demand while hedging delayed arrivals, I set L using recent observed lead times to capture current delivery behavior, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent-N demand window reflecting the detected regime shift (regime length ~7). These parameters encourage the OR backend to raise target stock to meet higher demand but still respect the capped order policy to limit overshoot given uncertain arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=168. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed average \u22481.69 periods) with recent occasional 3-period delays; demand regime shifted up around Period 8 and has persisted. To capture the true realized lead time I use calculate (average of observed lead times). For demand I use a recent_N estimate reflecting the sustained higher-demand regime since Period 8: regime length = 20 periods, so recent_N=20 to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the most relevant recent data. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock upward to preserve service under the higher-demand regime and account for observed lead-time variability, while letting the OR backend cap orders per its policy.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=187. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed samples average ~1.69 periods) with occasional 3-period delays but recent confirmations of 2-period arrivals; demand regime previously shifted higher (Periods 1\u20137 avg increased to ~76.6). Given mixed but measurable actual lead-time evidence, I use the calculated average lead time to better reflect observed arrivals. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std (leveraging all samples) to compute base-stock and the capped order \u2014 this balances higher service-level need from the elevated demand regime while letting the backend handle safety stock sizing under the inferred lead time.

Observed concluded lead times (13 observations) average \u22481.69 \u2192 use calculated average lead time. Use recent_N (last 7 demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the returned lower-demand regime and current volatility. This keeps orders aligned to recent demand while accounting for observed lead-time behavior and avoids overstocking given holding cost equals profit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9. Recent demand has fallen from the earlier high regime; last 6 observed weekly demands = [42,43,34,40,34,39], avg ~38.7. On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); most recent concluded arrivals (Periods 26\u201330) show lead times = [3,2,3,2,2]. To balance service vs holding given current lower demand and substantial pipeline, I set L using recent lead-time evidence (average of last 5 observed lead times) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 6 demand samples so the OR engine scales forecast to current lower regime while accounting for observed lead-time variability.

Carry-over insight: Recent lead time increased: last 5 concluded lead-time observations (Periods 26\u201330 arrivals) = [3,2,3,2,2], recent average = 2.4

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent concluded lead-times show a slight increase (last 5 observed = [3,2,3,2,2], avg 2.4) so I will bias L upward by using a recent average. Demand since Period 25 has been lower than the earlier high-regime (recent demands for Periods 25\u201331 = [42,43,34,40,34,39,60], mean \u2248 39.7), so I use a recent-window demand forecast (7 periods) for mu_hat and matching recent volatility for sigma_hat. This keeps safety stock aligned to the most recent realized demand while acknowledging slightly longer recent lead times; it helps the OR backend avoid over-ordering for the older high-demand regime and account for modest lead-time lengthening. In-transit=160 will be reconciled by the backend when computing pipeline; chosen parameters focus forecasting on the last 7 demand periods and last 5 lead-time observations.

Recent concluded lead-times (Periods 26\u201330) = [3,2,3,2,2] (avg 2.4) so I use recent lead-time averaging to capture slight increase vs promised=2. Recent demand (Periods 29\u201333) = [34,39,60,36,43], mean\u224842.4; demand has moderated below earlier spike, so I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to reflect current regime. Volatility will also use recent 5 samples. These settings make the OR backend compute base-stock and cap using a lead-time closer to observed, and mu/sigma reflecting the most recent demand pattern; this balances service (avoid stockouts given in-transit uncertainty) against holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 28\u201334) centers ~41.7 units/week; I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, reflecting current lower post-peak demand while accounting for the longer recent lead time.

Recent demand has dropped from the earlier elevated regime (avg ~76.6) back toward pre-spike levels. Last 5 demand observations (Periods 31\u201335) = [60,36,43,40,46], mean \u224845. Use recent lead-time average to reflect observed drift and avoid underordering if shipments are slow/lost: set L via recent_N (N=5). Use recent demand (most recent 5 periods) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (reduces overstock risk given holding cost = profit). Use recent volatility (last 5) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects current variation. These choices balance service (respect observed longer lead times) against holding cost by sizing base stock to current demand and variability.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=160. Recent concluded lead times show variability with a recent average ~2.4 (evidence: several 3-period observations P26,P30,P36). Recent demand (last 7 periods P30\u2013P36 demands = [39,60,36,43,40,46,44]) averages ~44 units. To account for slightly longer recent lead time while using most-recent demand regime, set L to recent_N (N=5) and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, balancing service vs holding costs given profit=holding. This also hedges against observed occasional 3-period delays without overcommitting inventory.

Recent demand (Periods 31\u201337) shows a modestly higher level vs. 2019 Jan baseline (7-week mean \u224850) so set mu_hat to recent_N with N=7 to reflect current regime. Use default sigma_hat to let backend scale variability across (1+L). These settings balance service (capture recent higher demand and slightly longer lead time) against holding cost given equal profit/holding (q=0.5).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=160. Historical concluded lead-times show recent variability with a higher mean ~2.4 (mix of 2\u20133); some shipments delayed/lost earlier but lead-time evidence since Period 26 supports a longer-than-promised cadence. Demand recently is heterogeneous; using the most recent 7 demand observations captures current regime without over-weighting early 2019 samples. Therefore: set L via recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent concluded lead-time behavior; set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=7) to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the latest regime. This balances service (capture increased/variable lead time) against holding cost by sizing base-stock from recent demand and lead-time uncertainty while avoiding overcommitment given past lost/delayed shipments.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=160 (some past shipments delayed/lost historically). Recent concluded lead times show variability with a recent average ~2.4 (Periods 26\u201330); use recent_N to capture that. Recent demand (Periods 33\u201339) averages ~48 units/week, so use recent_N to focus forecast on the latest regime rather than the long-run historic mean. Using recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices help the OR engine set base_stock and cap using up-to-date lead-time and demand signals while avoiding overcommitment given holding cost = profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has varied since the Feb\u2013Mar surge; current on-hand=0, in-transit=160 (some past late arrivals suggest actual lead times > promised at times, but recent concluded lead-times average ~2.4). I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the empirical average of observed lead times (captures multi-period variability vs always using promised=2). For demand forecast and volatility I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples \u2014 this is conservative given mixed regime signals and avoids overfitting to short spikes. This balances service level (using observed lead time) against holding cost given profit=holding, producing z*\u22480 and relying on mean demand scaling to set base stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=174. Historical conclude messages show variable lead times with recent observed lead-times = [3,2,3,2,2] (avg=2.4) and recent demand (Periods 37\u201341) = [83,47,39,35,40], mean=48.8. There is no new 3+ period sustained demand regime shift since prior insights; choose L based on recent lead-time average (recent_N=5) to capture modestly elevated lead time. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast to the most recent demand regime (reduces stock risk vs. older high-demand period). These parameters guide the OR engine toward a base stock sized for current demand and slightly longer recent lead time while avoiding excess holding given holding cost = profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=174. Recent concluded lead-times show variability with a recent average >2 (last 5 concluded LT avg = 2.4) and multiple delayed/lost arrivals earlier; demand has been volatile with a recent uptick (last 7 demands mean \u224855.3). To protect service given uncertain/longer observed lead times, I set L based on recent lead-time observations. For demand I use a recent window (N=7) to capture the latest regime without over-weighting older low-demand history. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices increase base-stock to cover the longer effective pipeline while keeping safety stock responsive to recent demand variance and avoiding excessive inventory from older low-demand periods.

Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=160 with a history of variable actual lead times (observed 1\u20133 periods) and several delayed/missing arrivals earlier; recent demand (Periods 36\u201343) averages ~50 units/week, lower than the earlier spring surge. To balance service vs holding cost I use an L estimate based on observed lead-time history (let the backend calculate average observed lead time) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime (last 8 weeks) to capture the current lower-demand regime while keeping volatility computed over the same window so the OR backend's safety stock reflects recent variability. This addresses overdue/in-transit uncertainty by letting the backend infer mean lead time from concluded arrivals while giving mu/sigma focused on the recent demand pattern.

To reflect recent lead-time behavior while being responsive to current lower demand, estimate lead time from the last 5 observed lead times and forecast demand using the last 7 demand observations (both mean and std) so the OR backend sizes the base stock to recent conditions and caps orders to limit exposure to lost/delayed shipments.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=160. Historical demand shows higher recent variability vs original 2019 Jan mean; recent weeks (Periods 39\u201345) average demand \u224848.7 with a large spike (99) at Period 42. Lead-time history shows recent average \u22482.4 (Periods 26\u201330) and intermittent 3-period observations; therefore I use a recent average for lead time to reflect slower/more variable arrivals. To keep service with balanced holding cost (profit=holding \u2192 q=0.5 driven z*=0), I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent demand samples so the OR backend computes a base stock that reflects current demand regime and observed volatility. Methods chosen: L recent_N to capture recent lead-time length, mu_hat recent_N to capture current average demand over the review+lead period, sigma_hat recent_N to capture recent volatility. These choices help the OR engine order to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while accounting for increased lead-time risk and recent demand spike.

Recent concluded lead-times show increase (Periods 26\u201330: [3,2,3,2,2], recent avg 2.4) so I use recent lead-time averaging to capture longer/variable transport. Demand in recent weeks (Periods 40\u201346) is moderate (39,35,36,47,60) and below the earlier spike; use a recent window to reflect current regime and avoid overstocking. I choose recent_N (N=5) for L to lean on the most recent lead-time evidence, recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to estimate mean+volatility over the latest demand regime (capped reasonable window). These settings balance service (longer observed lead time) and holding cost by forecasting demand from the latest regime and increasing lead-time coverage so pipeline estimates are realistic given past delayed arrivals.
