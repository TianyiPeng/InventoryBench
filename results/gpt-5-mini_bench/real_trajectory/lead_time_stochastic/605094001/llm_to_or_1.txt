Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No 'Period X conclude' arrival messages exist to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Historical weekly demand samples available (5 weeks, mean ~151.2). Profit and holding costs equal ($1/$1) imply moderate service-level weight but no evidence of a demand regime shift or lead-time change. Use promised lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend applies its baseline (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=210 (order placed Period 1 not yet concluded \u2192 no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipment). Historical weekly samples (Jan 2019) show mean demand ~151 units/week; no sustained changepoint or seasonality evident yet. Use default lead time (promised L=2) because no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u2248151.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=395 which matches outstanding orders (210+185), so no confirmed lost shipments or lead-time change based on concluded messages (both prior concludes show arrived=0 which is expected until lead time elapses). Promised lead time remains the unbiased default. Using default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std) keeps the OR backend anchored to long-run sample statistics and lets the OR engine compute base_stock and cap given its profit/holding tradeoff. This balances service level vs. holding cost without overreacting to as-yet-unconfirmed arrival delays.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=395. Orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 have not concluded by Period 3 conclude (arrived=0), suggesting shipments are delayed or lost versus promised L=2. Demand history (warehouse samples) = [158,154,201,140,103], mean=151.2. I set L explicitly to 3 to hedge against observed delays (explicit longer lead time). For demand sizing I use default mu_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples (captures multi-period coverage with the longer L). For uncertainty I use default sigma_hat so backend scales sample std by sqrt(1+L). These choices increase pipeline coverage to protect service levels given missing arrivals while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit overstock risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-73.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent confirmed arrival: Period 4 conclude shows order placed on Period 2 arrived with lead_time=2. On-hand=129, in-transit=231 (some earlier orders not yet concluded; P1's order missing but not yet a sustained loss). I set L by calculating average observed lead times (only observed = 2 \u2192 use calculate) to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Demand history (2019-01 samples) used via defaults: mu_hat default = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to capture baseline demand across review+lead period; sigma_hat default to reflect full-sample volatility. This balances service (use observed L) vs holding cost by relying on full-sample estimates rather than short-run noisy changes.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand: P1-5 demands = [33,21,21,56,29]; no sustained (>3 periods) regime change, though P4 was a spike. One concluded arrival shows lead time = 2 (ordered P2 arrived P4). On-hand=100 + in-transit=231 gives pipeline cover; choose L by calculating average observed lead times (calculate) = 2. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture latest observed demand including the P4 spike without overreacting; mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean(last 5). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings balance service (capture recent spike) versus holding cost conservatively given existing inventory and observed lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Recent demand (Periods 4-6) has fallen sharply (56,29,11) vs. historical Jan mean (~151). On-hand=89, in-transit=231 (total pipeline=320) which comfortably covers expected demand over the review+lead period given a lower recent demand regime. Observed arrival in Period 4 confirms at least one order with lead_time=2 (ordered P2 arrived P4); an earlier large order (ordered P1=210) has not concluded and appears lost. I set L to calculate so the backend uses observed lead-times (evidence supports 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new lower-demand regime (use last 3 periods: 56,29,11). This keeps target base-stock low to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service with current pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods 4-6 avg demand = 32 vs prior Jan avg \u2248151 (\u221279%); Order from Period 1 (210 units) remains unarrived through Period 7 \u2192 likely lost

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent demand has collapsed vs Jan: Periods 4-7 demands = [56,29,11,22], recent avg \u224829.5 (vs Jan avg \u2248151). On-hand=67, in-transit=231 but prior history shows a lost P1 shipment; treat pipeline uncertainty conservatively. Lead-time evidence: one concluded arrival (P2\u2192P4) confirms observed lead time = 2. I set L using calculated observed lead times to reflect confirmed lead-time behavior. For demand I use a recent_N forecast (N=4) to capture the new low-demand regime (4-period regime length). For volatility I use recent_N (N=4) to reflect current lower variability. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the sustained lower demand and limit overstock given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent demand has shifted sharply down from Jan historical levels (earlier Jan avg \u2248151) to a much lower regime (Periods 4\u20138 avg \u224832\u201371 range), and one early large order (Period 1, 210) never concluded \u2192 likely lost; current on-hand=0, in-transit=231. Observed concluded lead time (Period4 arrival of Period2 order) = 2 periods, so use calculated average lead time. To capture the recent low-demand regime while allowing for the late spike in Period 8, set demand estimates using a recent-window estimate (last 5 periods = Periods 4\u20138) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new regime and recent variability. These choices keep base_stock aligned with current lower demand and reduce overstock risk given holding cost = profit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has dropped markedly from Jan levels; recent six concluded demands (P4\u2013P9) = [56,29,11,22,71,40], recent mean \u224838.2. Observed lead time from concluded arrivals = 2 (Period2\u2192Period4). One early order (Period1, 210) remains unarrived and likely lost; current in-transit = 231 likely includes outstanding/lost shipments. To respond to the new lower-demand regime while accounting for promised lead time and the observed 2-period lead, I use: L by calculate (average of observed lead times = 2) so the OR engine uses the empirically supported lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent_N (N=6) to capture the current demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over last 6 samples). This reduces over-ordering relative to using full-history Jan means and helps balance service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Recent demand is much lower than Jan historical (sustained drop since Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=231; one early order appears lost (Period 1) but we have a confirmed lead_time=2 observation (Period 2 arrival). I set L by calculating observed lead times to let backend use actual measured lead-time history. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (covers the sustained low-demand regime from Periods 4\u201310) so mu_hat reflects the current lower demand over the review+lead horizon. Sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=7 to capture recent volatility rather than full-sample variability. These choices reduce overordering versus using the high Jan mean while keeping service given confirmed LT=2 and existing in-transit stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has recovered from the low regime (Periods 4-6 avg \u224832) to higher mid-weekly levels (last 5 demands: 22,71,40,55,76; mean \u224852.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=231 (one early order remains unarrived long and was previously flagged as likely lost). No sustained evidence that actual lead time differs from promised (observed concluded lead_time=2). To target current demand while limiting holding cost, set lead time to default (promised=2), and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the most recent demand regime (short window captures the recent uptick).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=231. Historical Jan samples show mean\u2248151/wk; observed arrival (Period 4 conclude) confirms a 2-period lead time for the delivered order (Period 2\u21924). Period 1 order remained unarrived and likely lost, but arrivals confirming lead time=2 are present. I use the promised/confirmed lead time (L=2) and default demand moments so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/SD (captures historical demand level \u2248151) scaled by (1+L)=3 to compute base stock; this balances service (use full-sample demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=231. Historical concluded lead-time evidence: order placed P2 arrived P4 (lead_time=2); P1 order never arrived (likely lost). Recent demand (Periods 8-13 = 71,40,55,76,106,77) shows a sustained higher regime vs earlier low period (P4-6 avg=32). To reflect observed lead time use calculate (average of observed lead times =2). To capture the recent demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (Periods 8-13) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and volatility over the most relevant samples, balancing service level needs (higher demand) against holding cost, while acknowledging in-transit stock may include lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: avg demand P8-13 = 70.83 vs P4-6 = 32 (+121%); previously noted P1 order remains unarrived and likely lost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent demand has risen materially since Period 8 (P8-14 avg \u224874.7/week vs earlier lows). On-hand=0, in-transit=231; historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 2 for delivered orders (Period 2\u2192Period 4). One early large order (Period 1) remains unarrived and was previously flagged as likely lost; no new arrival evidence to change that. To capture the post-change demand regime, use a recent_N forecast over the 7-week regime (Periods 8\u201314). Keep lead time at the promised/default value so the OR engine uses the contractual L=2, while mu_hat and sigma_hat use the recent 7-sample regime to raise target base stock and measured volatility to meet service needs without overcommitting further given missing-shipment risk.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=231. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4); many recent periods (P8\u2013P15) form a new demand regime: demands = [71,40,55,76,106,77,98,123], mean=80.75. I keep L as promised (default=2) since observed lead time matches promise and no sustained contrary evidence. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=8 to capture the clear regime shift starting Period 8 (avg \u224880.75/week \u2192 (1+L)-period demand). This reduces risk of under-ordering given sustained higher demand while keeping variability estimated from the same recent window.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=243. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 8 (demands: 40,55,76,106,77,98,123,153 \u2192 recent mean \u224891). Earlier low-demand regime (Periods 4-6) and a likely lost Period 1 order were previously recorded. I keep lead time = promised (use default) because concluded arrivals support the promised 2-period lead time (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4, lead_time=2) and there is no systematic conclude evidence of a longer actual lead time. To align stocking with the observed higher-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 8 demand samples (Periods 9-16) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand using the recent higher mean and volatility. This raises the base-stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while relying on the capped order to limit excessive holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent periods show a sustained higher demand regime since Period 8 (recent 10-period mean \u224889 units) and observed lead times vary (P2\u2192P4 = 2, P16\u2192P17 = 1). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 261 (some earlier orders likely lost, but inconclusive for systematic lead-time change). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding), I use a short recent average lead time and base demand/volatility estimates on the most recent 10 demand observations to capture the post-changepoint demand level while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=268. History shows mixed observed lead times (P4: order from P2 had LT=2; P17: order from P16 had LT=1) and at least one lost/long-missing shipment (P1 order never concluded). Recent demand has shifted up (Periods 14-18: 98,123,153,93,50). To balance service vs holding cost: set lead-time estimate using the last 2 observed lead times to capture recent shortening but retain uncertainty (recent_N N=2). Set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) to reflect the higher recent demand pattern and its variability (recent_N N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat). This increases target base-stock to improve fill rates given overdue/lost earlier shipments while limiting excess inventory by using recent data.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 20 (2019-06-24): recent demand has rebounded vs early-period trough \u2014 latest demands (P16-P19): 153, 93, 50, 68 (high variability). On-hand=0, in-transit=304; multiple very-delayed shipments observed (earlier P1 order likely lost) so I won't trust promised lead time blindly. I set L to 'calculate' to use the average of observed lead times (uses concluded arrivals: 2,1,1 => avg\u22481.33) so backend adjusts review+lead horizon. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over last 6 samples). This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost and accounts for observed shipment unreliability by using inferred lead time.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Historical concluded lead times: 2, 1, 1 (recent 3). Recent demand has been elevated versus early periods; last 6 demands (P15-P20) = [123,153,93,50,68,53], avg \u224890. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect shorter recent lead times while allowing some inertia from the older 2-period observation. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over last 6 samples). These choices aim to raise target base-stock to meet current demand spikes while keeping safety stock responsive to recent volatility; using recent windows also avoids being misled by very old low-demand winter samples. I note an earlier large order (Period 1) remains unarrived and likely lost, so relying on recent observed arrivals is safer.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has rebounded from spring lows: P16-P21 demands = [153,93,50,68,53,82], avg \u224883.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=304 (pipeline sizable). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4), 1 (P17), 1 (P19) \u2014 recent evidence indicates shorter lead times than the promised 2. To target current demand regime while accounting for pipeline, I set L via recent_N (N=3) to average the three observed lead times (gives \u22481.33). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to base mu_hat on the most recent 6 periods (captures the recent higher-demand regime, (1+L) factor applied by backend). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the current elevated demand while the large in-transit quantity limits additional ordering; using recent windows avoids diluting forecasts with the low-demand spring regime and adapts to observed reductions in lead time.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has rebounded from the very low spring trough; last 7 concluded demands (P16-P22) average \u224879 units/week. Several early orders (notably P1) appear lost but more recent arrivals show actual lead times of 2,1,1 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=304 (large pipeline). I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures recent 2,1,1 pattern). For demand I use 'recent_N' with N=7 (uses P16-P22 mean \u224879 over the review+lead period) to reflect the current higher regime and avoid dilution by very old low-Jan samples. For sigma_hat I use 'recent_N' N=7 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices aim to provision for current elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to single arrivals or early lost shipments, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Historical concluded lead times observed = {P4: order P2 \u2192 LT=2, P17: order P16 \u2192 LT=1, P19: order P18 \u2192 LT=1} (avg \u22481.33). Multiple early orders (notably P1) never concluded \u2192 lost. Demand regime rose since P8; recent demand (Periods 18-23 = 50,68,53,82,54,52) averages \u224859.8. To reflect observed faster-than-promised arrivals on average but variability in lead times, set L by calculating the average observed lead time. For demand forecast and volatility focus on the post-change regime using recent samples (N=6) to capture current demand level and variability, reducing risk of overstock from stale January samples. These parameters balance service (capture recent higher demand) versus holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than all-time mean.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Recent concluded arrivals show lead times = {P4:2, P17:1, P19:1} \u2192 recent average \u22481.33; some early orders never concluded (possible lost shipments) so rely on most recent observed lead times. Demand in Periods 16\u201324 = [153,93,50,68,53,82,54,52,43] (9 samples) reflects current regime with higher mean and volatility vs initial Jan data. Choose L from recent 3 observed lead times to capture current supplier speed; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 9 demand samples to reflect current demand regime and higher variance. These choices help the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances service (using recent faster lead times) against holding cost given profit=holding so target service quantile is 0.5.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = 82,54,52,43,33; avg\u224852.8) is materially lower than the mid-year spike (Periods 8-15). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4), 1 (P17), 1 (P19) \u2192 use averaged estimate. On-hand=0, in-transit=304 (covers several future periods); earlier Period 1 order never concluded \u2192 likely lost but current pipeline is large. Set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecasts on the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) so the base-stock reflects current lower demand and avoids excess holding cost given holding=profit. This balances service level while limiting holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent observed lead times = [2,1,1] (arrivals in P4, P17, P19), so I use a short recent average to reflect faster arrivals lately. On-hand=0, in-transit=304 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrival timings uncertain (earlier P1 order remains unarrived per history). Demand has stabilized in the past several weeks (~33\u201382); I use recent demand (last 7 weeks) to forecast (captures current regime ~50 units/week). Choices: L recent_N(3) to weight recent observed lead times; mu_hat recent_N(7) to target (1+L)-period demand under current regime; sigma_hat recent_N(7) to reflect recent volatility. These settings balance service (using recent faster lead times and recent demand) while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Historical concluded lead times: observed 2 (P4), 1 (P17), 1 (P19) \u2192 evidence actual lead time shorter than promised on average but variable; several early orders never concluded (likely lost) so be conservative and let backend infer average. Demand regime: earlier large drop then rebound around Periods 8+; recent weeks (P16-P27) show higher, variable demand but no new sustained regime change. I select L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect realized performance; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample statistics scaled by 1+L) so the OR backend applies its base-stock formula with the inferred lead time while keeping demand estimation broad given variability and potential lost shipments.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been moderate but higher than the early low-regime (recent weeks ~30-80/week). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=304 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand, so avoid inflating demand forecast. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4 arrival from P2), 1 (P17 from P16), 1 (P19 from P18) \u2192 average lead time \u22481.33. I set L=calculate so backend uses the observed average lead time. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std using all historical samples (conservative given variable history and potential lost early shipment). This balances service level vs holding cost given current large in-transit volume.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand is low relative to Jan samples: last 6 concluded demands (P24-29) avg \u224834.5, while historical Jan mean \u2248151. On-hand=0, in-transit=304 (large pipeline; includes long-outstanding orders that previously did not conclude). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,1} \u2192 use aggregated observed lead time rather than promised to reflect faster arrivals seen recently. Set L by calculate (avg observed). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to anchor forecast and volatility to the current low-demand regime (captures most recent stable pattern); this keeps base_stock aligned to current demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent concluded lead times = {P4:2, P17:1, P19:1} \u2192 recent average \u22481.33, so I use recent_N=3 to adapt L toward ~1\u20131.5 rather than the promised 2. Demand has been in a low, stable regime since late July; last 6 observed weekly demands (Periods 25\u201330) average \u224831.2. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility. Note on-hand=0, in-transit=304 and many earlier orders were delayed/lost; using shorter inferred L and recent demand reduces excess holding while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16. Recent demand has settled around low-30s per week; last 5 demands (P27-31) = [41,33,26,19,23] (mean \u224828.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=304 (some early orders were delayed/lost historically). Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,1] so I use a recent average to reflect mixed/shorter lead times. Set L via recent_N to average the last 3 observed lead times (captures shift from 2\u21921). Forecast demand using recent_N over last 5 periods to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost. Use recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility. These choices balance service (cover near-term demand with in-transit + ordered) against high holding cost (holding=$1 equals profit=$1), keeping target inventory conservative.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent weekly demand has fallen from prior peaks; last 5 observed demands (Periods 28-32) average ~26.2 units, while on-hand=0 and in-transit=304. Observed concluded lead times = {2 (P4 from P2), 1 (P17 from P16), 1 (P19 from P18)} -> mean ~1.33. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N N=5 to anchor mu_hat to the latest low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering into high holding cost (holding = profit). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to current low demand while accounting for measured lead-time shortening and large in-transit volume to avoid excess orders.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). Recent weekly demand has been low/moderate (last 5 demands: 26,19,23,30,48 \u2192 mean \u224829.2) versus earlier 2019 winter highs. On-hand=0, in-transit=304 (large pipeline) \u2014 do not inflate forecasts. Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P16\u2192P17), 1 (P18\u2192P19); recent avg suggests ~1.33. I set L using recent lead-time evidence to reflect shorter realized lead times while being robust to variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the current lower-demand regime and reduce safety stock; this plus large in-transit inventory will keep orders conservative and limit holding cost while maintaining service. Methods chosen: L recent_N (N=3) to average last 3 observed lead times; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to use last 5 demand weeks.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=304. Historical concluded lead times: 2 (P4 from P2), 1 (P17 from P16), 1 (P19 from P18) \u2192 recent average lead_time \u22481.33. Demand shows an elevated spike around P16-17 then a lower steady regime from P17\u2013P35 (19 periods) with typical weekly demand ~20\u201350. The in-transit 304 likely includes multiple prior orders (one long-unarrived order likely lost earlier) but is the current pipeline to cover future demand. I set L using recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent observed lead-time behavior (1\u20132 periods). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=19 to forecast (1+L)-period demand from the current stable demand regime following the P16\u2013P17 spike. These choices balance service (using recent shorter lead times) against holding costs by sizing demand estimates to the current lower-demand regime rather than the early-year high values.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand regime is much lower than Jan samples (sustained lower weekly demand since Period 8). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P2\u2192P4), 1 (P16\u2192P17), 1 (P18\u2192P19) \u2192 average \u22481.33. On-hand=0, in-transit=304 (large pipeline). To reflect the shorter empirical lead time use calculate (backend will average observed lead times). For demand forecast, use recent_N over the most recent stable low-demand regime (use N=20 to capture recent 20 weeks) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean and volatility; this keeps base-stock conservative vs high Jan mean and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=304 (no arrivals observed since Period 19 conclude). Historical concluded lead times: 2 (P4 arrival from P2), then several 1-period arrivals (P17,P19). However many orders remain in-transit and have not concluded for many periods \u2192 evidence of prolonged delivery failure/longer effective lead time. Demand has been low recently; last 5 concluded weekly demands (P33-P37) average \u224834.8. To protect service given stuck pipeline, set lead time explicitly longer to force the OR engine to plan for multi-period coverage; base demand estimate uses recent 5-week average scaled by (1+L) via recent_N to reflect review+lead. Volatility estimated from same recent window.

Carry-over insight: Prolonged shipments stuck: in-transit=304 with no concluded arrivals since Period 19 \u2192 effective lead time appears significantly longer than promised or shipments lost (sustained >3 periods).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand regime is low and stable (many weeks of ~20\u201350 units vs earlier 100+). On-hand=0, in-transit=352 but many prior orders have not concluded (prolonged stuck shipments since Period 19), so actual lead time appears longer than promised. To protect service while avoiding excess holding, I set lead time explicitly longer than promised (conservative L=3). For demand I use a recent-window estimate to capture the current low regime (most recent ~19 weeks of realized demand). Sigma also uses the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the pipeline target for the longer effective lead time while basing quantity on the current lower-demand regime to balance service level and holding cost given lost/delayed shipments.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=352 (many shipments outstanding/delayed). Concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2,1,1 \u2192 average \u22481.33, so use calculate to let backend set L from observed lead times. Recent demand has been low and stable (~32\u201337 in last 6 concluded weeks), so use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime. This keeps base_stock aligned with recent demand while acknowledging outstanding pipeline; helps avoid excess holding given holding cost = profit.

I will let the backend infer an empirical lead time from concluded arrivals (use calculate) and use default demand aggregation so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full history ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to avoid overreacting to recent volatility.

Observed concluded lead times: 2, 1, 1 \u2192 use calculate to let backend average observed lead time. Demand history is noisy and seasonal; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L).

Recent demand is volatile with a large spike in Period 42 (143) during holiday timing; however the spike is not clearly sustained. To guard against unseen/transit stock issues I explicitly increase lead time. Choices: L set explicit=4 to reflect observed prolonged/blocked shipments (promised=2 but many arrivals missing for >3 periods). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=6 (last 6 demand samples) to capture the current short-term demand level/volatility including the recent spike while limiting influence of older pre-regime data. This balances service (avoid stockouts given uncertain pipeline) against holding cost by using a modestly elevated lead time and basing demand forecast on recent observations.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=352 with prolonged absence of concluded arrivals since Period 19 \u2192 evidence of significantly extended or unreliable lead times. Recent demand (Periods 38-43 = 42,37,35,14,143,10) shows high variability and a Black-Friday/holiday spike (P42=143). To protect service through an uncertain/longer effective lead time I set L explicitly longer than promised, and used a recent window (last 6 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the holiday spike and current volatility. These choices raise target inventory to cover the longer/uncertain pipeline while keeping variability-driven safety stock calibrated to recent demand, balancing profit vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Promised L=2 is unreliable; set explicit L=6 to force the OR engine to hold more pipeline cover. Demand history shows recent spikes (e.g., P42=143) but no new sustained regime shift since prior insights, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the backend compute base stock with expanded L. This reduces stockouts under prolonged delivery delays while the backend's cap limits excessive ordering and holding cost exposure.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=426 with multiple past orders not concluded -> evidence of prolonged/longer-than-promised lead times or lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 41-46): [14,143,10,35,64,68] shows recovery from very low midsummer to moderate Dec demand with a one-off spike (143). To hedge against delayed arrivals I set lead time longer than promised (explicit L=3). For demand I use recent_N=6 to capture the current post-spike regime without overweighting older winter-spring data. Sigma uses recent_N=6 to reflect current volatility. These choices increase pipeline cover for expected near-term demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability given holding cost = profit (q=0.5).
