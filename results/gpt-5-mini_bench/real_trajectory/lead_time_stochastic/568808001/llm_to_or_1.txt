Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward run across the five available samples (23,29,31,38,50), so I bias the demand forecast toward the most recent regime by using recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat. No concluded arrivals exist, so I cannot infer actual lead time\u2014use promised lead time (default). Volatility will use the default estimator (all samples) to let the backend scale \u03c3\u0302 by \u221a(1+L). This balances higher expected demand with the default uncertainty and the backend's capped ordering rule to avoid extreme overordering given holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand samples (23,29,31,38,50) give mean ~34.2; Period 1 demand=36 (no sustained shift). On-hand=0, in-transit=52 (order from P1 not yet concluded \u2014 consistent with promised lead time=2). No evidence of lost shipment or lead-time change. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand estimates so OR backend computes base stock and caps using full sample mean/variance.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent realized demand: Period1=36, Period2=60; historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show moderate upward trend (23,29,31,38,50). On-hand=0, in-transit=102 (orders from P1\u2013P2 not yet concluded). Promised lead time is 2; however we have only two consecutive non-arrivals and cannot conclusively infer a lead-time shift or lost shipments. To be conservative and compatible with the OR backend, use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock from all samples. This balances service level (captures recent higher demand via historical samples) while avoiding overreacting to incomplete arrival signals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=151 (orders placed P1-P3). No arrivals have concluded for orders placed in Periods 1-3, so promised L=2 appears violated. To protect service given likely longer lead time, set L explicit=3 (conservative). Demand recent three concluded periods = [36,60,37] showing elevated mean vs historical baseline; use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat to cover review+lead (1+L=4) periods of expected demand. Use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters increase target base stock to balance profit vs holding cost while accounting for delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time likely >=3 periods: orders placed P1(52), P2(50), P3(49) had arrived=0 by Period 3 conclude.

Daily Profit: $950.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $950.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows one order (P2) with actual lead_time=2; P1 and P3 previously had delayed arrivals but P4 conclude provided arrival evidence consistent with promised lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=168 (covers multiple outstanding orders). Historical weekly demand mean from samples \u224834.2. No sustained demand regime shift detected (only 5 historical samples, last sample 50 consistent with rising trend but not sustained for 3+ periods). Therefore use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set; this balances service level (q high because profit >> holding) while avoiding overreaction to limited recent variability and potential lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weekly demand has been elevated vs. older samples (Period1-5 demands: 36,60,37,51,44). On-hand=0, in-transit=168 \u2014 pipeline currently provides coverage but arrivals have been irregular historically. Concluded history shows one confirmed lead time = 2 (Period2 order arrived in Period4) and multiple earlier non-arrivals; therefore use calculated lead time based on observed lead times. To reflect the recent higher demand regime, set demand estimate using the most recent 5 periods (captures current level and variance). Sigma also estimated from the same recent 5 samples so the OR backend can size safety stock to balance $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: order on Period 2 arrived on Period 4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent demand is higher than the older 2019-Jan samples (recent demands: P1-6 = 36,60,37,51,44,54; mean\u224847). On-hand=0, in-transit=168 (covers multiple periods). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 periods in history, so use promised/confirmed lead time. To reflect the sustained higher recent demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 6 samples (captures the new regime). This increases the base stock to improve service while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility; L left at default to match observed lead time and OR backend assumptions.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=169. Historical demand samples (seed): [23,29,31,38,50], mean=34.2. Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 2 (order on P2 arrived on P4). No sustained demand regime change detected. Use promised/default lead time to align with confirmed observation and let OR backend compute base_stock from full-sample mean. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio and current large pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has been high and volatile (periods 1-8 demands: 36,60,37,51,44,54,49,68). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 168 (large pipeline). Lead-time observations: one order (P2\u2192P4) showed lead_time=2, one order (P7\u2192P8) showed lead_time=1; other early orders never concluded. Because observed lead times vary, use the calculated average lead time to let the backend reconcile observed LT variability. Pipeline is already large (168) so avoid aggressive upward demand inflation; use default demand and volatility aggregation so the OR engine applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This balances service level (by using observed average LT) with holding cost (by relying on existing large pipeline and aggregate demand statistics).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent observed weekly demand is elevated vs. Jan samples: last 5 demands (Periods 5-9) = [44,54,49,68,39], mean=50.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=169 (sizable pipeline). Prior concluded lead-time evidence includes a confirmed 2-period arrival (Period 2\u21924); promised lead time is 2, so use default for L. To capture the recent higher demand regime while letting the OR backend combine with lead time, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 5 samples (1+L multiplies the recent mean) and set sigma_hat from the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This balances service (higher base stock for elevated demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): on-hand=0, in-transit=184. Recent concluded lead times: orders (P2->P4)=2, (P7->P8)=1, (P9->P10)=1 \u2014 recent average ~1.33. Recent demand (Periods 6-10) shows a higher regime vs Jan samples (demands: 54,49,68,39,41; mean=50.2). Given the mixed but mostly 1-period observations and a non-negligible 2-period observation, I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the short but variable lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent mean across the review+lead horizon. Sigma is set recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend builds base_stock around the recent elevated mean while recognizing slightly >1 average lead time; the large in-transit (184) will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing final orders, avoiding unnecessary new purchases while maintaining service against recent demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead-times (observed 2,1,1) so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand (Periods 4-11) is higher than the early Jan samples and appears to represent the current regime; use a recent-N demand estimate to capture current mean and volatility. Chosen parameters: L by calculate to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 8 demand observations; sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting current higher demand while letting the OR engine apply its service-level cap to balance holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=184. Concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: observed lead_times = {P2->P4:2, P7->P8:1, P9->P10:1} (recent 3 observed LT avg=1.33). Pipeline is large (184) but on-hand is zero, so keep lead-time estimate slightly below promised to reflect recent faster arrivals while acknowledging variability. Use L=recent_N (N=3) to capture recent observed average lead time. Demand history includes early 2019 samples and the intervening weekly demands through Period 12; no sustained regime shift in demand detected, so keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) to let OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. These settings balance service (capture recent shorter lead time) versus holding cost given large pipeline and moderate holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13): on-hand=0, in-transit=184. Recent concluded lead-time observations are mixed (observed lead_times = 2 at P4, 1 at P8, 1 at P10). Demand recent window shows stable ~39\u201350 units/week (last 5 demands mean=43.4). To balance service vs holding cost given uncertain but short lead times and strong recent demand, I use recent averages: L as recent_N (N=3) to capture the latest observed lead-time mix; mu_hat as recent_N (N=5) to reflect the last 5 weeks' demand; sigma_hat as recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This keeps ordering responsive to the most recent demand regime and lead-time behavior while the large in-transit volume will be reconciled by the OR engine.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent observed weekly demand has been high (last five weeks: 50,50,50,61,50+ earlier spikes) and on-hand is 0 but in-transit=184 units. Historical concluded lead times show mixed values (1\u20132 periods) with an earlier confirmation of 2-period lead time; no new sustained lead-time shift is evident. To let the OR backend use its promised-lead-time model and full historical demand sample, I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages all data while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate ordering urgency and keeps holding cost exposure controlled.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has risen (last five demands: 37,50,50,61,76) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=184 units. Recent concluded lead-time observations are mixed (observed lead times: 2,1,1); use an averaged estimate for L to let OR backend size pipeline appropriately. I select L=calculate so backend averages observed lead times. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (captures the latest upward regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 5 samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices prioritize meeting elevated recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind by using a short recent window rather than all-history smoothing.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=206. History shows mixed arrival delays but Period 6 evidence confirmed a 2-period lead time (order P2\u2192arrived P4) and there are additional observed lead times of 1 period for other small orders. I therefore let the backend compute an empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method='calculate'). Demand history (seed samples 23,29,31,38,50) is limited; I use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) consistent with chosen L. This balances service level against holding cost while letting the backend incorporate the inferred L into the base-stock calculation. No explicit adjustments despite large in-transit because some earlier orders were delayed/lost; using calculate+default lets backend adapt using observed lead times and full sample statistics.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=0, in-transit=184. Recent concluded arrivals show most observed lead times = 1 (orders P7->P8, P9->P10, P16->P17) despite an early P2->P4 = 2; pipeline is large so use a shorter inferred L to avoid overstock. I set L to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the last three observed lead-times averaging ~1. Demand has grown through spring (recent weeks 50\u201379); to emphasize recent high demand while smoothing noise I use EWMA_gamma with gamma=0.3 for mu_hat. Volatility should reflect recent variability, so sigma_hat uses recent_N over the last 8 demand samples. These choices bias the OR backend toward higher target stock to meet strong recent demand while keeping tail risk controlled given the large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 1 period (observed: order on Period 7 arrived Period 8; P9->P10; P16->P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time settled at 1 period (evidence: P7->P8, P9->P10, P16->P17). On-hand=0, in-transit=282 (pipeline large). Demand has shifted upward recently (last 5 demands: P14-P18 = 61,76,79,78,82; mean ~75.2). To reflect confirmed shorter lead time and the recent high-demand regime, I set L using recent observed lead times (short window) and set demand mean/volatility using the last 5 periods to capture the elevated demand while keeping responsiveness to further shifts. These parameters reduce overstating lead time risk (avoiding excessive pipeline) and raise the base stock to cover the elevated demand over the review+lead period.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Current on-hand=31, in-transit=184 (total pipeline=215) which comfortably covers several weeks of recent high summer demand. Historical concluded lead times show a shift from occasional 2\u2192 predominantly 1 period (recent sequence of 1,1,1). I set L via recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent confirmed lead-time regime (average \u22481). Demand has clearly shifted upward since early samples (spring\u2192summer); to capture the current summer demand level I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent demand regime (N=12) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant recent samples. These parameters prioritize service (higher mu_hat) while pipeline already large reduces urgent ordering; using recent statistics avoids being pulled by low historical winter values.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=199 \u2014 large pipeline covering multiple weeks. To reflect the observed shorter lead time vs promised and to emphasize recent demand regime (high 50s\u201380s), I set L via calculate (use observed lead times), and base demand estimates on recent history: use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock tuned to the last 10 periods of demand. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit stock and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent conclude history shows lead-times have converged to 1 period (multiple observations: P7->P8, P9->P10, P16->P17, P18->P19). Demand has stepped up recently with large weekly variability and a big spike in Period 21 (d=137). To capture the now-shorter lead time and the recent higher/variable demand I set L using a recent average of observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand periods to reflect the current regime and volatility. This biases orders toward meeting the recent elevated demand while keeping safety stock sized to recent variability.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=330. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times: observed W = {P2->P4:2, P7->P8:1, P9->P10:1, P16->P17:1, P18->P19:1, P20->P22:2} \u2192 average \u22481.33. Demand has risen materially since May (periods 14\u201322 show consistently higher weekly demand vs earlier periods); I detect a recent high-demand regime spanning the last 9 concluded demand observations (periods 14\u201322). To reflect the empirical lead-time mix I let the backend compute an averaged lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate). For demand I use recent_N over the last 9 samples to capture the upward regime for mu_hat and similarly recent_N for sigma_hat so the OR engine upsizes base stock and uncertainty to cover the sustained higher demand while the backend's capped order will limit extreme orders given the pipeline of 330 units. This balances higher service needs against holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=46, in-transit=222 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to demand, so we avoid inflating targets. Recent concluded history shows mixed lead-time evidence (some 1-period, some 2-period observations) but no new sustained change since prior insights. Use default (promised) lead time to keep OR backend assumptions aligned with supplier promise and avoid overreacting to intermittent arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the historical samples) so the base-stock balances profit vs holding cost without adding extra safety stock given heavy pipeline. This minimizes holding cost while preserving service level implied by profit/(profit+holding) tradeoff.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=222. Recent concluded lead-times show a persistent shift to ~1 period (multiple P16->P17, P18->P19, P22->P23 arrivals) though occasional 2s occur. Pipeline (222) is large vs typical weekly demand but arrival timing uncertainty remains. I set L using recent_N to let backend average the most recent observed lead-times (captures current ~1-period regime). I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent weeks (captures summer demand spike) so the OR engine computes a base-stock aligned to current demand and reduced lead-time risk. This balances higher service level for elevated summer demand while avoiding excess holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=349 (large pipeline). Recent concluded arrivals since Period 18 consistently show 1-period lead times (P7->8, P9->10, P16->17, P18->19, P22->23), so I use a short recent average. Demand has risen in late spring/early summer (Jun\u2013Jul) with several large weeks (78,82,67,80,137,93,79); I bias forecasts toward the recent high-demand regime by using recent samples. Chosen methods: L=recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed short lead-time behavior; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations, which reflect the summer spike and reduce dilution from early low-winter samples. This keeps base stock responsive to elevated demand while the large in-transit quantity limits immediate ordering aggressiveness.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=349 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead-time observations show sustained short lead-times (many 1-period arrivals in periods 16-23), so I use a recent average to capture the current shorter lead-time regime. Demand has shifted up vs. the Jan-Feb seed samples (recent weeks show means ~70-90 with high variance); to reflect the current regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, so the OR backend will size base-stock for the (1+L) review+lead horizon using recent realized demand rather than stale early-year samples. Using recent_N for sigma captures current variability and prevents understocking. Given the large in-transit volume, this configuration trusts pipeline but uses up-to-date demand stats to avoid excessive future holding while keeping service high.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time has been consistently 1 period for many recent orders (e.g., P16->P17, P18->P19, P22->P23); use calculated average lead time to capture recent evidence. On-hand=0, in-transit=349 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed until their conclude; set demand forecast to a recent-window average to reflect the summer higher demand (last 5 concluded demands: P24\u2013P28 = 47,79,62,89,80) so the OR backend builds base stock for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the elevated, variable summer demand while limiting influence of early-year low-demand weeks.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. Recent concluded arrivals show lead times clustered at 1 with occasional 2s; demand in recent weeks (Periods 22-29) is elevated and more variable versus early-sample period. To be responsive to the recent higher demand regime I set lead time using a short recent-average and base demand/volatility on recent samples so the OR engine raises base stock and cap to avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=349. Historical concluded lead times show mixed values but recent confirmed pattern: multiple 1-period arrivals after Period 18. I choose L by averaging observed lead times (method=calculate) so the backend infers a short actual lead time while still using all evidence. Demand has shifted upward in late spring/summer (sustained higher weekly demand across many recent periods); to capture the recent regime I use recent_N with N=16 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases base-stock on the most recent demand behavior and variability. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost by restricting the sample window to the recent high-demand regime rather than older low-demand weeks.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=349. Recent weekly demand has been high (late summer): last 8 observed demands = [47,79,62,89,80,59,81,90] (mean ~73.4). Lead-time observations in concluded history show mostly 1-period arrivals recently but some 2-periods earlier; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the recent high-demand summer regime so orders reflect current demand rather than older low-demand samples. This keeps base-stock tuned to recent demand spikes while L calculated from observed lead times reconciles earlier variability.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand (Periods 26-32) has been high and volatile (weekly demands ~62-90). On-hand=0, in-transit=349 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers multiple weeks but earlier history shows variable lead times and occasional lost/delayed shipments; however recent concluded arrivals indicate a shorter lead time (mostly 1). I choose L as recent_N to reflect recent observed lead-times. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to focus the forecast on the latest high-demand regime so base_stock covers (1+L) review+lead demand. Sigma is recent_N (N=7) to capture recent volatility and produce appropriate safety stock. These settings balance service level (avoid stockouts during sustained high demand) against holding cost given a large pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=349. Historical concluded arrivals show lead-time variability but recent concluded evidence (Periods 17\u201323) centers at ~1 period with occasional 2s; no new concludes after Period 23. Many past orders went missing/delayed but in-transit balance is large (349) so we should treat lead time as the recent observed regime, and base demand forecast on the recent high-demand regime since demand has meaningfully increased since mid-June. Therefore: L set via recent_N to capture the most recent observed lead-time behavior (stabilized around 1); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (last 16 demand samples from the regime starting around Period 18) so the base stock reflects higher demand and the OR cap respects variability. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts while large pipeline is expected) while keeping holding cost in check by using recent volatility.

I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the observed average lead time from concluded arrivals. Given substantial in-transit stock and no clear recent demand regime shift beyond historical samples, I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples and balances service level vs holding cost using the profit/holding ratio.

Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 90,70,129,75,45; avg\u224881.8), so use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the current regime. Promised lead time remains 2 (use default) because concluded lead-time evidence is mixed historically and the backend expects promised L; using recent_N for mu and sigma will let the OR engine size orders to current demand while relying on the backend's lead-time assumption. This balances service (capture current higher demand) vs. holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Historical concluded lead-times show mostly 1\u20132 periods with occasional 2+ early; use calculated average lead time to reflect observed mix. Demand history available; use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. These choices let the OR engine size base-stock to account for the inferred average lead time while relying on full-sample demand stats to balance service level vs holding cost given the large in-transit position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=349 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show mostly 1 period recently with occasional 2s; using overall observed average for L to let backend blend past variability. Recent demand shows a new regime with higher and variable weekly demand (last 7 periods = 90,70,129,75,45,44,42); use recent 7-sample mean and std (scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) by backend) so mu_hat/sigma_hat reflect the latest demand pattern while the large pipeline reduces aggressive ordering. These parameters balance service (capture recent higher mean) against holding cost given heavy in-transit stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=349 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead times (most recent 5 observed) = [2,1,2,1,1] => average ~1.4, so use recent_N to let backend average recent realized lead times. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P34-P38) = [75,45,44,42,48], showing mean ~50.8 and moderate variability; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the most recent regime. These choices (recent_N for L, mu_hat, sigma_hat with N=5) adapt to the confirmed recent shorter lead times and recent demand level while letting the OR backend compute safety stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff. Large in-transit reduces immediate ordering urgency; recent_N approach prevents over-ordering if demand has softened.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=349 \u2014 large pipeline exists though many past shipments were delayed/variable. Recent concluded lead-times show a mix of 1\u20132 periods; use observed-average lead time to let backend adapt. Demand history is noisy with many stockouts; use default demand/volatility aggregation so OR engine uses all samples for baseline (avoids overfitting to recent censored zeros). This balances service (use observed average L) vs holding cost by relying on centralized base-stock computation and capped ordering.

Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=349. Historical conclude messages (multiple arrivals after Period 18) consistently show actual lead time = 1 period in the recent regime, so I set lead time explicitly to 1 to reflect observed reality. Use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample history; this balances service level (captures recent faster lead time) while letting the backend apply its z* cap given profit/holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent weekly demand (Periods 31-41) has settled lower (~40\u201390 earlier but last 11 weeks \u224840\u201348) after summer peaks; on-hand=0, in-transit=349 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show a sustained shift to 1 period since Period 18 (multiple confirms). To avoid over-reacting to earlier volatile summer demand while matching the recent lower demand regime and confirmed shorter lead time, I set L using recent observed lead times, and set demand and volatility using recent demand samples (capture current regime). This leverages the high in-transit (349) so backend caps will limit orders; using recent_N keeps base_stock aligned with current mean and variance, reducing holding cost exposure given holding=$1/unit.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=349. Recent demand shows a one-off spike (Period 42=115) but the last 5 weeks average is elevated vs long-run. Use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting given mixed historical lead-time signals. Set mu_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples to respond to the recent uptick while sigma_hat stays default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (capture recent demand rise) against holding cost given large in-transit position.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=349. Historical concluded lead times have varied (1\u20133) but promised lead time is 2; recent concluded messages show many 1\u20132 period arrivals. Given large in-transit pipeline that likely covers multiple weeks and to avoid overreacting to intermittent late/early arrivals, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies the established (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations. This is conservative: it prevents placing extra orders while 349 units are still in transit and lets the OR engine cap new orders appropriately.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times vary (observed W={2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1} => mean\u22481.375), so I use calculate for L to let backend infer average actual lead time from concluded history. Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so demand forecast uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and volatility by sqrt(1+L). Given large in-transit inventory (349), this conservative approach avoids inflating forecast or safety stock further while letting the OR engine cap orders appropriately.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=349 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand, so avoid inflating forecasts. Concluded arrivals since early periods show most observed lead times = 1 (several P7->P8, P9->P10, P16->P17, P18->P19 etc.), so let backend compute the average observed lead time from concluded history (method=calculate). Use default demand/volatility rules ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine uses full historical sample base; this keeps mu_hat conservative given the large in-transit stock and penalizes excess holding via the backend's q tradeoff (profit=19 vs holding=1). If shipments are lost/delayed later, we will record a carry-over insight and switch to explicit L.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded lead times show a mix but recent evidence leans toward ~1\u20132 periods (samples: 2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1 \u2192 avg 1.375). To reflect recent realized lead-time behavior while keeping OR aware of variability, set L via recent_N using the last 8 observed lead-time samples. Use default demand/volatility calculations so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples given limited reliable regime shifts; this balances service level (capture pipeline + demand) versus holding cost given high in-transit inventory.
