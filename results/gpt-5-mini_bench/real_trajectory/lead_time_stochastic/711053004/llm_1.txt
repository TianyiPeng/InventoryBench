Casual T-shirt SKU can see modest pre-holiday uplift but primary signal is historical trend. b) Demand regime: Historical weekly sales show a clear sustained upward trend over 5 weeks: 2019-01-07=6, 01-14=13, 01-21=32, 01-28=49, 02-04=62. This is a significant increasing regime (demand rising each week). c) Lead time / orders: On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time; supplier promised LT=2. Assume promised LT until contradicted. d) Inventory & pipeline: With LT=2, current order placed now must cover demand for current period (after decision) plus the next 2 periods (L+1=3 periods) before any arrival. No inventory or in-transit stock exists, so we must order to cover ~3 periods of expected demand. e) Order logic: Using recent trend (last observed week=62, trend pointing upward) and small holding cost ($1) versus high profit ($19), target coverage ~3 periods at a conservative elevated weekly forecast ~65\u201375 units. I choose to order 200 units to provide coverage for rising demand and a small safety buffer while accepting modest holding cost.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 46 = 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas). Apparel can see holiday uplift, but historical recent weekly demand is low (Periods 41\u201345 = 32,27,12,12,20; avg \u224820). Demand regime: recent realized demand ~20/week, far below earlier peaks. Lead time & pipeline: In-transit=820 equals outstanding orders P1(200)+P3(50)+P19(420)+P38(150)=820; these never concluded. History shows highly variable actual lead times (observed =1,2,3) and multiple long-missing shipments \u2192 pipeline unreliable and some shipments likely lost. Inventory assessment: on-hand=0 and large unreliable pipeline of 820 units; holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit. Ordering decision logic: given low recent demand, holiday uncertainty, large in-transit volume (likely to deliver some time) and unreliable supplier, adding new inventory risks extra holding cost while incremental sales per unit ($19) do not justify accumulating more stock now. Conservative choice: place no new order this period.",

======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (year-end/New Year). Historically December weeks for this SKU show low demand (Periods 41\u201346: 32,27,12,12,20,16) so no material holiday uplift expected. Demand regime: recent regime since Period 33 is lower demand (avg \u224844 and more recent weeks \u224812\u201332), consistent with Dec low sales. Lead-time / pipeline: In-transit = 820 units (large) and history shows variable/delayed arrivals (multiple past orders arrived with lead_time 1\u20133 or remained delayed). Treat the current in-transit pipeline as unreliable but substantial. Inventory & holding: On-hand = 0 but in-transit 820 will likely arrive over coming periods causing heavy holding cost ($1/unit/period) if not sold quickly. Economic tradeoff: Profit per unit = $19 >> holding $1, so selling is valuable, but current expected weekly demand is low and pipeline is large \u2014 ordering more risks increasing holding cost without matching demand. Action: do not place new orders and let pipeline fulfill demand; monitor actual arrivals to update lead-time inference.",
