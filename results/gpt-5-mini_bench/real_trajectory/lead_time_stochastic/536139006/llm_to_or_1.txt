Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for current + lead periods. No concluded arrivals to infer lead-time deviations. Use promised lead time (default) L=2. Historical weekly samples (134,130,128,144,126) show mean=132.4; use default mu_hat to set (1+L)\xd7mean = 3\xd7132.4 (backend will compute). No evidence of recent regime change or volatility shift, so use default sigma_hat. This balances service (covering review+lead demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent weekly demand samples avg ~132.4 units; on-hand=0, in-transit=145 units (ordered in Period 1, arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude). Promised lead time is 2 and we have only one conclude showing no arrivals yet, so no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipment. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend applies the historical mean-based base stock while respecting the promised lead time and current pipeline. This balances service (covering 3 periods of expected demand) versus holding cost given limited evidence of regime change.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 132.4 units/week (samples: 134,130,128,144,126). Promised lead time = 2 periods. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 305 (orders from P1/P2), which is below (1+L)*mean = 3*132.4 \u2248 397 units needed to cover review+lead demand; however arrivals placed in P1/P2 may still be in transit and will only conclude when they actually arrive. No concluded arrivals exist to infer a lead-time change or lost shipments, so retain promised lead time and use full-sample default demand estimates so the OR backend can compute base stock and capped order accordingly.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=425. Three consecutive conclude messages show zero arrivals (orders placed P1,P2,P3) despite promised L=2, indicating shipments are delayed or lead time is longer than promised. To avoid stockouts while shipments are unreliable, set L explicitly to 3 to inflate the (1+L) demand horizon used by the OR engine. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples (2019 weekly samples mean\u2248132.4) \u2014 this increases target base-stock and safety stock to cover the longer effective pipeline. This balances higher service level (avoid lost sales) against modest holding cost (H=$1) given profit=$19.

Carry-over insight: Lead time appears >2: orders placed on Periods 1\u20133 have not arrived by Period 3 conclude (expected P1 arrival by P3), suggesting effective lead time \u22653.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1800.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent weekly demand samples (historical mean ~132) and game history show on-hand=62, in-transit=386. Orders from early periods have been delayed (P1 and P3 still not concluded), so effective lead time appears longer than the promised 2. To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost, I set L explicitly to 3 (conservative estimate given delayed arrivals). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which scales safety stock for the longer lead time and balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=473. Recent realized demands (Periods1-5): 82,110,84,98,101 (mean=95). Arrivals are inconsistent: one concluded arrival shows lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4) but several earlier orders delayed/absent\u2014so use observed lead-time average rather than promised to let backend adapt. Set L via calculate (avg observed lead times). For demand forecast use recent_N=5 (captures the most recent regime with mean\u224895) and sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent variability. These parameters aim to cover (1+L) periods of recent demand to balance service-level (profit high relative to holding cost) while avoiding excess inventory given in-transit volume and uncertain arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=386; recent arrivals have been inconsistent (observed lead_times: 2 for P2->P4, 1 for P5->P6) and earlier delays suggested possible longer effective lead time. To be conservative versus stockouts given zero on-hand and large pipeline with uncertain arrival timing, set lead time explicitly to 3 to cover longer delays. Use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and scaled std) so forecasts remain grounded in historical weekly samples while the explicit L protects against late arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized demand (Periods 1\u20137) averages ~94 units/week with volatility around recent samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=519 (sizable pipeline). Lead-time observations are mixed (observed W=2 for P2\u2192P4 and W=1 for P5\u2192P6); use the empirical average lead time to let backend reconcile promised vs observed. Use recent_N=7 for demand parameters to reflect the current post-Feb demand regime (7 most recent periods available). These settings balance service (capture recent mean\xd7(1+L)) while relying on pipeline to avoid over-ordering given high in-transit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent demand has been ~100\u2013120/wk (history shows demands 82\u2013117; historical sample mean ~132 from provided 2019-Jan samples). Current inventory: on-hand=16, in-transit=386 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: P4 evidence 2, P6 1, P8 1 => short but variable; use a recent average to reflect recent 1\u20132 period behavior. I select L as recent_N (N=3) to average the last three observed lead times (captures the two recent 1-period arrivals and the earlier 2). For demand forecast I use default so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) leveraging full sample history; sigma_hat default to let backend scale variance by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (profit per unit $19 vs holding $1) with the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering while accounting for mildly reduced lead time vs promised.

Historical weekly demand samples mean=132.4. I choose L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect recent variability (method: calculate).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=387. Recent realized demand (Periods 6-10) averages ~95.6/week and variability appears stable. Several prior orders exceeded promised LT=2 or never concluded (evidence of delayed/lost shipments); use a conservative lead time of 3 to cover observed delays. Set mu_hat using recent 5 periods to reflect the current ~95.6 weekly demand and scale for review+lead (1+L). Match sigma_hat to recent 5 periods to capture current volatility. These choices raise target base stock to protect service given delayed arrivals while using recent data to avoid overstocking from older higher-seasonal samples.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times: observed lead times = {2 (P2->P4), 1 (P5->P6), 1 (P7->P8)}; several earlier orders remain undelivered (in-transit=431) indicating some shipments delayed or pending. Historical demand samples (provided) have mean \u2248132.4 units/week and no clear sustained demand regime shift. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 high critical ratio), use calculated average lead time from observed arrivals so the OR backend accounts for actual variability, and use default demand/volatility (all samples) to leverage full history given no confirmed demand change. This keeps base-stock responsive to realized lead-time behaviour while avoiding overreacting to limited short-term noise.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical demand samples (Jan) mean=132.4; recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed arrival records: P4: order P2 lead_time=2; P6: order P5 lead_time=1; P8: order P7 lead_time=1). I choose L by averaging observed lead times to capture variability; use default demand and volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This balances service (capture slightly >1 period effective lead) vs holding cost given modest holding penalty ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Carry-over insight: Lead time estimated from concluded arrivals: observed lead_times = {2 (P4),1 (P6),1 (P8)} -> average \u22481.33 periods (sustained over 3 observed arrivals).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=387 (large pipeline). Recent concluded lead times show shorting from promised 2 \u2192 observed series includes {2,1,1,2} with recent stable short lead behavior; use recent_N for L to capture this. Demand has shifted lower vs. earlier 2019 samples; use recent 5 periods (P10\u2013P14 demands = 77,64,98,73,83) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand based on the latest regime. This balances service (use recent lead-time estimate to avoid over-ordering despite big in-transit) and holding cost (recent demand lower, so we reduce forecasted replenishment).

Promised L=2 but concluded history implies shorter actual lead time; use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand history mean\u2248132.4; using default mu_hat/sigma_hat lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the chosen L, which balances service level vs holding cost given large in-transit stock and moderate holding cost. This approach avoids overreacting to temporary gaps while reflecting realized lead-time evidence.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=387 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead_times show variability (1\u20132) with recent average ~1.33; to let backend infer a stable estimate from observed concluded arrivals I select 'calculate' for L. Demand history (samples mean \u2248132.4) supports using default (1+L)\xd7mean for mu_hat and default volatility scaling for sigma_hat. These choices let the OR engine compute a base-stock appropriate for the inferred lead time while the large in-transit quantity prevents aggressive ordering and limits holding cost exposure.

Given variable but on-average shorter-than-promised lead-time evidence, let backend compute a smoothed L from observed lead times (calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples; this leverages historical weekly demand (Jan\u2013Feb samples) while letting the OR engine cap orders given current pipeline. This approach avoids over-ordering despite a large in-transit quantity and accommodates lead-time variability inferred from concluded arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=387 (ample pipeline but arrivals are observed with delay and past shipments showed variable lead times). Historical concluded lead times available (multiple observed arrivals) justify using the empirical average rather than the promised value. Demand historical samples (Jan 2019 weekly series) show stable weekly demand; no clear recent sustained regime shift in the last concluded periods. Therefore: set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed average lead time; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Given evidence that actual lead time is often < promised 2, but variable, I use a data-driven average lead time to let the OR engine size pipeline appropriately. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving sample-based demand forecast while letting adjusted L scale the review+lead period.

Demand has trended down since spring (many low weekly demands P9\u2013P21). To reflect observed lead-time variability I choose calculate (average of observed concluded lead times). To capture the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (covers the recent ~P9\u2013P21 period) so the OR backend will size base-stock and cap using recent realized mean/volatility rather than the early high-winter samples; this reduces risk of overstock given substantial in-transit inventory and low recent demand.

To balance service vs holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1, use inferred average lead time (calculate) so backend sets review+lead demand horizon correctly. Demand forecast and volatility use defaults to leverage full historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) since no strong, sustained demand regime shift after Period 13 is confirmed here.

Historical weekly demand samples mean = 132.4. Given variable but recent average lead time < promised 2, use calculate for L so backend estimates average observed lead time. Use default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand forecast uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use observed shorter lead time) while letting OR backend handle safety stock sizing; large in-transit is noted but not confirmed lost, so avoid explicit conservatism.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent concluded arrivals imply variable lead times (observed 2,1,1,2 \u2192 avg ~1.5) and current pipeline is large (on-hand=0, in-transit=387). Demand history (sample weeks in history) will be used for forecast scaling. To capture the empirically observed lead-time variability, set L to calculate (backend will average observed lead times). Given a large in-transit shipment already covering multiple periods, use default demand/statistics so the OR engine computes mu_hat and sigma_hat from all historical samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (using observed avg lead time) against holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=387. Historical concluded arrivals give observed lead_times = {2,1,1,2} (avg \u22481.5) so I trust observed lead-time history rather than the promised 2. Use L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand history (five samples: 134,130,128,144,126) remains the best baseline; no sustained recent demand regime change detected, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will scale by 1+L). This keeps forecast grounded in historical mean while reflecting measured lead-time via calculate, addressing earlier delayed/lost-shipment signals by letting the backend incorporate the empirical lead-time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=387 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead times show variability but recent concluded arrivals (P4,P6,P8,P13) imply average actual lead time ~1.33; use 'calculate' to let backend average all observed lead times. Recent demand (last 10 concluded weeks, Periods 18-27) averages ~44.9/week and reflects current summer demand regime lower than earlier winter peaks; use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat so (1+L)\xd7recent mean captures current demand over review+lead. Use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat so volatility matches recent regime. These choices avoid over-ordering to cover outdated higher winter demand while accounting for observed lead-time behavior and the large in-transit stock (backend cap will further limit orders).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=387 with many past orders not concluding (long delays/possible lost shipments). Historical concluded lead_times are mixed (1\u20132) but prolonged absence of arrivals suggests effective lead time > promised. I set L explicit=3 to be conservative against overdue shipments. Recent demand (Periods 24\u201328 = 32,44,58,91,82) better reflects current regime; I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices raise target pipeline to cover (L+1) periods of recent demand while avoiding understocking from unseen delays.

Several orders after P13 have not concluded but in-transit large (387) so treat promised LT=2 as uncertain; use calculated average of observed L to reflect realized performance. Set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time average; use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so forecasts use full-sample demand statistics scaled by (1+L), letting OR backend compute base-stock while capping orders. This balances service (using shorter observed LT) against holding cost given large pipeline.

I set L via recent_N (N=3) to weight the most recent 3 observed lead times (captures the 1,1,2 pattern -> ~1.33) so the OR backend reduces unnecessary pipeline cover. mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) \u2014 acceptable because the historical demand samples are limited and the large in-transit position (387) already provides cover for near-term demand.

Recent concluded lead-times (most relevant arrivals) = {2 (P4),1 (P6),1 (P8),2 (P13)} \u2192 average \u22481.5; earlier periods showed >2 but recent concluded arrivals are shorter and sustained across 4 samples, so use recent average. Use L=recent_N (N=4) to reflect measured recent lead-time. Demand history seed = provided 5-sample weekly series (Jan 2019); no clear sustained demand regime change since then, so keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively) to let backend compute forecast and uncertainty.

Recent concluded arrivals (Periods 4,6,8,13) show observed lead_times = {2,1,1,2} with average \u22481.5 but earlier temporary delays occurred; overall recent arrivals suggest actual lead time shorter than promised 2 in some periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=387 \u2014 substantial pipeline. To let the OR engine adapt to recent demand regime, I use a recent window for demand (N=20) to capture the last ~20 observed weekly demands (more representative than the small original sample). I let L be calculated from observed lead times so backend averages concluded lead times. sigma_hat uses the same recent_N window so volatility matches the demand window. These choices balance service (using recent demand & observed lead times) while avoiding overstock because substantial in-transit inventory already exists.

Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed lead_times: 2,1,1,2 -> average ~1.5); to let the backend infer persistent lead-time behavior use calculate so it averages observed lead times.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=387. Many recent periods show zero observed arrivals despite pipeline units, but concluded arrivals (Periods 4,6,8,13) give observed lead_times = {2,1,1,2} -> avg=1.5. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average observed lead time (1.5) rather than the promised 2, to account for realized faster deliveries. Demand parameters use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the forecast anchored to full historical data while the adjusted L better aligns ordering timing with observed arrivals, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent observed demand history shows weekly demands mostly in the 70\u2013170 range with several high weeks (e.g. 155,159). On-hand=0, in-transit=387 \u2014 a large pipeline exists but many earlier orders experienced variable lead times and occasional delays (some orders placed did not conclude on promised schedule). Concluded arrivals provide observed lead times {2 (P4),1 (P6),1 (P8),2 (P13)} \u2192 average \u22481.5. To let the OR engine use empirical lead-time behavior rather than promised value, I select L="calculate" so backend averages observed lead times. For demand sizing I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this leverages full historical weekly samples (including recent high-demand weeks) while letting the backend apply the capped order cap. This balances service (using observed effective lead time) against holding cost given substantial current in-transit inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=387. Historical sample mean (~132/week) suggests in-transit covers ~3 weeks but many past shipments have been delayed or lost; concluded lead-time observations are mixed. To avoid overfitting noisy/partially missing arrival history, use promised lead time and historical demand stats so the OR engine applies its calibrated safety stock. Methods chosen: L=default (trust promised LT=2), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to reflect long-run weekly demand, sigma_hat=default to let backend scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (use of in-transit coverage) versus holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=387 (large pipeline with delayed/overdue arrivals). Concluded arrivals history shows recent observed lead_times \u2248 {2,1,1,2} with the last three = {1,1,2} \u2192 avg \u22481.33; however many later periods had no arrivals (possible delays/losses). Demand has trended higher in recent weeks (most recent 5 concluded weekly demands: 114,155,159,90,120), so I use a short recent lead-time estimate to reflect the concluded arrivals while capturing elevated recent demand using recent_N=5. Choices: L set to recent_N with N=3 to reflect the most recent concluded lead-time evidence; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture elevated recent demand across review+lead period; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent demand volatility. These parameters aim to balance service (accounting for recent higher demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and uncertain arrivals.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows many zero arrivals but currently in-transit=466 and on-hand=0; promised lead time=2 but concluded arrivals have varied (observed lead_times include 2,1,1,2 across concluded arrivals). I choose to let backend use observed-average lead time calculation so L reflects realized variability, while using default demand estimates seeded by all historical weekly samples (mean from provided samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the full-sample baseline over the (1+L) review+lead window. This balances service (use calculated L) against holding cost by not overfitting short-term spikes given large in-transit stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent demand has materially increased since late Sep (several weeks with 150+ and a 355 spike on 2019/11/25). On-hand=0, in-transit=466 (large pipeline, but many past orders never concluded recently). Concluded arrivals historically give observed lead_times = {2,1,1} (avg \u22481.33) so I let backend compute average observed lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime, I use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures latest ~10 weeks including Sep\u2013Nov demand spike) so the base-stock will reflect elevated demand while sigma uses recent volatility. This balances higher service level for the current peak vs holding cost given in-transit coverage.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=589. Recent concluded lead-times = {2,1,1,2,2} (avg=1.6) so I use recent_N for L to reflect the most recent 5 observed leads. Demand has increased since mid-year (many weeks >90 and several 150+ / 300+ spikes); to capture the current higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples. This keeps orders responsive to the elevated recent demand while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering given outstanding in-transit stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=589 \u2014 large pipeline but no visible on-hand stock. Recent concluded arrivals yield observed lead_times = {2 (P4),1 (P6),1 (P8),2 (P13),2 (P43)} \u2192 average \u22481.6. Use 'calculate' for L to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the backend's baseline forecast and caps orders, while L adjusted for realized lead-time evidence helps ensure pipeline covers the review+lead horizon. Not ordering explicitly now relies on large in-transit inventory to cover demand spike risk while avoiding excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Periods 40\u201344 avg demand = 201 units (P40=120, P41=125, P42=355, P43=165, P44=240) \u2014 sustained elevated demand in late Nov/Dec.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Recent weeks show a sustained seasonal demand spike (Periods 40\u201344 avg \u2248201 units). On-hand=70, in-transit=387 provides substantial pipeline cover but late-December demand remains elevated. I keep L as promised (default=2) because concluded arrivals (P41\u2192P43, P43\u2192P45) are consistent with the promised lead time and there is not yet 3+ consecutive periods proving a different persistent lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the late-Nov/Dec elevated regime (use the 5 most recent demand samples to scale mean and volatility across review+lead), which raises the base-stock to meet seasonal demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock for higher observed variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts in peak season) against holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent history shows a mixed but overall average observed lead time ~1.67 periods (observed concluded lead_times = {2,1,1,2,2,2}). On-hand=0, in-transit=749 which already provides substantial coverage versus elevated late-Nov/Dec demand (Periods 40\u201344 avg\u2248201). I choose L='calculate' to let backend use the empirical average lead time from concluded arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'default' so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples\u2014this balances using full historical demand (including the recent seasonal spike) while the calculated L adjusts the replenishment horizon given observed lead-time behavior. This approach avoids overreacting to single-period volatility and leverages the large in-transit position to limit new orders.
