Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time drift or demand regime change. Use promised lead time and population historical samples (2019-01 weekly data) so backend computes base_stock and caps consistently. Profit and holding are equal, so no bias toward extra safety stock beyond default statistical rule.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent weekly historical demand samples: [49,47,19,15,14] (mean 28.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=58 (order placed Period 1 not yet arrived). No concluded arrivals observed yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed; follow promised lead time. Use default calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with L=promised. This keeps the policy conservative given limited evidence and an outstanding shipment while avoiding premature regime shifts.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows no arrivals yet (orders placed P1 and P2 still in-transit), so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised 2. Historical weekly demand samples (49,47,19,15,14) give mean=28.8 and moderate volatility. On-hand=0 plus in-transit=83 provides some coverage; I keep L as default (promised 2) and use default demand aggregations so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This is conservative given limited new evidence and potential delayed shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=90 (orders from P1-3: 58+25+7) and no concluded arrivals \u2014 no evidence to change promised lead time. Historical weekly mean=28.8 (2019-01 samples). Recent 3 periods show demand =21,43,79 (avg=47.67), a sustained increase vs historical. Use L=default (promised 2). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3). For sigma_hat use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep lead time assumption conservative while increasing forecast and safety for higher recent demand, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=holding so service-level tradeoff is driven by recent higher demand evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: historical avg=28.8 (2019-01 samples) -> recent avg=47.67 (Periods 1-3), +65%

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-4 = 21,43,79,39) is well above the historical Jan samples (mean 28.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=118 \u2014 pipeline appears healthy but note P1 order has not yet concluded (possible delay/loss risk). One concluded arrival shows actual observed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4), matching the promised lead time. I therefore keep L as default (promised=2) but use recent data for demand forecasting: use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the sustained higher demand regime (last 4 periods). Use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base-stock to meet the elevated short-term demand while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend cap.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand elevated vs historical (recent periods: 21,43,79,39,48) and prior carry-over noted a regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=137 (some past orders delayed but Period 4 confirmed lead_time=2). I set L using observed lead-time data (calculate) to acknowledge confirmed 2-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent regime (periods with demands 79,39,48) so mu_hat reflects current higher mean over the review+lead horizon; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect increased recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher coverage to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals while keeping holding cost in mind (backend will convert these into base-stock and cap).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=147. Concluded arrivals show variable lead times: observed lead_time=2 (P2\u2192P4) and =1 (P5\u2192P6). Demand has recently surged (Periods 4-6: 39,48,122). I set L to recent_N over the last 2 observed lead times to capture current variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (Periods 4-6) to reflect the higher recent mean and volatility; this focuses the base-stock on current elevated demand while keeping safety stock responsive to variance and the mixed lead-time evidence.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent observed demands are elevated (Periods 4-7 demand: 39,48,122,148) indicating a higher-demand regime vs historical Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=209 (large pipeline but many past orders show delayed/no arrival). Observed lead times from concluded messages: one order had lead_time=2 (P2->P4) and one had lead_time=1 (P5->P6) \u2014 short sample but suggests variability around the promised L=2. To capture the recent higher demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 demand observations (Periods 4-7) so the OR engine targets a larger base stock; to reflect lead-time variability I set L using the last 2 observed lead times (average of 2 and 1). This balances higher service-level needs against holding cost given current large in-transit volume and evidence of shipment delays/losses.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has jumped (last 3 period demands = 122, 148, 108) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=177. Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1} so I use the average to reflect mixed/variable lead time. To capture the recent elevated demand regime I set demand forecast and volatility using the last 3 observed demand periods (most relevant to current sales surge). These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid lost sales while using recent variability to limit excessive holding.

Demand has accelerated and been volatile recently (recent demands last 5 periods: 48,122,148,108,60; mean ~97). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding), I use an empiric L estimate from observed lead times and base stock computed from the recent demand regime (last 5 weeks) to capture the higher recent mean and volatility while limiting excessive cap-driven orders from older low-demand data.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/22. Recent demand has risen sharply since Period 6 (large weekly sales P6-P10). Observed concluded lead times alternate 1 and 2 periods (avg ~1.5), so use calculated average lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 6-10 mean=102.4) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. On-hand 145 + in-transit 118 = 263 units, which roughly matches (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248 2.5*102.4 = 256, so params aim to meet elevated demand while limiting extra holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 6 (Periods 6-10 avg=102.4 vs historical 2019-Jan avg=28.8; +255%).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29. On-hand=41, in-transit=163. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,2,1,2,1] (avg 1.5) so actual lead time appears between 1\u20132 periods. Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime starting Period 6; recent demands (Periods 6\u201311) = [122,148,108,60,74,104], recent avg \u2248 101. Remaining pipeline plus on-hand (204) is healthy vs near-term demand, but to balance service vs holding cost I use an L estimate based on observed lead times and recent-demand statistics for mu/sigma. Choices: L=calculate to reflect observed average lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to target the (1+L)-period demand using the most recent regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to capture recent volatility. This keeps service high for the new higher-demand regime while avoiding excessive extra stock beyond the recent pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent demand has shifted up starting Period 6 (Periods 6-12 avg \u2248110.9). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 periods; I use the empirical average to let the OR engine capture realistic pipeline timing. Set L by "calculate" (avg observed lead times = 1.5). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 6\u201312) to capture the new high-demand regime: mu_hat from recent mean across the review+lead window, sigma_hat from recent volatility (recent_N N=7). On-hand=0 and in-transit=267 \u2014 using recent demand stats prevents overstock from old low-demand baseline while matching current elevated demand and balancing $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=288. Historical demand elevated since Period 6 (regime avg ~102.4) so I base demand forecast on the recent high-demand regime. Lead times observed vary 1\u20132 periods; I use recent observed lead times to capture this. Choices: L by recent_N to reflect observed 1\u20132 period variability; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N over the last 8 demand periods (Periods 6\u201313) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and its volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed variable between 1\u20132 periods; observed lead_times (by conclude): [2,1,2,1,2,1,2] => avg=1.57 (7 observations).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 6 (Periods 6-14 much higher than 2019-Jan baseline). Current inventory: on-hand=34, in-transit=204 (pipeline sizable vs demand). Lead-time history (concluded arrivals) shows variable LT around ~1.6; use averaged observed LT. To capture recent elevated demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (last 8 demand observations) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the recent high-demand regime. L chosen as calculated average of observed lead times to reflect variable LT; mu_hat/sigma_hat use recent_N N=8 to adapt to the higher recent mean and volatility and avoid underordering. This balances service (profit and lost sales cost equal) against holding costs by letting backend compute the appropriate safety stock using updated demand mean/variance and observed lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=255 \u2014 substantial pipeline but no visible arrivals this conclude. Historical demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 6 (avg ~102.4); recent 10-period window (Periods 6\u201315) captures this regime. Observed lead times have varied 1\u20132 periods; use calculated average lead time. Choices: L='calculate' to reflect observed variable lead time; mu_hat='recent_N' with N=10 to base the replenishment target on the recent high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean); sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=10 to capture recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the higher demand while sigma reflects recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

To reflect the observed variable lead time I use recent_N for L (N=7 observations). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on last 5 demand periods) so the OR engine targets a base-stock that covers (1+L) periods of elevated demand while the sigma estimate reflects recent volatility.

Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical Jan samples mean=28.8 but a sustained demand regime shift began at Period 6 (avg ~102.4); recent periods (6-17) show elevated demand. Observed lead times vary (1\u20132); use backend-calculated average for L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the higher recent-demand regime (N=12 covers Periods 6\u201317). This increases target base_stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat captures recent volatility; using recent data mitigates understock risk from regime shift and balances holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

Observed lead times have varied around 1\u20132 (avg ~1.57). To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime while respecting lead-time uncertainty, I use calculated average lead time (backend will compute from observed concludes) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to reflect the current elevated mean and variance. This increases target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the new demand level while sigma uses recent volatility to set appropriate safety stock given profit=holding, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=204. Historical demand jumped earlier (regime shift from Jan historical to much higher post-Period 6); recent demand (last 5 periods: P15\u2013P19) averages ~89\u201390 units/week. Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20132 (avg \u22481.57). To balance service vs holding (profit=holding so critical to avoid overstock), I set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate) so backend uses realized average. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to latest weeks. For sigma I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) periods of the current high-demand regime while avoiding excess inventory given equal profit/holding costs and some in-transit stock (204 units) already en route.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 269. Historical demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning Period 6 (previously recorded). Lead times remain variable between 1\u20132 periods in concluded history. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average from concluded arrivals (captures the 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=15 (Periods 6\u201320) to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime rather than the old Jan baseline; this makes mu_hat target the (1+L)-period demand under the current regime. I match sigma_hat to recent_N N=15 to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while letting the backend compute safety stock using observed lead-time and demand stats, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=260 (provides partial cover but watch for delayed/lost arrivals). Lead time has shown stable variability between 1\u20132 periods in concluded history; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand I choose recent_N with N=17 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime from Period 6\u201322. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to reflect current volatility in the same regime. These settings increase target base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma captures variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand remains well above Jan historical levels (sustained high regime since Period 6; recent demands: P19-23 = [94,100,211,146,106]).

For demand forecast use recent_N over the last 5 periods to capture the ongoing high-demand regime without over-weighting older low-demand Jan samples. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base-stock to meet elevated demand while recognizing lead-time variability and avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has clearly shifted to a higher regime since Period 6; most recent 5 demands (Periods 20\u201324 = 100,211,146,106,103) average \u2248133. Use an L estimated from observed lead-time history so backend accounts for variable LT; use recent demand statistics (last 5 periods) to capture the current high-demand regime and set matching recent volatility. Choices balance service-level (maintain stock for strong recent demand) vs holding cost by using recent_N (responsive) rather than all-sample averages.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=400. Historical and recent demand show a sustained high-demand regime since Period 6 (multi-period demands ~100+). Observed concluded lead times have alternated 1\u20132 periods (avg ~1.57). I set L to be calculated from observed lead-time concludes to capture the true average lead time. For demand I use a recent_N (N=5) estimate to focus the base-stock on the last 5 weeks (Periods 21\u201325) where demand averaged ~130 units/week \u2014 this captures the elevated recent regime while remaining responsive. I apply recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while the calculated L accounts for the shorter-than-promised deliveries seen in concludes, reducing stockouts without excessive holding given equal profit/holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=343 (large pipeline). Recent demand has been much higher than 2019-Jan baseline (sustained high regime since Period 6). Lead times observed variable (1\u20133), so use aggregated estimate. To capture the sustained high-demand regime, set demand estimates from recent history (larger N). Chosen methods: L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the resumed high-demand regime and recent variability. This balances service (higher forecast to meet strong recent demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent history shows highly variable but mostly 1\u20132 period lead times with one 3-period outlier; on-hand=0, in-transit=338 (large pipeline). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the average of observed lead times (captures empirical ~1.7 periods). For demand sizing I use 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages the full historical sample set while the calculated L adjusts the review+lead horizon. This approach is conservative given delayed/lost shipments evidence and large pipeline: it prevents overreacting to single-period spikes while letting the OR engine raise target inventory proportional to the empirically longer lead time.

Lead time has shown variability in concluded messages (1\u20133 periods), so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility while avoiding overweighting older low-demand January samples.

LLM Rationale:

I choose L=calculate to let backend infer the average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures variable 1\u20133 period behavior). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 6+); N=20 caps the recent window per rules and balances responsiveness vs. noise. These settings direct the OR engine to target a base-stock sized to the recent high-demand mean while using the calculated lead time to account for variable arrivals and avoid excessive safety stock against lost/delayed shipments.

Historical concluded lead-times show variable 1\u20133 with an observed average ~1.57; demand has recent volatility with last 5 periods demands = [59,90,118,51,28] (mean ~69). I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history rather than the promised 2, mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the current recent demand regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples), and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Historical observed lead_times (from conclude messages) vary 1\u20133; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand has fallen from earlier summer peaks; last 5 demands (Periods 28\u201332) = [90,118,51,28,37], so I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period forecast to the latest regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Historical Jan-2019 mean=28.8 but demand has been volatile with prior regime shifts (noted in carry-over). Recent 8 periods (P28\u2013P35) show lower/variable demand (90,118,51,28,37,51,38,26) indicating current recent demand regime ~54.9/week. Many concluded arrivals show variable lead times (mix of 1\u20133); using all observed lead-time samples to estimate L. I choose: L='calculate' to use average of all observed lead times (captures variability); mu_hat='recent_N' with N=8 to forecast (1+L)-period demand based on recent 8-week mean to react to the current lower-demand regime; sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These settings balance service (use recent demand to avoid overstating needs given large in-transit inventory) and holding cost (profit=holding cost so target q=0.5; using recent estimates keeps base-stock moderate).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent observed demand has declined from summer peak; last 9 demand samples (Periods 28-36) avg ~50.8 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=338 (sizable pipeline) \u2014 cover several weeks of demand even if lead time > promised. Historical concluded lead times vary 1\u20133 but recent average ~1.57; use backend 'calculate' so it computes average observed lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (last 9 demand samples) to reflect the current lower-demand period and recent volatility, which reduces target base-stock and holding costs while preserving service for current demand. No evidence of a new sustained shift since existing carry-over insights already capture past regime/lead-time changes.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Recent 10-period demand (Periods 28-37) averages ~48.1 units/week, substantially lower than the earlier high regime (~102.4). Lead times have been variable historically (1\u20133 observed); use calculated average lead time from concluded history. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 10 samples to capture the recent lower-demand regime and lower volatility so the OR backend targets a smaller base stock and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand regime (Periods 28-37) is lower than earlier high regime; recent 10-period avg \u224848. On-hand=0, in-transit=338 (large pipeline; several periods with no arrivals suggest some shipments delayed or lost). Use L='calculate' to let backend compute average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (history shows variable 1\u20133, avg \u22481.57). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=10) to capture the lower recent regime (Periods 28-37 and into Period 38). Keep sigma_hat at default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled for (1+L); this balances service level vs holding cost given large pipeline and uncertain arrivals.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand regime is the lower level noted from Period 28 onward (~48.1 avg); on-hand=0, in-transit=338 (large pipeline). Observed lead times have been variable (1\u20133); use backend's calculate to let it infer avg observed lead time. To avoid over-ordering given a large in-transit position and recent lower demand, forecast demand using the most recent regime: use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the latest 10 periods of demand and variance. This reduces safety stock relative to long-run highs while still accounting for recent variability; using calculate for L incorporates the confirmed variable lead-time history rather than the promised value.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been low and stable: last 10 periods (P31\u2013P40) demand series = [28,37,51,38,26,18,24,17,15,11], mean=26.5, indicating a new lower regime versus earlier mid-year spikes. On-hand=0, in-transit=338 (large pipeline that will cover multiple weeks). I set L="calculate" so backend infers average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (history shows variable LT including 1\u20133 periods). For demand I use mu_hat="recent_N" with N=10 to anchor the (1+L)\xd7mean on the clear recent low-demand regime. For sigma_hat I use "recent_N" N=10 to reflect recent volatility rather than historical high-variance months. These choices down-weight earlier high spike periods, align stocking to current lower demand, and avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 31: avg(P31-40)=26.5 vs prior regime avg\u224848.1 (\u2248-45%), sustained for 10 periods

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=338. Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133) with average ~1.57; recent demand has been in the low regime since ~Period 31 (sustained ~11 periods). To reflect confirmed variable lead time I request the backend compute average observed lead time (calculate). For demand forecast I use the recent low-demand regime: recent_N with N=11 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the sustained lower mean and recent volatility, reducing overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has remained in the low regime that began around Period 31: avg demand over Periods 31-42 \u2248 24.9 units/week (12 samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=338 (large pipeline). Last confirmed lead-time evidence (through Period 26) showed variable lead_times (1\u20133) with prior estimate avg\u22481.57; no new conclude messages since, so do not change lead-time estimate. I therefore use the promised lead time (default) for L. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 31\u201342). I apply recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect current lower variability. These choices tell the OR backend to size base-stock around the current low-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline will limit new orders, balancing service level against holding cost.

Recent demand has been low and stable over the last 5 periods (P39-43 demands = 15,11,12,22,7 \u2192 recent mean \u224813.4), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 samples to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid excess stocking given high in-transit inventory.

On-hand=0, in-transit=338 which already covers several weeks of demand under current low regime; promised lead time=2. I set L to default (use promised 2). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=10 to reflect the recent low-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 10 samples \u2248 3*16) so the base-stock is sized to current demand, avoiding excess holding. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 to capture recent demand volatility rather than historical high-variance periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): on-hand=0, in-transit=338. Recent demand (Periods 31\u201345) has been a low regime (avg \u224826.5 over 15 periods). Lead times historically vary 1\u20133 with recent average ~1.57. To reflect verified variable lead time use calculated average (backend will compute from concluded history). To match the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N=15 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent 15 periods (Period 31\u201345). This keeps orders aligned to current low demand while accounting for observed lead-time variability and the large in-transit pipeline.

Historical lead times have varied 1\u20132 periods (avg\u22481.6). To be robust to observed lead-time variability while reacting to the recent low-demand regime, I set L to be estimated from observed lead-times (calculate) and use recent demand stats (last 9 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock reflecting the current low-demand regime and reduced volatility.
