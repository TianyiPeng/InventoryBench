Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (17,14,24,12,18) show stable mean ~17 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and no concluded arrivals\u2014no evidence of lead-time deviation or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population-based demand stats: default L (promised=2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level given profit/holding costs and avoids overreacting to limited history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed weekly demands (seed samples) average 17 units/week (samples: 17,14,24,12,18). Period 1 conclude shows our order of 25 has not arrived (arrived=0) but is listed in-transit=25; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Promised L=2 remains appropriate (no sustained evidence to change). Using default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean over all samples) and default volatility is appropriate given no detected demand regime change. Note: (1+L)\xd7mean = 3\xd717 = 51 expected demand over review+lead; current pipeline (25) + on-hand (0) is insufficient to cover that, so rely on OR backend base-stock calculation (which will cap orders) to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/02/25. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01) have mean = 17 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=49 (matches orders 25+24), and recent customer demands observed in conclude messages were 14 and 26 (sold=0 due to zero on-hand). Promised lead time = 2 periods and no concluded arrivals yet, so no confirmed lead-time change. Using default lead time (promised=2). Use default demand sizing so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level against holding cost: (1+L)\xd7mean (backend) targets coverage for review+lead period; defaults are conservative given pipeline (49) is slightly below the 3-period expected demand (~51).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=62. Historical weekly demand samples mean=17 (samples: 17,14,24,12,18). Orders placed in prior periods have not shown any arrivals in concluded messages, suggesting promised L=2 may be understated or shipments delayed/lost. To be conservative, set lead time explicit=3 to force the OR engine to cover a longer pipeline. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean across all samples (with L=3 this targets 4\xd717=68 units across review+lead). Use sigma_hat default so backend scales historical volatility by sqrt(1+L). This raises target base-stock to improve service given missing arrivals while balancing holding cost via the OR cap.

Carry-over insight: Possible shipment delays/losses: orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 have no concluded arrivals by Period 3 conclude (promised L=2 not observed).

Daily Profit: $44.00, Daily Holding Cost: $13.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $31.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent conclude shows Period 2 order arrived in Period 4 (lead_time=2). On-hand=13, in-transit=55. Earlier missing arrivals (Periods 1 and 3) remain in-transit/unconcluded but one concluded arrival confirms actual lead time = 2. I select L by calculating average observed lead times (evidence=single observed 2 \u2192 L=2). Demand history mean = 17/week; with L=2 the review+lead horizon is 3 weeks so use default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean (backend will compute 51). Use default sigma_hat so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. These choices align promised and observed lead time, use full-sample demand stats to avoid overreacting to limited noisy short-term variation and to balance service vs holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period 2 order arrived Period 4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4) and on-hand=1 with in-transit=55 (pipeline=56). Historical weekly demand samples mean=17 (samples: 17,14,24,12,18) so (1+L)=3 implies expected 3-period demand \u224851; pipeline slightly above that, so no aggressive uplifts needed. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR backend aligned with confirmed lead time. Use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples) to balance service level vs holding cost given current ample pipeline and modest holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=56. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). Some early periods had delayed/lost arrivals but lead time has been confirmed as 2 and not a sustained change. Using default L (promised lead time = 2) and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) keeps the OR backend aligned with its assumptions and avoids overreacting to transient missing shipments. sigma_hat default for volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized demand shows variability with a spike in Period 7 (recent demands: 12, 8, 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=56 (pipeline substantial). Promised lead time is 2 and prior conclude messages confirm L=2 (Period 2\u2192Period 4 arrival). To be responsive to the recent regime while keeping the OR backend aware of current pipeline, I use default lead time (promised L=2). For demand I focus on the most recent short-run regime using recent_N with N=3 (captures the 12,8,24 sequence) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat reflects sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std\u2014this raises target base-stock to protect service vs. the observed spike while the large in-transit reduces net ordering. This balances service-level (profit) against holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=56. Historical concluded lead times: Period2->P4 (2), Period6->P8 (2) \u2192 actual lead time confirmed as 2. Recent demand (Periods 4\u20138): 11,12,8,24,23 \u2014 evidence of modestly elevated and volatile weekly demand vs earlier Jan samples. Use recent 5-period demand to capture current regime and short memory of shifts; set L by calculated average of observed lead times (2). This balances service (capture recent higher mean) vs holding cost by letting OR compute base_stock from recent demand stats and observed L. No new sustained shipment-loss pattern beyond earlier confirmed L=2.

Historical concluded arrivals show actual observed lead times = 2 (Period2\u21924, Period6\u21928); use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given the confirmed L=2 and the sizeable in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=61 (pipeline large but recent high demand spike). Concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times (three 2s, one 1) so use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Demand has clearly increased in the most recent 4 periods (demands = 24,23,32,56) \u2014 treat as a new higher regime for forecasting, so use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture elevated mean and volatility. This increases base_stock to cover (1+L) periods of higher demand while sigma_recent raises safety stock; helps balance service level versus holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=121 which currently more than covers (1+L) periods of baseline demand. Historical concluded lead times show mainly 2-period arrivals (one 1-period observed), and earlier carry-over confirmed L=2. Recent observed demand spikes (periods 10\u201311 demand 56,95) appear episodic; baseline samples (mean=17) still appropriate as the primary forecast. To avoid overreacting to a single spike and because promised lead time=2 remains supported, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std. This keeps orders conservative given large in-transit volume and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=121. Recent concluded arrivals confirm mixed lead times (observed: 2,2,2,1) but overall average ~1.75; promised L=2. Demand has shifted sharply up in the last 3 periods (P10\u2013P12: 56,95,151) vs prior baseline (~18.4). To capture the confirmed lead-time behavior while letting the OR backend use observed averages, set L to 'calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) so mu_hat reflects the new high-demand regime (covering review+lead period). For volatility, use recent_N (N=3) to reflect elevated variance in the same recent window. These choices raise target base-stock to protect service under the new high-demand regime while using recent lead-time evidence to avoid over/under-ordering given late/lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 10-12: avg increased from 18.44 (Periods 1-9) to 100.67 (Periods 10-12), +446% ; Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: Period 2 order arrived Period 4).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). Recent history shows a confirmed lead time \u22482 and a clear demand regime shift starting Period 10 (Periods 10-12 avg rose sharply). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=241 (large pipeline arriving in future). To keep service during the new high-demand regime while avoiding excess holding, set L to be computed from observed lead times (captures occasional 1-period anomaly), and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (last 3 periods: Periods 11-13) where demand is persistently higher. This gives the OR engine up-to-date mu_hat and sigma_hat reflecting the new high mean/variance while L='calculate' allows the backend to average observed lead times. The pipeline of 241 is sufficient short-term; the chosen parameters prioritize service for the elevated demand but rely on the cap to limit overshipment and holding costs.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has stepped up sharply since Period 10 (recent demands: P10-14 = 56,95,151,111,171; avg=116.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=400 (large pipeline). Lead time has been confirmed as 2 in prior concluded messages. To capture the new high-demand regime while respecting confirmed L=2 and the backend base-stock math, I set L=default (promised 2), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the elevated mean over the last 5 periods, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This raises the target base stock to cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean while using observed recent volatility for service-level sizing; given the large in-transit volume the capped ordering will prevent excessive new orders.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has shifted sharply up starting Period 10 (demands: P10-15 = 56,95,151,111,171,122). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 417 (large pipeline). Lead-time has been consistently observed as 2 periods in concluded history. To capture the new high-demand regime I set L = default (promised 2), and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base-stock on the last 6 high-demand weeks (N=6 equals the detected recent regime length). This keeps orders responsive to the confirmed demand increase while the large in-transit quantity reduces urgency in the short run.

Observed concluded lead times are mostly 2 (with one 1); use calculated average lead time to reflect observed reality. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the new high-demand regime (periods 10\u201316) so base-stock reflects higher demand while acknowledging pipeline; this reduces stockouts given long pipeline and confirmed LT\u22482 while limiting extra holding cost compared to using all historic low-demand samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand regime jump (Periods 10-13) raised demand but subsequent periods (14-17) show continued high demand; in-transit stock is large (406) so avoid inflating forecast. Use promised lead time and default demand statistics so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling consistently while capping orders given pipeline. Choices: L=default to keep L=2 (promised, supported by concluded arrivals); mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples balancing historical and recent spikes; sigma_hat=default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Historical concluded lead times mostly 2 periods (with one 1-period outlier); use L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 10 (sustained high weekly demand through Period 18); use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecasts on the new regime (N=9 covers Periods 10\u201318). These choices (longer-look lead time average + recent-regime demand stats) let the OR engine size base-stock to satisfy elevated demand while recognizing existing large pipeline to avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (large pipeline). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 2 periods (multiple observed: P2->P4, P6->P8, P11->P13, P15->P17). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning ~Period 10 (Periods 10-19 demands: 56,95,151,111,171,122,147,171,97,211) \u2014 much higher than initial samples. To balance service (profit $4) vs holding ($1), use recent demand to capture the new higher mean/volatility while relying on promised lead time and large in-transit pipeline. I choose L=default (promised 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N to focus the estimate on the post-changepoint regime; selected N=8 to cover the most recent 8 demand periods (gives a stable recent mean and std while respecting the N selection rules). This increases orders when pipeline depletes to maintain service but lets the OR engine cap orders to avoid excessive single-period receipts given inventory already in-transit.

To capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (last 11 periods) so the backend scales base-stock and cap to current elevated mean and volatility while respecting the large in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=498. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time=2 in multiple periods (e.g., P4, P8, P10, P13, P17), and prior carry-over noted a demand regime shift (Periods 10-12) to much higher demand. In-transit stock (498) likely intended to cover the elevated demand; to keep the OR engine aligned with the confirmed lead time and recent high-demand regime I set L via calculated average of observed lead times and set demand moments using the most recent regime window. Methods chosen: L="calculate" to use observed lead times; mu_hat="recent_N" with N=12 and sigma_hat="recent_N" with N=12 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 10-21). These parameters help the OR backend size base stock to meet the new higher demand while reflecting observed lead time behavior and recent demand variability.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 10 (sustained large weekly demand vs. earlier low-demand weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are observed with lag; some past shipments were delayed but multiple concluded messages confirm many arrivals with lead_time=2. I set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (evidence: multiple conclude messages with lead_time=2 and occasional 1). For demand, I use recent_N (N=13) to capture the sustained post-Period-10 high-demand regime (Periods 11\u201323 data dominated by much larger weekly demand). Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=13) aligns volatility to the current regime. These choices raise base-stock to meet elevated demand while keeping sigma aligned to current variability so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost given the large pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 10 (large, persistent weekly demand ~100\u2013210). On-hand=0, in-transit=475 (large pipeline covering multiple weeks). Promised lead time=2 and historical conclusions frequently show 2; I keep L as default to align with promised lead time. To capture the post-changepoint higher demand, I use recent_N for mu_hat (uses the most recent regime samples) and match sigma_hat to the same recent window so variability reflects the new regime. Recent_N window chosen (N=14) spans Periods 10\u201323 (the elevated-demand regime). These parameters bias the OR backend towards higher base stock to avoid stockouts while sigma_hat from the same window keeps safety stock appropriate given increased volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 10 (weekly demand mostly 95\u2013211) and multiple confirmations that actual lead time = promised 2 periods. On-hand = 0, in-transit = 475 (large pipeline). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default) and estimate demand from the recent high-demand regime. I select recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (Periods 10\u201324, regime_length=15) so the backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; large in-transit reduces immediate order quantity but the parameters reflect elevated demand and measured volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=478. Historical concluded lead times consistently show ~2 periods (several confirmed 2s, one 1); recent concluded arrivals align with promised L=2. Significant demand increase started at Periods 10-12 and has persisted through Period 25, so use recent demand to forecast. Set L="calculate" so backend averages observed lead times (captures occasional 1 but predominately 2). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=16 (covers Periods 10\u201325 regime of elevated demand) so base stock and cap reflect the sustained higher demand while accounting for observed variability and large in-transit volume to avoid over-ordering.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (many weeks 90\u2013178 units) and historical conclude messages mostly confirm actual lead time \u22482 (several P->P+2 arrivals, one P+3 outlier). On-hand=0 but in-transit=434 (large pipeline). I will keep L at the promised/default (2) because concluded history supports L=2 and the pipeline already contains substantial inventory; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost given current high pipeline and confirmed lead time.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 2 in multiple concluded messages (Periods 4,8,10,13,17,22,27) and prior carry-over recorded a demand regime shift (Periods 10-12 onward) to much higher weekly demand. To protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand estimates focusing on recent data. I choose N=10 to capture the last ~10 weeks of the new regime (balances responsiveness vs. noise). For lead time I keep the promised/default value (2) because promises match observed concludes and the OR backend expects promised L. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat raises the base-stock to meet the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to reflect higher variability; this trades some holding cost for higher expected profit from sales given profit=$4 vs holding=$1.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=474. Historical concluded lead times are mostly 2 periods with one 3-period outlier recently; demand experienced a sustained upward regime since Period 10 with high recent weekly demand. To reflect stable recent lead-time evidence I use recent_N (N=3) for L (captures most recent observed LT sequence: 2,3,2). For demand I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the recent high-demand regime (reduces influence of low-demand early samples) so the backend sets a higher base stock while keeping variability estimated from recent weeks. This balances service (avoid big stockouts given large in-transit and high recent demand) against holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time \u22482 (most arrivals at lag 2, occasional lag 3), so I will use the promised/default lead time. Pipeline + in-transit is substantial versus recent high demand spikes, so keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use full-sample stats scaled by (1+L)) to let the OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding overfitting to recent volatile bursts.

Large in-transit balance already covers multiple future periods. Use L='calculate' to reflect observed average lead time (2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical demand while the large pipeline reduces need for aggressive upward adjustments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time confirmed at 2 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning around Period 10 (much higher weekly demand since Periods 10-31). I therefore keep L as default (promised=2) because concluded arrivals consistently match L=2. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent ~20 periods since the regime change, capped at 20) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L) demand and volatility in the current high-demand regime. This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to balance profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Historical concluded lead times cluster at 2 periods (with an occasional 3); no sustained new lead-time signal. Given large in-transit quantity and confirmed historical lead time=2, use default lead time and population-wide demand statistics so the OR backend computes base-stock and caps using full sample mean/variance. This balances service (use historical mean covering (1+L) periods) against holding cost given high pipeline.

Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=438 (large pipeline from prior high orders). Historical concluded lead times cluster at 2 periods (confirmed repeatedly), so keep promised/default lead time. Recent demand has moderated compared to the mid-season spike (Periods 10\u201320) \u2014 the last 6 concluded demand samples (Periods 28\u201333) are most relevant for the next (1+L) review+lead window; use recent_N=6 to capture current demand level and recent volatility. Using recent_N reduces overstating demand from earlier spike while the large in-transit quantity already provides cover versus stockouts. This balances service (avoid more urgent orders while pipeline is high) against holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand (Periods 30-34 = 40,53,25,31,27) averages \u224835 units/week, much lower than the earlier spike (Periods 10-16). Lead-time observations in concluded history consistently support a 2-period mode but with occasional 3; use calculated average to let backend blend observed values. Use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to capture the current lower-demand regime and avoid inflating forecasts from the earlier spike. This keeps base-stock responsive to current demand while the large in-transit (438) will be reconciled by the OR engine when computing pipeline coverage.

Historical concluded lead times are predominantly 2 periods with occasional 3 (observed LT samples: 2,2,2,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,3) so use calculated average lead time to reflect observed data. No recent sustained demand regime change since previously recorded shift at Period 13; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend applies its baseline demand estimate while respecting the empirically inferred lead time. This balances service level (using observed L) against holding cost given the large in-transit stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 \u2014 large pipeline exists so avoid over-ordering. Recent concluded arrivals show variable lead times with recent values [P35:3, P30:2, P27:2, P26:3, P22:2] \u2192 use recent_N for L (N=5) to capture current average ~2.4. Recent demand (last 9 periods: Periods 28-36) shows a lower/steady regime (~15\u201358, avg \u224835) versus earlier peaks; use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current demand regime and volatility. These choices reduce ordering while pipeline clears and align service level to current demand to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has settled to a lower regime since late Aug/Sep (recent 8 periods demands: 40,53,25,31,27,15,11,8; avg \u224828.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (large pipeline covering many weeks). Lead time history repeatedly confirms ~2 periods. I set L to default (promised 2). I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent stable low-demand regime; this prevents overstocking from earlier mid-year spikes while the large in-transit position reduces urgency to inflate the base stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows high variability with a sustained demand regime increase earlier (Periods 10-12) but more moderate weekly demand since. On-hand=0, in-transit=431 \u2014 substantial pipeline that will cover multiple periods even if some shipments are delayed. Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) average ~2.1 periods; majority are 2 with occasional 3. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses the empirical average lead time, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, which balances service (using observed lead time) against holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been low (~15-30/week) after the large spike in Periods 10-20. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=431 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,2,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,3] \u2192 avg \u2248 2.09. I will let the backend use the calculated average lead time to capture slight variability, and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with the large in-transit position this avoids over-ordering while the backend's capped policy limits order size.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 \u2014 large pipeline available so avoid aggressive replenishment. Recent weekly demand (Periods 36-40) = [11,8,15,8,14], showing a low/stable regime vs earlier spikes; no new multi-period lead-time evidence beyond previously recorded. Set L to promised (default). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align the base-stock calculation with the most recent low-demand regime and reduce holding risk given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 units (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show typical lead_time \u22482 (many confirmed 2-period arrivals, occasional 3). Recent demands (Periods 30\u201341) are low relative to mid-year spike; no new sustained regime shift detected. Use L=default (promised 2) to align with confirmed behavior and the OR engine's assumptions. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, letting the large in-transit volume and historical variability inform order quantities while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise or possibly lost shipments.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent realized demand has returned to a low, stable regime since mid-2019 after the large spike in Periods 10-15; on-hand=0 but large in-transit=431 (coverage for multiple weeks). Promised lead time remains 2 and prior concluded arrivals consistently support L=2. To avoid overstocking given heavy pipeline, keep L as default (promised=2). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (avoid inflated forecasts from the earlier spike). I choose N=12 (captures recent \u22483 months of weeks, >=3 and <=20) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 12 demands and sqrt(1+L)*std of last 12 demands; this reduces target base stock and caps replenishment, balancing service vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time \u22482 (mostly 2, occasional 3); recent demand (Periods 39-43 = 8,14,3,36,47) shows a pickup in the last 2 weeks. To be responsive to the recent upward demand while avoiding excessive holding, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures the recent uptick). These parameters let the backend compute a base-stock that balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=431 units \u2014 large pipeline likely covers several periods of demand. Historical concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times with occasional 1\u20133; average observed lead time \u22482.1. Recent demand (Periods 35\u201344) is moderate-to-low with a couple short spikes; no sustained new demand regime. To be conservative and let the OR backend use observed lead-time history and full-sample demand statistics, set L to the calculated average of observed lead times and use default demand mean/volatility ((1+L)*mean, sqrt(1+L)*std) so the engine balances service level with holding cost given the large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=431. Historical concluded arrivals consistently support actual lead time = promised 2 periods (confirmed in prior concludes). Demand history shows a past regime shift (Periods 10-12) but no new sustained changepoint since. Given confirmed lead time and no fresh demand regime evidence, use default (promised) lead time so the OR backend applies its calibrated base-stock formula using all samples. Defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing profit vs holding cost while leveraging the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent history shows large intermittent demand spikes (e.g., Periods 13-20) but no new sustained regime change since last recorded insight. On-hand=0, in-transit=431 (large pipeline). Promised lead time=2 and prior concluded messages repeatedly confirm ~2 periods; occasional 3-periods appear isolated. To avoid overreacting to volatile recent spikes while the pipeline is already large, use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand moments so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 => moderate fill target) against high current in-transit inventory and holding cost risk.
