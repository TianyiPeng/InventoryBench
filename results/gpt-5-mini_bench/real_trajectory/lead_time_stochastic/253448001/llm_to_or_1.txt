Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples: mean=56, recent values 51,39,58,70,62). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time changes or lost shipments. Promised lead time is 2. Profit/Holding ratio (4/(4+1)=0.8) implies high service level; use default estimates so OR backend applies base-stock derived from full-sample mean/variance over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This balances service with holding given current stable recent history and no evidence of regime shift.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=76 (ordered P1) and Period1 conclude shows demand=74 but no arrivals yet (cannot infer lead time). Promised L=2 remains appropriate (no concluded lead-time evidence). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the five available weekly demand samples (includes the observed 62 and earlier weeks) scaled for review+lead period; use default sigma_hat to reflect full-sample variability. No evidence of sustained demand or lead-time regime change, so keep conservative estimates to balance service-level vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand mean = 56 (samples: 51,39,58,70,62). On-hand=0, in-transit=158. Promised L=2; both prior orders (P1,P2) have not concluded but only two missed-conclude events\u2014insufficient to confirm lead-time change or lost shipments. In-transit (158) slightly below (1+L)*mean = 168 expected coverage for 3 periods, so maintain default conservative forecasting. Choose default lead time and default demand moments so backend uses all historical samples to compute base-stock and cap while allowing the OR engine to handle service/holding tradeoff given profit $4 and holding $1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical demand mean = 56 units/week (samples: 51,39,58,70,62). On-hand=0, in-transit=198 (orders placed P1=76, P2=82, P3=40) but no arrivals concluded through Period 3 \u2192 shipments overdue relative to promised L=2. I set L explicit=3 to account for observed multi-period delays (being conservative so pipeline coverage (1+L) reflects slower arrivals). Using mu_hat default lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) = 4\xd756 for the review+lead demand forecast; sigma_hat default lets backend scale historical std by sqrt(1+L). This combination increases target base-stock to improve service given delayed arrivals while relying on historical variability to avoid excessive overstock.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed P1-P3 (76,82,40 = 198 units) have not concluded by Period 3 conclude; evidence of sustained shipment delay beyond promised 2-period lead time.

=== Period 4 Summary ===
253448001: ordered=55, arrived=82 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=82, demand=43, sold=43, ending on-hand inventory=39
Daily Profit: $172.00, Daily Holding Cost: $39.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=39, in-transit=171. Historical sample mean available (weeks in Jan\u2013Feb). Concluded evidence: Period 4 shows order from P2 arrived with lead_time=2 (consistent with promised L=2); earlier missing arrivals (P1,P3) are noted but not yet a confirmed sustained change. I therefore use default lead time so the OR backend uses the promised L=2, and default mu_hat and sigma_hat so demand estimates use all samples scaled by (1+L). This keeps the base-stock anchored to historical average while avoiding overreaction to potentially lost/isolated shipments, balancing service level (profit $4 vs stockouts) against holding cost $1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history shows an observed lead time of 2 (Period 2 order arrived in Period 4). On-hand=4, in-transit=171; some earlier orders (P1-P3) were delayed but P2 confirmed LT=2. Demand history mean=56/week (samples: 51,39,58,70,62). I choose L by calculate to reflect observed lead times, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (observed: P2 order arrived P4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=178. Historical weekly mean demand = 56 (from provided samples). Recent conclues confirm actual observed lead time = 2 for at least one order and no sustained multi-period change since then. Pipeline (178) already covers (1+L)*mean demand = 3*56=168, so no adjustment to forecast or lead time is needed. Use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates to let OR backend cap orders given current ample pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand 0, in-transit 178; recent demand shows downward shift versus Jan samples. Promised lead time is 2 and prior concludes confirm lead time=2 (Period6). Some earlier orders were delayed, but latest evidence supports using promised lead time. I set L=default to use promised 2-period lead time. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=7) to capture the most recent 7 observed demands (periods 1-7 average = 46 units) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean and reflects the recent lower demand. Sigma uses recent_N N=7 to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service (using recent demand mean over the review+lead horizon) against holding cost given limited on-hand and large in-transit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand (Periods 4-8 = 43,35,27,37,55) averages ~39.4/week; no clear sustained upward regime but last week jumped to 55. On-hand=0, in-transit=171 \u2014 earlier P1-P3 orders remain unconcluded (possible lost) but Period 6 arrival confirms lead time=2 for later shipments. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with contract. Set mu_hat based on recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime while smoothing older pre-game samples. Match sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. This balances service (cover next 3-week demand with L=2) versus holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=171. Historical concluded arrivals show actual observed lead times = 2 (P2->P4) and 2 (P6->P8); earlier orders (P1-P3) remained delayed/lost but more recent evidence confirms lead time=2. Profit=$4, holding=$1 implies service-level tilt but holding cost nontrivial. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (will yield 2). For demand I use 'default' ( (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples ) to anchor forecast on historical weekly mean (mean=56 \u2192 mu_hat\u2248168 for L=2) and 'default' sigma to reflect historical variability; this balances higher service level (profit>holding) against inventory cost while keeping settings robust to earlier lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=171 (sufficient coverage). Observed concluded lead times equal promised 2 (confirmed P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8), so use default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 6-10 = 27,37,55,40,40) best reflects current regime, so use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on latest behavior while avoiding stale early samples. This balances service (cover near-term demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=171 (covers upcoming demand given L\u22482). Past early orders (P1,P3) remain unconfirmed but P2 did arrive, so use observed lead-time evidence. Choose L=calculate to set lead time to the average of observed lead times (supports backend alignment). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (stable historical base: mean=56). This balances service (profit/holding ratio) while avoiding overreaction to missing early arrivals; current in-transit stock should cover the pipeline requirement.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded lead-time observations (P4: P2\u2192P4, P8: P6\u2192P8) confirm actual lead time \u22482. On-hand=0, in-transit=171 which roughly covers (1+L) periods of expected demand. Historical demand samples (51,39,58,70,62) have mean 56; with L=2 the default (1+L)\xd7mean = 168, so pipeline ~171 is appropriate. Some early orders (P1,P3) never concluded indicating lost shipments historically, but recent concluded arrivals support L=2. Using default demand/volatility keeps the OR backend\u2019s standard estimator consistent with observed data and balances service vs. holding costs given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 2 (P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=171 (covers future demand partially). Historical weekly mean demand = 56 (samples 2019-01-07..02-04). I set L by calculation of observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=2. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, giving a balanced base-stock that accounts for 3-period coverage and observed variability while avoiding overreaction to missing earlier shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent concluded history shows actual observed lead times of 2 periods (orders P2->P4, P6->P8). Multiple early orders (P1,P3) failed to conclude suggesting some lost shipments, but the most recent confirmed arrivals are consistent with lead_time=2. Demand history includes the provided historical samples (51,39,58,70,62) and later observed weekly demands (used only for evaluation). I choose L by 'calculate' to reflect the average of observed lead times (captures confirmed 2-period arrivals). For demand forecast and volatility I use 'default' so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), providing a stable baseline given no sustained demand regime change. This balances service (using confirmed LT) against holding cost while acknowledging earlier lost shipments.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent weeks show high demand spikes (weeks with demand up to 113 and 80). On-hand=0, in-transit=186 \u2014 sufficient to cover the (L+1) rolling demand forecast. Concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 2 for observed shipments (use promised/default lead time). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) so the OR engine leverages the full historical sample set and the promised lead time; this avoids overfitting to the recent volatile weeks while the in-transit stock already provides coverage.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 2 periods (observed P2\u2192P4, P6\u2192P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=191 (contains many earlier un-concluded shipments). Demand historically (sample seed) mean \u224856/week; with promised L=2 I use the backend defaults so baseline demand across (1+L) periods and volatility are computed from all samples. Defaults keep the OR engine formulaic (base_stock = (1+L)*mean + z\xb7\u03c3) while respecting the confirmed 2-period lead time and existing in-transit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $80.00

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been elevated (see P14-P17) and on-hand is 0 with 172 units in-transit. Several early orders (P1-P3) failed to conclude on-time, but subsequent concluded arrivals show observed lead times of 2,2,2,1 -> some variability. Using 'calculate' for L lets the backend average observed lead times; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend scale demand statistics by (1+L) while accounting for variability. This balances higher recent demand against holding cost by letting OR compute base stock from estimated lead time and historical demand statistics. The 172 in-transit will be counted as pipeline by the backend when computing net order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 (2019-05-13): avg demand increased from ~56 (historical P1-P5 mean) to ~74.5 (P14-P17 mean), +33% over prior baseline; evidence: P14=113, P15=80, P16=63, P17=42

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=190 (several earlier orders delayed/lost but recent concludes show mostly 2-period lead time). Demand shifted up at Period 14; recent regime (Periods 14-18) shows elevated demand. Set L=calculate to let backend average observed lead times (captures mixture of 1s and 2s seen recently). Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures the new higher-demand regime). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility in the same window. These choices prioritize meeting higher recent demand while keeping safety stock responsive to current variability and observed lead-time behavior.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand elevated since Period 14 (regime avg ~74.5 vs prior ~56). On-hand=0, in-transit=230 (large pipeline; some past orders experienced delays/losses). Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,2,1,1] \u2192 use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N with N=6 (samples P14-P19) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These settings aim to size base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while letting the OR engine account for pipeline and lead-time uncertainty.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows a sustained demand uplift beginning Period 14 (large spike P14=113 then elevated weeks), and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=234 units. Observed concluded lead times = [2,2,2,1,1] (avg 1.6) so I let backend calculate L from observed lead times. To capture the post-changepoint demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 14\u201320, 7 samples) so the forecast and volatility reflect the higher, more recent demand while the backend will compute base_stock and the capped order using these inputs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=234 (includes long-unconfirmed early orders: P1-P3 totals 198 never concluded -> possible lost/delayed shipments). Observed concluded lead times: 2,2,2,1,1 => avg=1.6. Demand recent history shows elevated mean since Period 14 (confirmed earlier). Given mixed observed lead times and prior promise=2, set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed average. Use default demand/volatility (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances higher service level from elevated recent demand while letting OR cap limit prevent over-ordering given uncertain in-transit pipeline and possible lost shipments.

Historical concluded lead times = {2,2,2,1,1,2} \u2192 average ~1.67, so use calculated average lead time. Demand regime shifted up at Period 14 (P14-17 mean ~74.5 vs prior ~56); to capture the higher recent demand, use recent_N for demand mean/volatility over the most recent regime (Periods 14\u201322, 9 samples). These choices balance service (capture higher mean and observed lead-time >1) while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4).

For demand I forecast using the recent post-changepoint regime (Periods 14\u201323) to capture the sustained higher demand; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N equal to the regime length (10) so the backend builds base stock for the new demand level while keeping variance responsive.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been variable since the spike at P14\u2013P17; on-hand=0, in-transit=230 (so pipeline is sizable though some earlier orders were delayed/lost). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20132), so I let the backend compute the empirical average lead time from observed concludes (method=calculate). For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to focus the forecast on the most recent 8 demand observations (Periods 18\u201325) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current post-spike regime and avoid overweighting early-season samples. This balances service (using recent demand signal) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand is elevated (notably P14=113, P15=80, P26=111) and on-hand=0, in-transit=230. Historical concluded lead-time observations: 2,2,2,1,1,2 (avg = 1.67). Use calculated L to reflect observed lead-time behavior rather than promised blindly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, preserving the confirmed demand regime shift evidence while letting OR engine set the base-stock tradeoff given profit/holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=230. Historical concludes show variable lead times but recent concluded arrivals (P4,P8,P17,P19,P22) imply average lead time ~1.67; earlier multi-period missing shipments were transient. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 48,29,43,111,113 -> mean ~68.8, high variance). To capture the recent higher mean and volatility I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and sigma, and use calculate for L so the backend averages observed lead times. This balances higher service level for the recent demand spike while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit excess holding given $1 holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand increased since Period 14 (confirmed +33% vs baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=265 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover upcoming demand if it arrives. Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2 periods with occasional 1; several early orders (P1-P3) were delayed/lost but later orders consistently concluded. I choose L='calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (captures occasional 1s and predominant 2s). For demand I use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (use last 15 samples since Period 14 regime start). This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/09/02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=265. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times but overall average > promised 2 sometimes and <=2 other times; use backend's observed-average calculation for L. Demand exhibits a sustained higher regime starting Period 14 (mean ~74.5) and recent weeks (Periods 14\u201329) remain elevated; use recent data to set demand mean and volatility so base_stock reflects the higher demand and avoids stockouts while limiting holding cost risk.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=230. Concluded history shows mixed but centered around 2-period lead time (several confirmed 2s, some 1s); recent confirmed evidence supports using the promised lead time to avoid overreacting to occasional faster arrivals. Demand history shows a sustained upward regime since Period 14; given no new abrupt shifts in the last periods, use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std over the full sample set. This balances service (use promised L) versus holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=230 (sufficient pipeline cover vs. elevated recent demand). Historical concluded lead times show variability but average ~1.7; I use 'calculate' to let backend set L based on observed lead times. Demand shifted up around Period 14 (recorded previously); I use recent_N demand estimate to capture the post-changepoint regime (use last 18 observed demand samples covering the higher-demand regime) and match sigma to the same window so the base-stock reflects higher mean and recent volatility while avoiding overstating variability from older low-demand periods. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given sizable in-transit stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent history shows actual lead time behaving like promised L=2 (multiple concluded arrivals with 2-period lag, most recently P30 arrival from P28). Demand had a sustained upward regime around Periods 14\u201317 (already recorded). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=238 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to typical weekly demand samples and likely covers multiple (1+L) periods, so use default/statistical aggregation to let the OR engine compute base-stock and caps. Therefore select default lead time and default demand moments so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). No new sustained changepoints detected.

Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (observations: 2,2,2,1,1,2,2) so I let the backend compute the average lead time from observed concludes. Demand history shows a sustained higher regime since Period 14; but no new recent changepoint beyond that already recorded, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let the OR engine produce a base-stock balancing profit vs. holding cost. The large in-transit quantity will be reconciled by the system when arrivals conclude.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand baseline from historical samples = mean 56 units/week. Concluded lead-time observations = [2,2,2,1,1,2,2] -> avg LT \u22481.714. On-hand=0, in-transit=238 (covers demand for ~238/56\u22484.25 weeks, which exceeds (1+L) demand). To reflect observed faster-than-promised arrivals on average, set L by averaging concluded Ls. Use default demand scaling so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all_samples (leverages full-sample baseline of 56). Use default sigma (full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This keeps orders conservative given large pipeline (avoid over-ordering) while accounting for observed LT shorter than promised.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift upward since Period 14 and variable but mostly ~2-period arrivals with occasional 1\u20133 period realizations; on-hand=0, in-transit=230 (covers multiple weeks). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed concluded lead times (captures the observed 1\u20133 variability). For forecasting I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine computes base-stock with the inferred average lead time while keeping demand estimate anchored to full-sample history\u2014this balances service level (covering the elevated demand regime) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=230. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed series: 2,2,2,1,1,2,2,3) with recent behavior slightly below promised 2 but occasional 3; average of the last 5 observed lead times \u22481.8 \u2014 use recent_N to reflect this. Recent demand (most recent 5 concluded periods: P32-P36 demands = 26,41,38,29,40; mean \u224834.8) is well below earlier summer spikes; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime. These choices let the OR backend size base-stock to current demand and modestly reduced lead-time estimate, limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 while preserving service by covering (1+L) periods of near-term demand. No single-period arrivals are visible yet; in-transit=230 will be reconciled when arrivals conclude.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=230. Historical concluded lead times show variability (observed sequence includes 2,2,2,1,1,2,2,3); I use a recent average to capture current effective lead-time. Demand has had past regime shifts (noted earlier around Period 14) but recent weeks (Periods 33-37 demands: 41,38,29,40,36) show a lower steady mean; I base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the last 5 demand samples to reflect the most recent demand level and volatility, and scale across review+lead periods. These choices help the OR backend set a base-stock aligned to current observed lead-time and recent demand, avoiding overstock from older high-demand episodes while preserving service with the in-transit stock accounted for.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=230. Historical concluded lead-times show variability (observed lead_times = [2,2,2,1,1,2,2,2,3], recent average \u22481.89) so I use a recent-average for L to reflect that mix. Recent demand (last 5 periods: P34-P38 = 38,29,40,36,34) is lower (~35.4) than the early-year baseline, so I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) for mu_hat and match sigma_hat to the same recent window to capture current volatility. These choices keep the backend's base-stock responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while accounting for lead-time variability and the sizable in-transit buffer.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=230. Historical concluded lead times show variability (1\u20133 periods) and some lost shipments earlier; recent concluded arrivals support using an empirical average lead time. Demand had a sustained shift around Period 14 but recent weeks (Periods 35\u201339) show a return to lower baseline (~29\u201340/week). To balance service vs holding cost: set L to be calculated from observed lead times; forecast demand using a recent-window mean (last 5 samples) to capture current lower regime; estimate volatility from the same recent 5 samples so safety stock reflects recent variability. In-transit of 230 is large relative to (1+L)*recent demand, so these settings temper new ordering.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows demand elevated vs early baseline with a prior sustained regime shift around Period 14; current on-hand=0, in-transit=230 (sizable pipeline). Multiple concluded arrivals give observed lead times [2,2,2,1,1,2,2,3] \u2192 average \u22481.875. Some earlier orders experienced prolonged delays/losses but recent concludes show lead time clustering near 2. I select L by calculating the average of observed lead times to reflect empirical supplier performance. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend blend historical demand with the chosen L; this leverages the sizable in-transit inventory and avoids overfitting to short-term noise while accounting for empirically observed lead-time behavior.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent weekly demand has been muted (last 5 demands \u2248 36,34,31,29,45 \u2192 mean \u224835). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 230 (large pipeline). Observed lead times have varied recently (1\u20133 periods); to capture recent variability I use a short recent window. Set L by recent_N to reflect recent observed lead times. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime, preventing over-ordering given the large in-transit balance and moderate recent demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=230. Historical concludes show variable lead times (observed samples include 2,2,2,1,1,2,2,3 \u2192 average \u22481.875); use calculated average lead time to reflect observed reality rather than the promised value. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift around Period 14 (higher mean) and subsequent variability; to capture recent demand patterns while smoothing noise I select recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the last 20 demand samples (scaled by 1+L) for mean and volatility estimates. These choices balance service (capture elevated recent demand) against holding cost by basing targets on recent realized demand and observed lead-time behavior.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09): demand has been moderate recently (last 5 demands = 31,29,45,58,20). On-hand=0, in-transit=230 \u2014 pipeline is large but previous history shows mixed/occasionally delayed arrivals. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use the empirical average of observed concluded lead times (captures the mix of 1\u20133 period realizations). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to weight the most recent low/variable December demand rather than the long-run higher baseline; this reduces overstocking given high in-transit. Sigma left as default so the backend uses overall sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices balance service (using observed lead time) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and recent lower demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=230 (large pipeline). Recent demand (Periods 40-44) = [29,45,58,20,45], recent mean \u224839.4. Promised lead time=2; recent concluded arrivals confirm lead time has often been 2 (some earlier delays but no new sustained shift). I use L=default to keep promised lead time (2) because concluded history supports it overall and the large in-transit stock reduces risk of stockout. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the latest demand regime (captures recent seasonality/volatility around Dec) so the OR backend sizes the base stock to current demand without over-weighting older low-demand periods. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given in-transit) against holding cost by leaning on recent demand evidence.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=230. Recent weekly demand has varied with some Dec uptick (periods 43-45: 20,45,65) but no new sustained regime change since the previously recorded shift in May. Several historical shipments showed delays early, but lead-time was confirmed as 2 in Period 6 and no new consistent lead-time change is evident in concluded history. Given a promised L=2, a (1+L)=3 period cover is appropriate; combined with a large in-transit position (230 units) I keep the backend defaults so the engine uses full historical mean/variance and the promised lead time to avoid over-ordering while preserving service. Methods: use default lead time and default demand moments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=230. Historical conclude messages show variable actual lead times (observed 1\u20133, average ~1.9) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (higher mean). To balance service vs holding cost: set L to be calculated from observed lead times so backend learns actual average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand data. This uses the large in-transit position to avoid over-ordering while ensuring (1+L)-period coverage of the elevated recent demand.
