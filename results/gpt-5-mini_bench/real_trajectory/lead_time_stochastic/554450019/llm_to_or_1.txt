Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand shows low baseline (31\u201344) with one recent spike (109 on 2019-02-04) \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need cover for review+lead period. Promised lead time used (default) because no concluded arrivals to suggest a different actual lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend uses all samples (spike included) but does not overreact to a single-week outlier; this balances service level versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=105 (order placed Period 2 decision phase was 105; Period 1 order shows ordered=105 arrived=0 which is consistent with promised lead time=2). Historical weekly demand samples (37,31,44,34,109) have mean=51 and std\u224829.3. No concluded arrivals yet to infer a lead-time change or lost shipment; demand shows one high week (109) but not a sustained regime shift. Use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all historical data ((1+L)\xd7mean) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level against equal profit/holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=184 (orders from P1/P2). Promised lead time=2 but neither P1 nor P2 orders have concluded yet; only two missed arrivals\u2014insufficient to confirm lost shipments or lead-time change, so keep L as default (promised). Demand shows a clear upward shift: recent three weeks (2019-02-04:109, 2019-02-11:112, 2019-02-18:81) average >> earlier weeks (~37). To capture this regime, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) so the OR backend uses the (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 samples. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect increased volatility in the same recent window. This balances higher service-level needs against holding cost while remaining conservative on lead-time inference.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-02-04: previous avg (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-28)=37.33, recent avg (2019-02-04 to 2019-02-18)=100.67 (+169.6%)

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent demand has jumped vs. Jan: recent samples (2019-02-04, and Periods 1-3 demands 112,81,52) show a higher regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=302 (multiple earlier orders still not concluded \u2192 evidence shipments are delayed beyond the promised L=2). To protect service during the higher-demand regime and account for probable extended lead time, I set lead time explicitly longer and base demand forecasts on the most recent regime samples (captures the post-2019-02-04 elevated mean). Using recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters increase target base-stock to avoid stockouts while recognizing holding cost parity (profit=holding so q=0.5) \u2014 the OR backend will compute safety stock via z* and cap by its formula.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning 2019-02-04 (samples since then: 109,112,81,52,79). On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (covers several periods). One concluded arrival shows actual observed lead time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). I set L by calculating observed lead times (use all observed). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the post-changepoint regime (5 recent samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the new higher mean while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (profit=holding equal) by using recent demand to size base stock and recent volatility to set safety stock.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weekly demand elevated since 2019-02-04 (carry-over insight already recorded). On-hand=0, in-transit=275; arrivals have been sporadic (only Period 2 order confirmed arriving with lead_time=2). I treat lead time as the observed average (calculate) since observed arrival shows L=2. Demand appears to have a new regime starting Period 3 (P3\u2013P5 = 52,79,75); use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new, lower-but-elevated short-run mean/volatility. This keeps target base-stock responsive to the confirmed regime shift while avoiding overreacting to older pre-shift samples. No new sustained shipment/lead-time anomaly confirmed beyond the single observed L=2.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has shifted up (carry-over insight from Period 3) and the last several weekly demands are ~75\u201379. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 \u2014 pipeline appears sufficient for multiple weeks (3-period cover \u2248225 units at ~75/wk). Concluded arrivals show lead time consistent with promised 2 periods (Period 4 conclude: order on P2 arrived with L=2). I therefore keep L at default (promised=2). To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime and recent weekly volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses most recent 5 demand samples) so the OR backend targets the current higher mean while reflecting recent variability; this balances service level against holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=275. History shows at least one confirmed lead time=2 (Period2 order arrived Period4); earlier orders (e.g., Period1) did not conclude and appear delayed/lost. To reflect observed actual lead-time evidence use L=calculate (avg observed lead times = 2). Demand shows a regime shift noted earlier; to focus the forecast on the post-shift pattern I use recent_N for demand (last 5 periods) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets current higher mean and recent volatility while limiting excessive holding given holding cost = profit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-02-04 (samples since then: 2019-02-04=109, Period4-8 demands=79,75,78,89,110). On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (covers multiple outstanding orders); one concluded arrival shows lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4). No sustained evidence of lead-time >2 or lost shipments beyond that single confirmation. I set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 2). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (6 samples since 2019-02-04). This raises base_stock to meet the sustained higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock for variability. These choices balance service (avoid stockouts in new regime) against holding cost given profit=holding so symmetric risk.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has been elevated since the regime shift noted in Period 3 (weekly demands since shift: 79,75,78,89,110,72). On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (these arrivals are not yet concluded; do not infer lead-time from them). Observed concluded lead-time remains consistent with promised 2 periods (Period2 order arrived in Period4). To capture the higher recent mean while keeping variance responsive, set L to default (use promised 2). Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the six post-shift samples. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base stock to cover the sustained higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N helps the OR engine size safety stock appropriately given increased variability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (outstanding orders from earlier periods). Observed one concluded arrival showing lead_time=2 (Period4 arrival of Period2 order), so promised lead time=2 remains plausible though some earlier orders delayed/lost. Demand since the detected regime shift (starting 2019-02-04) has been higher and relatively stable. I use default lead time (promised L=2) to keep alignment with observed confirmed arrival, and use recent demand statistics to capture the post-shift regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (regime from Period3->Period10 has 8 samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the recent higher-demand regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29. Recent demand has been higher since the Feb changepoint noted in carry-over history; latest concluded demands (Periods 4\u201311) = [79,75,78,89,110,72,61,49]. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (pipeline large). I set L by calculating observed lead-times (recent concluded evidence shows lead_time=2). For demand I use recent_N (last 8 concluded demand samples) to capture the sustained higher regime; same recent window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These params steer the OR engine to a base-stock that covers the (1+L) review+lead window under the elevated-demand regime while using pipeline inventory to avoid over-ordering given the large in-transit volume.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent observed demand has declined from the Feb\u2013Mar spike; last 6 concluded weekly demands (Periods 7\u201312 = 89,110,72,61,49,47) show a lower recent mean (~71.3). Only one confirmed arrival implies actual lead time not reliably different from promised. I use promised lead time (default) and set demand parameters using a recent_N window (N=6) to capture the recent lower regime; sigma also based on the same recent window. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand (last 10 concl periods) = [79,75,78,89,110,72,61,49,47,60], mean=72.0, std used for volatility. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 which covers ~275/( (1+2)*72 )\u22481.27 cycles of expected demand for (1+L)=3 periods \u2014 some pipeline but not excessive; several earlier orders never concluded but one observed arrival shows lead time=2. I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) -> confirms 2. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained higher regime since Feb; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR engine size base stock to meet the elevated recent demand while using recent variance to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=2 (Period2\u2192Period4); many prior periods had zero arrivals but only one confirmed lead-time observation\u2014conservative approach: keep L as promised. Demand regime shift was previously detected (higher mean since 2019-02-04); therefore forecast using recent demand. Use recent_N with N=12 (covers the post-change regime up to current period) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the elevated demand while accounting for recent variability. This keeps base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand, while the large in-transit quantity limits immediate extra ordering risk.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=275. Promised lead time=2. Historical concluded arrival shows at least one 2-period lead time (Period4 conclude: order on P2 arrived P4). Recent history shows elevated demand relative to earliest samples but a regime shift was previously recorded; no new sustained changepoint since. Given profit=holding, service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0) so no safety stock uplift is needed beyond forecast. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across available samples; this keeps the policy stable while existing in-transit inventory (275) is consumed.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=275. We have one observed lead-time (order on P2 arrived P4 => LT=2) so use calculated lead time to match evidence. No new sustained demand or lead-time shifts since prior insight; use default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend uses full sample history. This balances service (use observed LT=2) without overfitting recent noise while in-transit stock (275) is sufficient for multiple review+lead periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=275 \u2014 sizable pipeline but no visible recent arrivals (many periods of arrived=0), though one concluded arrival shows actual lead time = 2 (Period 4 conclude: P2\u2192arrived, LT=2). Promised LT=2 remains supported by observed conclusion; I therefore use L=default. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting 2019-02-04 (documented previously). To focus the forecast on the most recent demand pattern and reduce influence of early low samples, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (captures the last 10 demand observations). This balances service (captures recent higher mean) against holding cost given current large in-transit inventory so we avoid over-ordering while letting OR backend size orders against recent demand volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=0, in-transit=275. Only one concluded lead-time observation (Period 4: P2\u2192P4, L=2). Recent demand (last 6 periods: P13\u2013P18) averages notably lower (~45 units) than the early-Feb spike, so I focus the forecast on recent demand to avoid excess holding. Set L to calculated average of observed lead times (uses observed data =2). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 6 demand samples, which balances service vs holding given current lower demand and substantial in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:

Demand spiked in early Feb but has since settled to lower levels (recent 16 weeks avg \u2248 ~58). To avoid excess holding given equal profit and holding cost, use recent demand for (1+L) forecast. Set L to promised (default). Use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current lower-demand regime while smoothing volatility from prior spike. This balances service vs holding given large in-transit stock.

Historical demand (Periods 1\u201320) mean \u224861.3/week; demand shows earlier regime shift but no new sustained change since prior insight. Use calculated lead time (observed avg = 2 periods) to align with observed arrival at Period 4. Use default demand sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) so the OR engine uses full-sample mean across the review+lead window and default volatility to let the backend compute safety stock given promised lead time. This balances service (cover multi-period demand) vs holding cost conservatively given large in-transit volume and no new confirmed changepoint.

Early-year regime shift (Period 3) increased demand then, but recent weekly demand (Periods 5\u201321) is consistently lower (~15\u2013110, recent weeks ~25\u201349). To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost given equal profit/holding ($1/$1) I use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the recent regime. Selected recent_N=17 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime since Period 5 and reduce influence of the early spike. Same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility.

Recent demand (last several weeks) is lower than the early Feb spike; to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime I use recent samples. I set L by calculating average observed lead times (uses confirmed evidence). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to emphasize the current low-demand pattern (N=10 covers the most recent 10 weeks). This keeps the base-stock tuned to recent demand and avoids excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Promised lead time=2 with prior confirmed observation of 2 periods; use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=2. In-transit stock (275) already covers multiple (1+L)=3-period demand at typical averages, so use default demand and volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to avoid overreacting to short-term low demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent weekly demand has fallen from the Feb/Mar spike to low summer levels (last 8 weeks: 37,28,34,15,25,15,10,10). On-hand=0, in-transit=275 \u2014 pipeline looks large but many prior orders never concluded, so lost-shipment risk exists; however no concluded arrivals since Period 4 so lead time not re-estimated. I therefore keep L as promised (default=2) and base demand estimates on the most recent regime (last 8 weeks) to avoid overstating forecast after the winter spike. I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect the current lower-mean, lower-volatility summer regime; this reduces ordering compared with using the long-run mean and limits holding cost given holding=profit. These parameters help the OR backend target service while avoiding excess inventory if some in-transit becomes confirmed or lost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (many in-transit units have not concluded since Period 4 arrival; only confirmed lead_time observation is 2 from P2\u2192P4). Recent demand has fallen from spring peaks to a low steady level (~10\u201334/week). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the most recent stable low-demand regime. I choose recent_N with N=8 (last 8 weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect current low demand; L left as default to rely on promised 2-period lead time because concluded evidence is limited. This keeps base-stock responsive to recent lower demand and caps inventory growth given existing large in-transit volume.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been low (weeks ~15,10,10,11,12) following the earlier Feb spike already recorded. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 units \u2014 ample coverage versus recent low demand. Observed concluded lead time(s): one observed arrival showing lead_time=2 (Period 4), so use calculated lead time. To respect the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 (captures the most recent ~10 weeks, N chosen as regime_length\u224810). This biases the base-stock toward current low demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=275. Historical concluded arrivals show a lead time of 2 when observed (Period 4 conclusion), and no sustained evidence of a different lead time since\u2014use promised lead time. Demand has been in a low, stable summer regime over the past 11 concluded periods (Periods 17\u201327: demands = 37,28,34,15,25,15,10,10,11,12,20). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture the current low-demand regime so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand based on the most relevant recent data and avoids excess holding cost given holding=profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=275. Historical concluded arrivals show an observed lead time of 2 periods (Period 4: order on P2 arrived P4), so no sustained lead-time change. Recent weekly demand (since Feb) shows the earlier documented regime shift (higher mean), but no new sustained change since. Given matching observed lead time and lack of new demand regime evidence, use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps policy aligned with historical statistics while relying on backend cap logic to limit ordering against pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand 0, in-transit 275. Historical conclude messages show one confirmed lead time = 2 (Period 2 order arrived Period 4); no sustained evidence of lead-time drift or new lost-shipment pattern. Demand has declined since the Feb spike noted earlier; recent 12 weeks (Periods 18\u201329) show a stable lower regime (approx mean ~18 units/week). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time=2. For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to capture the current lower-demand regime across the review+lead horizon. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent volatility. These settings prioritize matching inventory to the current lower demand while the large in-transit quantity (275) will cover upcoming weeks and avoid excessive additional orders.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (large pipeline). Historical demand: early-2019 spike around Feb/Mar, but the recent 20 weeks (Periods 11\u201330) show a lower steady demand (roughly 47\u219231\u219210\u201331 range). Only one concluded arrival confirms lead_time=2 so keep promised lead time. To avoid excess holding given profit=holding, cap service by forecasting recent demand: set mu_hat using recent_N=20 (captures the low recent regime) and reduce volatility estimate similarly with sigma_hat recent_N=20. This uses pipeline (275) plus modest target base_stock to satisfy (L+1) periods of current lower demand while limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent data shows an isolated large demand spike (Period 31 demand=177) but no sustained new regime beyond the earlier Feb 2019 shift already recorded. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 \u2014 pipeline appears sizable relative to typical weekly demand and likely covers multiple weeks. No concluded arrivals since early periods confirm promised lead time=2, so use default promised L to avoid overfitting to the single large recent spike. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history; this balances service (by using long-run demand estimates including the earlier regime shift) against holding costs and avoids inflating orders due to one-week outlier.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (coverage exists but arrivals not yet observed). Promised lead time=2; most historical concluded lead-time evidence matches 2 (Period4 shows order on P2 arrived P4). Demand recently spiked (P31=177, P32=97) so use a recent-window forecast to capture upward shift while limiting weight of older low-demand weeks. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (backend expects promised L), mu_hat using recent_N over the last 8 weekly samples to reflect the recent higher demand, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture recent volatility. This increases target base stock to improve service during the recent demand surge while the cap prevents excessive ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=275. Recent demand has spiked and become volatile (recent concluded demands: 31,177,97,331) vs earlier low summer weeks; historical changepoint recorded (Period 3) indicates higher baseline since Feb. In-transit stock (275) provides coverage but actual arrivals historically matched promised lead time when observed (one concluded lead_time=2). I keep L at default (promised=2). To capture the recent elevated/volatile demand, I use a recent_N forecast for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime; I choose N=8 to cover the latest weeks while keeping the sample >=3 and <=20. This biases the base stock toward recent demand spikes to avoid stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has sharply increased since early Sept (Periods 31\u201334: 177, 97, 331, 110) indicating a new high-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (some pipeline present). Promised lead time=2 was confirmed earlier (Period 4 conclude: order from P2 arrived with lead_time 2). To be responsive to the Sept demand spike I set L=default to keep promised lead time, and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts reflect the elevated mean and volatility from the most recent 4-week high-demand regime. This balances service (capture surge) vs holding cost by focusing estimates on the current regime while relying on promised lead time.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent weeks (Periods 31-35) show a sustained demand uplift versus summer baseline. On-hand=0, in-transit=537 units; promised lead time=2 periods and historical concluded arrivals confirm lead_time=2 (Period4 arrival). I set L=default to use promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 31-35). Sigma also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. With (1+L) factor the OR backend will target stock for the elevated recent mean while the large in-transit (537) already covers several review+lead periods, reducing the immediate need for extra ordering and limiting holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31 (2019-09-02): recent avg over Periods 31-35 = 163.4 vs prior baseline avg (Periods 24-30) = 15.29 (+969%), sustained 5-period uplift.

Recent observed lead times: P4 showed 2 (order P2\u2192P4) and P36 showed 1 (order P35\u2192P36) -> use recent_N to capture current shorter but variable lead time. Demand has a sustained high regime starting Period 31 (documented) but recent weeks show volatility; use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the latest demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. These parameters aim to keep pipeline covering (1+L) periods of elevated demand without overstocking given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand regime: sustained uplift beginning Period 31 (weekly demands since P31: 177,97,331,110,102,52,56) \u2014 7-week regime. On-hand=154, in-transit=275 (sufficient short-term cover but demand elevated). Observed concluded lead times: one 2-period (order P2\u2192arrived P4) and one 1-period (order P35\u2192arrived P36) \u2192 use average observed lead time. Set L by calculating average of observed lead times to reflect mixed evidence. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covering the confirmed recent high-demand regime) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the new higher demand while keeping holding costs controlled by using a recent-regime estimate rather than the long-run mean.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 31 (weeks 31-38). Observed lead times: two concluded observations (P4 showed L=2 for P2 order; P36 showed L=1 for P35 order). To balance service vs holding cost: set L as recent_N (N=2) to let backend average the two observed lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period reality). For demand, use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 31\u201338, regime length=8) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean/volatility; N=8 chosen per regime detection rules (max(min(regime_length,20),3)). Current on-hand=64 + in-transit=275 => pipeline 339, which comfortably covers several periods of elevated demand but using recent_N demand forecast ensures orders match the higher regime while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 31 (2019-09-02) \u2014 9 high-demand weeks (P31\u2013P39). Concluded arrivals show mixed lead-times: P4 arrival (order P2) had lead_time=2, P36 arrival (order P35) had lead_time=1; I use the average of the last 2 observed lead-times to capture this variability. On-hand=15 + in-transit=317 provides substantial cover; to keep service for the elevated regime while limiting holding cost, I use recent data (the 9-week high-demand regime) for demand mean and volatility inputs so the OR engine targets stock for the current high-demand regime rather than older low-demand data.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand regime: sustained uplift starting Period 31 (large, sustained increases through Periods 31\u201340). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=340 \u2014 pipeline appears large but contains recent undelivered orders (some arrivals have been 1 or 2 periods). Observed concluded lead times: 2 (P4 arrival from P2) and 1 (P36 arrival from P35); I use recent_N=2 to estimate L (captures the mixed 1\u20132 evidence). For demand I use recent_N over the recent post-changepoint regime: regime from Period 31 onward (regime_length=10), so N=10 to capture the sustained higher mean and variability. Using recent 10-period demand for mu_hat and sigma_hat biases the base stock and cap toward the elevated demand while recent lead-time averaging prevents overreacting to a single short/long arrival. This balances service (avoid stockouts under the new high-demand regime) against holding cost by using recent regime statistics rather than the long historical low-demand mean.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times: P4 (order P2) =2, P36 (order P35)=1, P41 (order P39)=2 \u2192 average lead time ~1.67. On-hand=7, in-transit=298 (large pipeline). To reflect sustained high demand since Period 31, I use recent data for demand estimates (covering the recent high-demand regime). Set L by calculating the average of observed lead times to let the OR backend adjust review+lead horizon. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 31\u201341) to capture the elevated mean and volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts in high regime) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times: P4 (order P2) =2, P36 (order P35)=1, P41 (order P39)=2 \u2192 average ~1.667. Demand regime: sustained high-demand regime since Period 31; recent window (Periods 31\u201342) length=12 shows elevated weekly demand. To balance service vs holding (profit=holding), I set L by calculate (average observed lead time) so backend accounts for realized variability. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 to reflect the current elevated demand regime and recent volatility, ensuring base-stock and cap reflect the uptick while avoiding oversized orders given existing large in-transit pipeline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=1, in-transit=286 (sizable pipeline). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,3} (Periods 4,36,41,43). Demand recent windows (Periods 39-43) show elevated/variable weekly demand (~48 avg, high variance). To reflect recent lead-time variability use recent_N over last 4 observed lead times. To capture current demand regime and volatility use recent_N over last 5 demand samples (Periods 39-43). These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward recent higher demand while accounting for pipeline; they help the backend order enough to meet (1+L) periods of demand but limit excess holding since profit=holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=286. Recent concluded lead times: 2,1,2,3 \u2192 average \u22482. No new sustained demand regime beyond previously recorded Sept uplift; recent weekly demand has declined from Oct peaks but not a 3+ period sustained new regime. To balance service vs holding cost given variable lead times, use calculated average lead time (captures observed variability) and recent demand statistics to adapt to the post-peak decline. Selected L via calculate to reflect observed mean lead time \u22482. Mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=10) to emphasize the last 10 weeks of demand (captures late-October peak and subsequent drop) so the base-stock targets and safety stock respond to the recent pattern while avoiding overreaction to single-week swings. This leverages the large in-transit position (286) to avoid excessive new orders while maintaining serviceability over the (1+L) review+lead horizon.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=275. Historical concluded lead times: [2,1,2,3,3,2] (avg=2.17) with recent observations [3,3,2] -> recent avg ~2.67, so occasional 3-period delays are occurring. Demand experienced a sustained high regime starting Period 31 (many samples since); use recent-demand window to capture current elevated mean/volatility. I choose L by recent_N (N=3) to bias toward the most recent longer lead-time observations (protect against 3-period delays). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=15 (covers the post-changepoint high-demand regime from Period 31 onward) so base stock reflects the sustained uplift and higher variability. These settings aim to ensure pipeline + order cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while capping excessive overstock given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (ample pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133 periods) with recent arrivals showing 3,2,3,2 \u2014 I use a recent average to reflect current variability. Demand has been elevated since the regime shift around 2019-09 (sustained higher mean); recent weekly demand (Periods 42-46) is [91,22,14,16,19] so I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture short-run post-peak behavior. Using recent_N for L and mu_hat keeps the OR base-stock responsive to recent lead-time and demand regime; sigma_hat default lets the backend use historical volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts while large in-transit exists) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.
