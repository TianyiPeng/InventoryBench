The 02-04 spike (109) is a single-week surge and does not meet the 3+ period threshold to declare a sustained regime change, so treat it as possible promotion/one-off. Demand forecast: use a conservative blended estimate biased toward the pre-spike baseline (~36.5 units/week) with some uplift for the recent spike; target ~37\u201340 units/week. Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised LT=2 periods. No on-hand, no in-transit; any order placed now will only arrive in Period 3. Decision logic: need coverage for (L+1)=3 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after ordering). Using ~37\u201340 units/week -> 3-period coverage \u2248 110 units. This balances service (avoid stockouts) versus holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period equals profit/unit), and avoids overcommitting to the single high week.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: SKU is seasonal apparel (jeans) in late December; no major upcoming spikes after Christmas. Demand regime: historical recent demand shows a large spike in P31\u2013P33 (avg ~201) then returned to lower levels (P34\u2013P46 mostly 14\u2013110, recent weeks 14\u201391, multi-week avg \u224840\u201360). No new sustained upward demand regime. Lead-time / orders: supplier promised L=2. Evidence of delayed/lost shipments: several past orders arrived with L=2, but multiple orders (including P34:300) remain unconfirmed. Current in-transit=590 likely includes P34 and earlier outstanding shipments that have not concluded by P46, indicating ongoing supplier delays or uncertain arrivals. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=590 (unconfirmed arrival dates). Given holding cost = profit per unit ($1 hold vs $1 profit), carrying inventory yields no net benefit unless it will be sold immediately; overstocking risks negative reward. Final action logic: do not place new orders until we observe arrivals/conclusions that clarify actual lead time and confirm demand regime persistence. With large ambiguous pipeline and recent demand back to moderate/low levels, order=0 to avoid exacerbating holding costs and to wait for confirmation of in-transit shipments.",
  "carry_over_insight": "Delayed/unconfirmed shipments persist: orders since Period34 (including P34:300) contribute to in-transit=590 but have not concluded by Period46; treat these arrivals as uncertain (ongoing supplier delay) until confirmed.",
