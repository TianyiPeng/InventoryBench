Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward shift (0,0,61,98,152), likely seasonal ramp for swimwear. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead periods. Use promised lead time (default L=2) because no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (samples 61,98,152; mean \u2248103.7); mu_hat=(1+L)*mean to cover review+lead. Use sigma recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward higher service during seasonal ramp while keeping variability estimate recent to avoid overstock from older zeros.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: last 3 samples (61,98,152) mean=103.67 vs prior two samples mean=0 \u2014 sustained 3-period increase.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand regime shift detected starting 2019-01-21: last 3 samples = {61,98,152} (mean=103.67) vs prior samples ~0. On-hand=0, in-transit=179 (Period1 order showed arrived=0 in conclude \u2192 cannot infer shorter/longer lead time yet). Use promised lead time to avoid premature lead-time revision. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (forecast over review+lead period). Set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to the confirmed demand increase while avoiding overreaction to a single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=350. Promised lead time=2; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time not confirmed and shipments are not yet overdue. Historical weekly samples show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (last 3 samples: 61,98,152). To capture the new higher demand I use recent demand statistics over the last 3 samples (N=3). I keep L as default (promised lead time=2) because there is no concluded evidence to change it. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new regime and raise target base-stock to cover (1+L) review+lead period demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility. This balances higher service level for the confirmed demand increase against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=494, prior three concluded periods show ordered shipments but arrived=0 (possible lost/delayed shipments) \u2014 however no concluded arrivals exist to confirm a lead-time change, so retain promised lead time. Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (last 3 samples: 61,98,152; mean=103.67). To capture the new higher demand while avoiding unneeded exposure to holding cost, I use the promised lead time (default) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the recent 3-sample regime. This gives the OR engine a demand forecast reflecting the new regime while keeping L conservative given missing arrival confirmations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $171.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=0, In-transit=346. Concluded arrival (Period 4) shows an order placed on Period 2 arrived with lead_time=2 \u2192 actual lead time confirmed as 2. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21: last 3 samples = {61,98,152}, mean=103.67. I therefore set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed LT=2. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent_mean (responsive to the regime) while recognizing substantial in-transit stock (346 \u2248 3\xd7103.7) so the OR engine will cap new orders and avoid overstocking.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has been elevated and stable since the Jan-21 regime shift; last 5 demands = [129,213,175,173,181], mean=174.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=561 (multiple outstanding orders; one observed arrival confirmed actual lead time=2 for a prior order). I set L='calculate' to use observed lead-time data (confirmed 2 periods) so backend adapts if more lead-time data appears. For demand I use recent_N N=5 to focus the forecast on the sustained higher-demand regime (captures current weekly average). I use sigma recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward current demand while avoiding overweighting old zero-demand weeks; they help the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime (recent demands: P4=173, P5=181, P6=200). Observed lead times from concluded periods: order on P2\u2192arrived P4 (LT=2), order on P5\u2192arrived P6 (LT=1) \u2014 use a recent average to reflect variability. Set L using recent_N over last 2 observed lead times to capture current mean LT\u22481.5. Forecast demand using recent_N over last 3 demand observations to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L) factor applied by backend). Use recent_N for sigma with same N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance higher service level for elevated demand while keeping volatility and lead-time uncertainty explicit for the OR engine; no new lost-shipment pattern confirmed beyond prior notes.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand regime confirmed by early samples: elevated weekly demand since 2019-01-21 (samples 61,98,152). On-hand=0, in-transit=539 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times: Period4 shows order from P2 arrived with lead_time=2; Period6 shows order from P5 arrived with lead_time=1 \u2192 mixed evidence. I choose L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to let backend infer ~1.5 so orders account for variability. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (use last 3 samples which drove the regime shift). For sigma I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the backend cap orders using its cap calculation and the averaged lead time to mitigate overordering given pipeline=539.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has accelerated (recent demands: 173,181,200,268,376) and on-hand=0 with large in-transit=456. Observed lead times in concluded history = {P4:2, P6:1, P8:1} -> use recent average of last 3 observed lead times to capture recent shortening. Use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility to anchor the OR engine to the most recent high-demand regime while keeping variability from the last 5 periods. This balances higher target base-stock for service during the demand surge vs holding cost, and leverages large in-transit volume to avoid overordering.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=719 \u2014 substantial pipeline present. Concluded lead-times observed: 2,1,1 (avg\u22481.33) indicating lead-time variability and some early arrivals; some orders have arrived earlier than promised but variability is real. Recent demand has jumped and is sustained: Periods 7-9 demand = 268,376,295 (mean\u2248313). To protect service with limited on-hand and high in-transit uncertainty, I set L to a recent average (captures current realized lead-time behavior). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods to reflect the sustained elevated demand regime so the OR backend stocks to cover (1+L) periods of the current higher demand and captures recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: last 3 samples mean=313 vs prior 3-sample mean=103.67 (+202%); sustained high demand over 3 periods (P7-P9).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent demand has been in a higher regime (Period 7-10 spike). On-hand=6, in-transit=566 \u2014 ample pipeline but lead times have varied between 1\u20132 periods in concluded arrivals. I set L to "calculate" so backend uses observed lead-time average (captures the 1\u20132 period variability). For demand I use recent_N N=3 (last three concluded demands: 376,295,367) to capture the sustained high-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher provisioning to avoid stockouts during the confirmed high-demand regime while keeping variance-driven safety stock reasonable given holding cost equals profit.

Period 12 (2019-04-29): recent demand is very high and volatile (periods 7-11 demands: 268,376,295,367,477) vs earlier low regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=986 (large pipeline); last order (P11) arrived=0 so some shipments may still be in transit but not lost. I set L=calculate to use the average of all observed concluded lead times (captures observed mix of 1\u20132 period arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to focus the OR forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (reduces understock risk); sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) captures recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand regime while leveraging the large in-transit position.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): recent demand remains high (last periods: P9=295, P10=367, P11=477, P12=468) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=1139. Observed concluded lead times = [2,1,1,2,1] \u2192 average ~1.4, so use calculate to let backend use observed average. Demand appears shifted upward since 2019-03-25 (carry-over); to capture recent high regime I use recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covers the last 6 demand observations to reflect the sustained higher mean/variance). This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given large pipeline: using recent data raises the base_stock for demand spike while sigma_hat recent keeps safety buffer tuned to recent volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand = 88, in-transit = 719 (large pipeline); observed concluded lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods (recent sequence: 2,1,1,2,1,2 \u2192 avg 1.5). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding), I average recent lead times and use recent demand stats to capture the elevated regime while limiting extra inventory: set L to recent_N (N=6) to reflect observed avg lead time ~1.5; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand periods so the OR engine targets adequate safety stock without overreacting to older zeros.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 7 (P7-P14 high weekly sales). On-hand=0, in-transit=917 (large pipeline arriving but arrivals visible only in future concludes). Observed concluded lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods (recent sequence includes multiple 2s and 1s). I choose L by recent_N to capture current realized lead-time mix. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201314, 8 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated demand and its volatility; this biases orders to satisfy high current demand while the large in-transit reduces urgent order size. These settings help the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to the high-demand regime while accounting for realized lead-time variability and existing pipeline inventory.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27. On-hand=0, in-transit=1125. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 or 2 periods); recent pattern shows multiple 2-period arrivals but also 1s \u2014 use recent_N to capture recent average. Demand has sustained high regime since Period 7 (higher mean ~300+); use recent_N over the current high-demand regime to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock reflects elevated demand while accounting for variability. These choices balance service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by using regime-specific statistics rather than long-run low-demand history.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times vary (1 or 2); average of observed lead times is ~1.57 so use calculated average for L to capture actual variability. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; use the same recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR base-stock responsive to the elevated demand while the calculated L captures observed shorter/longer arrivals; the large in-transit quantity will reduce ordering by the capped policy automatically.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=1060. Historical concluded lead times = {2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2} -> average ~1.625; recent concluded arrivals are dominated by 2-period deliveries. Demand has shifted to a higher regime (previous carry-over notes) \u2014 recent demand (Periods 13-17) shows elevated weekly demand. To capture the observed lead-time mix I use 'calculate' (avg observed) for L so the OR engine internal L reflects realized variability. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 13-17) so mu_hat reflects the sustained higher-demand regime (reduces stockouts). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=5 to capture current volatility. These choices bias orders toward higher coverage of (1+L) periods to prioritize service (profit and lost-sale risk) given profit=holding cost, while recent-based variance avoids underestimating uncertainty from the recent high-demand regime.

======================================================================

Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=1185. Recent concluded arrivals show observed lead times mostly =2 in the most recent arrivals (Periods 13,14,17), so I set L via recent_N to capture recent lead-time behavior. Demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime since Period 7; recent demand (Periods 14-18 = 417,370,525,330,302) averages ~389. To target service while controlling holding cost (profit=holding), I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent mean over the review+lead horizon, and match sigma_hat to recent variability (N=5) so the OR engine caps orders appropriately given observed volatility and pipeline.

Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 7 (sustained higher weekly demand); use recent demand samples to reflect current elevated demand and volatility. Choosing recent_N for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat (N=5) lets the backend adapt to the latest lead-time and demand regime while capping orders via the built-in cap to avoid over-ordering into holding costs.

Demand has been elevated recently (large spike by Period 20). I target recent demand to capture the current high-demand regime: use recent_N (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the latest sustained demand. This balances service (higher forecast) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Several past orders have arrived with mixed lead times (observed lead_times = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1], avg\u22481.56) so I let backend compute an average lead time from observed conclues. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the last 3 realized demands) so the OR base-stock reflects the current elevated demand while the backend caps orders. This balances service (avoid lost sales in peak) against holding cost given large in-transit pipeline and lead-time variability.

Observed concluded lead times (from conclude messages) = [2,1,1,2,1,2,2,2,1,2] \u2192 avg \u22481.6. There is no evidence of a new sustained regime change since prior carry-overs. I set L using 'calculate' to let the backend average observed lead times (captures the ~1.6 realized LT). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to target the (1+L)-period demand forecast based on the latest high-demand regime (Periods 20-22 mean=635), keeping safety responsive to current spike. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias replenishment toward meeting the current high demand while keeping holding risk controlled via the backend cap.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand is in a sustained high regime (Periods 18-23: demands ~302,517,771,592,542,510) so I bias forecast to the recent window. On-hand=143, in-transit=1252 (large pipeline) \u2014 no clear sign of lost shipments in concluded history but observed lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods. I choose L=calculate to let the backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime while avoiding older low-demand samples; same recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while the backend's cap will limit overly large single-period orders given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand remains high (last 5 concluded demands: P20-P24 = 771,592,542,510,710) so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the summer high regime. Observed lead times have varied between 1\u20132 periods across concluded arrivals; I ask backend to calculate the average observed lead time from history. On-hand 0 + in-transit 1617 provides pipeline cover but recent demand volatility justifies using recent_N for mean and std to set base stock and the capped order. Methods chosen balance service (capture sustained high demand) vs holding cost by relying on recent demand stats and empirically inferred lead time.

Demand has remained in the elevated regime since Period 18 (regime length 8 periods); use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory for the current high-demand regime while accounting for recent volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=16, in-transit=1683. Recent concluded lead times show variability with a most-recent observed lead_time=3 (Period 26) but the last three observed lead times average 2.0. Recent demand has softened from the mid-June/July peak; the last 3 demand observations (Periods 24-26 = 710,309,176) are mixed with a 3-period mean ~398. I therefore use recent_N (N=3) for lead time, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to react to the latest regime while relying on a short window to avoid overreacting to single outliers. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit volumes and variable lead times) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base stock from recent demand and recent volatility.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=142, in-transit=1425. Historical concluded arrivals show variable lead times (observed sample avg \u22481.71 periods) with recent mix of 1\u20133; I use 'calculate' for L so backend averages observed lead times. Demand has undergone sustained regime shifts; recent 5-period demand (P23\u2013P27 = 510,710,309,176,132) is most relevant, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-but-volatile summer demand. This balances service (capture recent mean) vs holding cost (avoid inflating base stock using older high-demand periods).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=1425. Recent concluded lead times show variability including a 3-period delay (Period 26 conclude: ordered P23 arrived with lead_time=3) and recent 2s; demand in last 3 periods = [176,132,155] -> recent demand has moderated. To react to the observed longer shipments while keeping targets aligned to the most recent demand regime, I set L to recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent average lead time, and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the immediate 3-period demand profile and recent volatility. This balances service (protects against occasional 3-period delays) and holding cost by not inflating forecasts with older high-demand spikes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=1425 \u2014 sizable pipeline likely covers upcoming demand but past concluded arrivals show variable lead times (1\u20133). Recent demand has cooled from mid-summer peak: last 6 demands (Periods 24-29) = [710,309,176,132,155,139] mean \u2248 268 but volatile. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded history (captures 1\u20133 variability). For demand I use recent_N N=6 to focus the forecast on the post-peak decline and avoid overstating summer peak; sigma_hat also recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward current lower demand while letting L reflect actual delivery variability so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has moderated from midsummer peaks; last 5 weekly demands = [176,132,155,139,78], mean=136. I see variable observed lead times (1\u20133 periods, including a 3-period on P26), so I use a short recent average for LT. Large in-transit (1425) already provides substantial cover versus upcoming demand. I choose recent_N=5 for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses immediate recent demand and recent lead-time behavior while the large pipeline limits additional ordering.

LLM Rationale:

Demand has fallen from mid-summer peaks; last 5 demand samples are lower (Periods 28-32: 155,139,78,65, ? \u2014 using recent sample window to reflect current lower demand). To avoid overstock given high pipeline and equal profit/holding ($1/$1) I select a lead time estimate based on observed history and use recent demand (N=5) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine reduces target stock to match the current lower demand regime while capping orders using its cap policy. This balances service vs holding cost given many units already in transit.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=1425 (large pipeline). Recent demand has dropped since Period 29 (sustained lower demand). Observed concluded lead times vary (avg ~1.71); to be robust to historical variability use calculated average lead time. For demand I detect a recent downward regime starting Period 29 (4 periods); use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent low-demand regime and matches volatility to the recent period. This reduces overstocks given large pipeline while preserving service through the base-stock computation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: prior 3-period mean (P26-P28)=154.33 vs recent 4-period mean (P29-P32)=78.0 (\u221249%), sustained lower demand over 4 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has declined sharply since Period 29 (P29-P33 recent mean \u224869 units/week vs prior regimes). On-hand=0, in-transit=1425 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers many weeks of current low demand; risk of excess holding cost if we inflate forecasts. Observed lead times have varied (1\u20133); use calculated average lead time to let backend reconcile variability. For demand I use a recent window to capture the sustained lower regime: mu_hat recent_N N=5 (captures P29\u2013P33). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent lower volatility. These settings bias orders down while letting the OR engine apply its base-stock math against the sizable in-transit pipeline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=1425 (many outstanding shipments not yet concluded). Concluded lead-time history shows variable actual lead times (samples: 2,1,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,1,3,2) \u2192 use calculate to capture observed average lead time (~1.77). Demand has sustained lower regime beginning Period 29 (Periods 29-34 demand = 139,78,65,30,35,62; recent mean \u224868) so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to anchor forecasts to the new low-demand regime. This keeps the OR backend from over-ordering given a large in-transit pipeline and equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5), balancing service level against holding risk and potential lost shipments.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized since Period 29 (samples P29-P35 mean \u224863.9), while observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average observed lead time used. To be responsive to the new low-demand regime I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=7 covers P29\u2013P35). I select L='calculate' so backend estimates average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures actual 1\u20133 variation). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the sustained lower-demand regime. This keeps base-stock low to avoid holding cost while letting the OR engine account for observed lead-time variability and existing large in-transit pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been in a sustained lower regime since Period 29 (P29-P36 mean \u224861.25 over 8 weeks). Pipeline shows large in-transit (1425) but many past promised arrivals have varied (observed lead times include 1,2,3). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the empirical average of observed lead times (~1.71) to capture the mixed, shifting arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (the length of the confirmed low-demand regime from P29\u2013P36) so mu_hat reflects the current lower demand (backend will scale by 1+L). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching orders to the sustained lower-demand regime while letting the backend account for observed lead-time behavior and the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 29 (periods 29-37 demand: 139,78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50); pipeline is very large (on-hand=0, in-transit=1425) from earlier orders. Observed concluded lead times vary (14 observed: avg \u22481.71), so use calculated average lead time to reflect realized variability. Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 29-37) rather than the full historical series, reducing overordering given the large in-transit stock. These choices balance service (using realized lead time) and holding cost (downweighting older high-demand regime).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (Periods 34-38 = 62,38,43,50,36). Many past concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed concluded lead times is ~1.7. To react to the recent sustained lower-demand regime while letting the backend infer lead time from observed arrivals, I set L to 'calculate' (use observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (capture the new low-demand regime over the last 5 periods). I also use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base stock to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the new lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: Periods 34-38 mean=45.8 vs prior Periods 29-33 mean=68.8 (\u221233%), sustained low demand over 5 periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 29 (weekly demands mostly 30\u201378; recent 10\u201311 periods average well below prior peaks). On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1425 which already covers many weeks; no concluded arrivals this period to change lead-time belief. Set L using calculate to let backend use observed concluded lead times history. For demand, use recent_N with N=11 to focus the (1+L) demand forecast on the most recent low-demand regime (captures Periods 29\u201339). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce forecasted target stock versus longer-horizon averages, avoiding excess holding given high in-transit stock while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 29 (samples P29-P40 mean \u2248 57). On-hand=0, in-transit=1425 (large pipeline). Observed historical lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed lead times ~1.8 so use calculated average to let backend capture empirical lead time. Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the sustained low-demand regime (last 12 weeks P29\u2013P40). This keeps orders conservative given high pipeline and equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5), reducing holding risk while meeting expected low demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 29\u201334 onward (weeks 30\u201341 show consistently low weekly sales). On-hand=0, in-transit=1425 (large pipeline outstanding). Observed concluded lead times vary (1\u20133); average of observed lead times \u22481.71 so I use calculated L to reflect empirical lead-time. To capture the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covers Periods 30\u201341) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility rather than the historical high-season periods. This balances service (avoid excess stock given large in-transit) against holding cost by relying on recent low demand to reduce target base stock while letting the backend cap still limit order size.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=1425. Recent concluded demands (Periods 40-42) = [42,17,113] \u2014 noisy with no sustained 3+ period shift, so no new regime recorded. Many past concluded lead-times vary (1\u20133) but no consistent, sustained change beyond promised lead time; use promised lead time to avoid overreacting. I select default lead time to rely on promised L=2, use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full-sample demand statistics (conservative given noisy recent spikes) and lets the large in-transit pipeline be compared to base stock. This balances service-level (profit=holding cost) while avoiding extra inventory buildup given high current pipeline.

Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=1425 (large pipeline). Historical concluded lead-times vary (1\u20133); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Recent demand shows lower steady rates since Period 33 with a modest recent uptick (Periods 40\u201343 = 42,17,113,51); to avoid overreacting to a single high week while covering near-term demand, forecast using the most recent 4 samples. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to match demand window. This keeps base_stock responsive to recent demand but constrained by large in-transit pipeline, balancing service level and holding cost.

Observed concluded lead times (14 samples) average \u22481.71 periods \u2192 use calculate for L to let backend estimate actual average. To reflect most recent demand regime and recent spike, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures Periods 40\u201344: demand 42,17,113,51,57) so the base-stock is responsive to current variability while accounting for the large in-transit pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=1425 (large pipeline). Observed concluded lead times vary 1\u20133 periods; recent average \u22482 and promised L=2\u2014no strong evidence to override promised lead time. Recent demand has been low since late summer; last 5 concluded demand samples (Periods 41-45) are [17,113,51,57,58] with a low/moderate mean. To be responsive to the recent low-demand regime while accounting for pipeline, I set L to default (promised=2). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, keeping orders aligned to the most recent demand regime and avoiding overstock given holding cost equals profit.

I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time history (captures 1-3 variability). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to focus forecast on the latest low-demand regime (reduces overstock risk given holding cost equals profit). Sigma uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize avoiding excess holding given large in-transit inventory while covering immediate (L+1) periods of demand.
