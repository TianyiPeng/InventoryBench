Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, five weekly historical samples available (46,37,48,57,57). No concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes and no clear recent regime shift. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample, providing conservative baseline coverage for (L+1) periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=63 (ordered in P1; Period 1 conclude shows arrived=0). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time not confirmed\u2014could be delay but insufficient evidence to change promised lead time. Use promised lead time (default) and demand priors from historical samples (weeks in Jan\u2013early Feb mean ~49). Default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine compute (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility; this balances service level with holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=135. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) mean=49 units. No concluded arrivals yet (Period1/2 orders show arrived=0) but this is expected given promised L=2 and arrival confirmation appears only after arrival; insufficient evidence to declare longer lead time or demand regime shift. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates based on all samples to let the OR engine compute base-stock while avoiding premature inflation of forecasts for potential transient delays.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=199 (sum of prior orders 63+72+64). No arrivals have been observed in any concluded period, but this is insufficient to confirm an actual lead-time change (promised L=2 still plausible). Historical weekly demand samples (provided) average ~49 units/week; with promised lead time 2, review+lead = 3 periods. I therefore keep L at the promised default to let the OR engine use its lead-time model, and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using full-sample mean) while avoiding overreacting to potential lost/delayed shipments; if shipments continue to not conclude, I will revise L explicitly in a future period.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical weekly demand samples average ~49 units. Promised lead time = 2; Period 4 conclude shows an order placed in Period 2 arrived in Period 4, confirming lead time = 2. Current on-hand=4 and in-transit=145 (pipeline=149) which roughly covers a 3-period demand (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 147. To align with confirmed lead time and stable historical demand, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap consistently. This balances service (coverage for 3 periods) vs holding cost given sizable pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 2 periods (Period 2 order arrived Period 4)

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=211. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) have mean=49 units/week. Period 4 conclude confirmed actual lead time = 2 periods. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time (L=2) and rely on the full-sample defaults for demand sizing: mu_hat as (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect the 3-period review+lead demand and sigma_hat default to scale observed volatility by sqrt(1+L). This keeps the OR backend aligned with confirmed lead time, uses all available historical demand (no short-lived regime detected), and avoids overreacting to recent missed arrivals (in-transit is already large).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=147. Concluded lead times observed: order from P2 arrived P4 (LT=2), order from P5 arrived P6 (LT=1) \u2192 variable LT, so use calculate (average of observed LT). Recent demand (Periods 1\u20136): [71,148,113,68,64,82] shows elevated and volatile demand vs older samples, so forecast (1+L)\xd7mean using recent_N=6 to capture current regime; use recent_N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices let the OR engine size base-stock using recent demand and inferred average lead time, balancing service (capture recent higher mean) vs holding cost (using only recent data rather than long-ago low samples).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Observed concluded lead times show variability but recent evidence (Period4: LT=2, Period6: LT=1) implies a shorter recent average; use recent_N=2 for L to capture that. Demand in the last 5 concluded periods shows a higher, more current regime (periods 3-7 demands: 113,68,64,82,125) so use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the latest pattern. Volatility has no clear recent structural shift, so use default sigma_hat. These choices balance service (using recent demand) against holding cost and account for observed lead-time variability.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=145. Historical concluded lead-times show variability (observed leads = 2,1,2,1) so use average observed lead time. Demand has shifted up vs the baseline sample set: recent weeks show much higher demand, so forecast using the most recent 5 periods to capture the new regime. Methods chosen: L='calculate' to reflect measured average lead-time (handles mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals); mu_hat='recent_N' N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean and capture current elevated demand; sigma_hat='recent_N' N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters help the OR backend raise target base-stock for higher recent demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost parity (profit=holding).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: baseline (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) mean=49 units/week; recent Periods 4\u20138 mean=98.2 units/week (+100%), sustained over 5 periods

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift (Periods 4\u20138 avg \u224898.2 vs baseline 49) and current on-hand=0 with in-transit=295 units (multiple recent arrivals). Use observed lead-time history to set L by averaging concluded lead-times. For demand sizing, use the recent 5-period regime (Periods 4\u20138) to reflect the doubled baseline; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples to capture current mean and volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat to meet elevated demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). History shows a sustained demand regime shift (Periods 4\u20138 mean \u224898.2 vs baseline \u224849). Observed concluded lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2); recent arrivals skew toward 1\u20132 with short-run average \u22481.33. On-hand=0, in-transit=180. To capture the higher recent demand I use recent_N for demand (N=5 to cover the confirmed 5-period elevated regime). For lead time I use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the most recent observed arrivals (shorter average ~1\u20131.5) while remaining responsive to variability. I set sigma to recent_N N=5 to reflect volatility in the elevated-demand regime. These choices raise the backend base-stock to meet the higher service level implied by recent demand while keeping volatility estimate aligned to recent observations; using recent lead-time average (N=3) avoids over-ordering if lead times are trending shorter.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=393. Historical concluded arrivals show mixed lead times (observed: 2,1,2,1,1 \u2192 avg ~1.4) and a sustained demand regime shift upward vs. baseline. I choose L=calculate to let backend use observed average lead time. Demand has clearly increased recently; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus forecast on the last 5 periods (higher recent mean ~193 units/week) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the much higher recent demand while avoiding overstating variability from older low-demand periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Demand has materially increased vs baseline (carry-over insight: recent periods 4\u20138 mean=98.2 vs historical 49). Current stock: on-hand=0, in-transit=580 (several outstanding receipts; some late arrivals observed historically). I set L to recent_N (N=5) to reflect the average of the five observed concluded lead times (captures mixed 1\u20132 period realizations rather than blindly using promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to base mu_hat on the most recent 7 demand observations (captures the sustained higher-demand regime and reduces understock risk). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward servicing the confirmed higher demand while accounting for the empirically observed lead-time behavior and current in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Demand has shifted to a higher regime (confirmed earlier: Periods 4\u20138 mean ~98.2 vs baseline 49). On-hand=58, in-transit=367 (pipeline healthy). Promised lead time=2; recent concluded arrivals support 1\u20132 variability but overall shipments have arrived\u2014will use promised lead time to match supplier contract. For demand forecast I anchor to the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the latest sustained elevated demand. Volatility similarly uses recent_N N=5. These choices bias orders toward meeting higher recent demand while holding risk is moderate (holding cost = profit), and current pipeline already provides coverage.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent demand has been well above baseline since Periods 4\u20138 and even higher/volatile from Period 9 onward (sustained regime shift noted). On-hand=0, in-transit=417 (large pipeline). Lead-time observations show a mix of 1 and 2 but recent conclutions (Periods 13\u201314) are 2; I use a recent average for L to capture possible reversion to promised 2. For demand I use recent_N to capture the elevated, post-changepoint regime (use recent samples rather than all historical mean). Sigma_hat uses recent_N to reflect increased volatility. These choices provide the OR backend with (1+L)-scaled demand and variability estimates tuned to the sustained higher-demand regime while recognizing recent lead-time evidence; with profit=holding equal, targeting the recent regime reduces stockouts given large in-transit but still uncertain arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=678 (large pipeline). Recent concluded history shows variable actual lead times (1\u20132 periods); several arrivals confirm lead time not fixed. Demand has stepped up substantially in recent periods (see Periods 11\u201315). To reflect observed lead-time variability, set L to 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. To capture the new high-demand regime, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 5 periods: Periods 11\u201315) so forecast and volatility reflect the latest sustained demand. This increases base_stock to meet elevated demand while the OR engine's cap limits overly large single orders. The large in-transit (678) will reduce net ordering need but may include delayed/lost shipments; using observed lead times and recent demand helps balance service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 11\u201315: average demand = 242.6 units/week (Periods 11\u201315 mean), sustained over 5 periods

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=728 (large pipeline). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime in Periods 11\u201315 (avg \u2248242.6/week) and no new lead-time evidence since Period 16; promised lead time remains appropriate. To align the OR engine with the confirmed high-demand regime while avoiding extra explicit ordering (pipeline already large), I use default lead time (promised L=2) and set demand estimates from the most recent 5-period regime (recent_N=5) for both \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 so the backend computes base stock matching the high recent mean/volatility. This balances service (meet high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history shows mixed actual lead times (observed 1s and 2s); average observed lead time \u22481.56 \u2192 use calculated average. Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 11 (carry-over notes) so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the post-changepoint mean/volatility. Chosen methods: L=calculate to reflect observed average lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent 5 demand samples, which balances higher service needs from elevated demand while keeping holding cost in check given substantial in-transit stock (417 units) and on-hand (21).

Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=719. Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2) \u2014 average recent observed lead_time ~1.56 so use calculated average to let backend set L. Demand has shown sustained elevated regimes (notably Periods 11\u201315 avg=242.6); therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand regime rather than the long-run baseline. This balances service (capture higher recent mean/volatility) while relying on backend cap and promised lead-time model to limit overly large single orders given many units already in-transit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has stepped up: last 5 demands (Periods 15\u201319) average \u2248326/week versus earlier regimes; pipeline is large (438 units in-transit) and on-hand = 0. Observed lead times alternate between 1 and 2 periods; use calculated average lead time to let backend infer typical transport behavior. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine scale by (1+L). This balances service (higher target stock for increased demand) with holding cost\u2014large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=978 (large pipeline). Observed concluded history shows variable lead times but promised lead time remains 2; recent arrivals are noisy but no new lead-time confirmation beyond promised. Demand has clearly increased in recent periods: Periods 16\u201320 demands = [344,290,155,652,812], recent-5 mean=450.6 (\xb1 high variance). To respond to the recent high-demand regime while respecting the OR backend's base-stock math, I keep L at the promised default and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated demand level and higher volatility (so backend raises the base-stock and cap appropriately). This uses the latest 5-week regime (Periods 16\u201320) to balance service level vs holding cost given the large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 16\u201320: avg=450.6 units/week (Periods 16\u201320), up from prior regime avg=242.6 (+85%), sustained over 5 periods

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime: Periods 16\u201320 avg=450.6 and latest five periods (P17\u2013P21) demands = [290,155,652,812,529], mean=487.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=1352 (covering some upcoming demand). Promised lead time=2 and historical concludes still support L=2, so use default promised lead time. To match the current high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets ~3 periods of recent demand (1+L=3) and captures recent volatility; N=5 chosen because the recent regime is sustained over 5 periods. This balances service (high recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=145, in-transit=923 \u2192 ample pipeline but lead times have varied (1\u20132 periods). I choose L=calculate to let backend infer average observed lead time from concluded arrivals (captures recent 1 vs 2 variability). For demand I use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages full historical data while the calculated L adjusts the review+lead horizon; this balances service level vs holding cost given current large pipeline.

Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime since Period 16 (carry-over insights): recent weekly demand remains in the 350\u2013650 range (Periods 19\u201323: 652,812,529,395,348). Actual lead time has repeatedly been 2 periods in concluded history (e.g., Period21 order arrived in Period23). To protect service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I use an L estimate that reflects observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (N=5 uses the most recent five weeks to form (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the new higher mean and elevated variability while the OR backend applies its capped ordering rule to limit excessive order quantities.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=1298 (large pipeline). Recent demand regime is high: last 5 weeks demands = {P20:812, P21:529, P22:395, P23:348, P24:422} (mean \u2248 501). I retain promised lead time (default L=2) because concluded history shows mixed 1\u20132 period arrivals but promised 2 is supported and recent concludes include 2-periods. To ensure the base-stock covers the current high-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the sustained high-demand regime). This increases target base stock to match current weekly demand while sigma_hat recent_N=5 captures realized volatility over the same window. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments\u2014pipeline is large (1298) so no extra explicit safety added.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=1504. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 2 in earlier carry-over; recent arrivals show mixed 1\u20132 but no new sustained change. Recent demand (Periods 21\u201325 = 529,395,348,422,240) remains within the high-demand regime recorded earlier (Periods 16\u201320 avg=450.6). In-transit (1504) covers ~3 periods of the high regime demand (3\xd7450.6\u22481352), so no emergency upward adjustment needed. Use default lead time to trust promised L=2; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance, which balances service vs holding given current large pipeline and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has softened from the peak: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 22\u201326) = 395, 348, 422, 240, 112 (mean ~303.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=1504 (large pipeline covering multiple weeks). Observed concluded lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods; use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. To reflect the recent downshift from the extreme peak but still elevated demand vs. 2019 baseline, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (Periods 22\u201326) so the OR engine targets inventory for the current shorter-run regime while the large in-transit stock limits new orders.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Observed lead times in concluded history are typically 1\u20132 periods with prior confirmation of 2-period behavior; promised lead time is 2. Recent demand has declined from the peak (Periods 21\u201323) \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 23\u201327) = [348,422,240,112,91], mean=242.6. On-hand=115 and large in-transit=1298 already cover multiple weeks, so avoid aggressively raising target stock. I set L=default to use the promised 2-period lead time (consistent with observed conclude messages). For mu_hat I use recent_N N=5 so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean (captures the latest regime ~242.6/week). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock aligned with recent demand variability. This balances service (use recent elevated mean) against holding cost given heavy pipeline.

Recent demand (Periods 24\u201328 = 422,240,112,91,112) shows a lower but still elevated regime vs early history; I'll target recent dynamics using the last 5 weeks to capture current demand. Set L=default to use promised 2-period lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to make the OR engine responsive to the current demand level and volatility while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand (Periods 25\u201329 = 240,112,91,112,86) has dropped from prior high regimes and appears to be near ~100 units/week over the last 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1298 (large pipeline covering multiple weeks). Observed concluded lead times have mixed 1\u20132 but promised lead time=2 and prior carry-over confirmed 2; I will keep L as default (promised). To make the forecast responsive to the recent lower demand, I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand across review+lead based on the most recent 5 weeks, letting the large in-transit pipeline avoid stockouts while reducing future orders.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=1298. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods; recent concluded arrivals still include 2-period observations but variability exists, so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer actual mean. Recent demand (Periods 26\u201330 = 112, 91, 112, 86, 31) shows a lower-demand regime versus earlier spikes; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand level and recent volatility. These choices aim to size the base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while avoiding excess holding given high holding cost equal to profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=1298. Historical concludes show actual lead time has often been 2 periods; promised L=2 remains appropriate. Recent demand has fallen from prior high regimes \u2014 last 5 concluded weekly demands (Periods 27\u201331) = [91,112,86,31,26], mean\u224869.2 units/week. To align orders with current lower demand while accounting for the 1-period review + 2-period lead (L+1), I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect the current regime and reduce overstock risk. This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent downturn and leverages the large in-transit inventory (1298) to avoid excessive new orders.

On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1298 covers multiple weeks of demand under promised lead time=2. No clear new lead-time evidence; keep promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime and reduced volatility so the OR engine lowers target base-stock and avoids excess holding cost while pipeline still provides cover.

Demand has fallen sharply in the most recent 5 concluded periods (Periods 29\u201333: 86,31,26,15,29) vs earlier high regimes, so use a recent-demand estimate to avoid overordering. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce forecasted order quantities and safety stock, balancing profit vs holding cost.

On-hand=0 but large in-transit=1298 units (covers many weeks), so avoid forecasting high demand. Promised lead time is 2 periods and historical concluded lead-times are mixed but previously confirmed as 2; therefore keep default L to match supplier promise. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean will scale appropriately). Set sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent low demand volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering given the large pipeline while letting the OR backend compute service-level safety stock consistent with current demand and the promised lead time.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14): on-hand=0, in-transit=1298. Historical concludes confirm promised lead time=2 in multiple periods; recent demand has fallen sharply since mid-summer. Last 10 concluded demands (Periods 26\u201335) average \u224852.9/week versus prior high regimes; last 5 are even lower (\u224819.4). To avoid overstating need given large in-transit pipeline and recent sustained low demand, keep L as default (promised=2) and use recent_N=10 for demand estimates so the OR engine bases base_stock on the most recent low-demand regime while sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This balances service (with large pipeline) against holding cost and reduces risk of excess orders if demand remains subdued. No evidence of new lead-time losses beyond known variability; pipeline (1298) already likely covers multiple weeks of demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=1298 \u2014 large pipeline likely covers upcoming demand. Historical lead-time observations have varied but earlier carry-over confirmed 2-period lead time; recent conclude messages show no new sustained lead-time change. Recent demand has dropped from summer peaks to low autumn weekly sales, but the decline is noisy; no new sustained regime change is recorded per conservative rules. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=2) and default demand estimates so the OR backend's base-stock calculation uses the full historical mean/variance; this avoids overreacting given the large in-transit volume and the risk of lost shipments. This balances service level (use pipeline) against holding cost by not increasing forecast-driven orders.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has collapsed vs earlier summer peaks: Periods 30\u201337 demands = [31,26,15,29,11,16,17,10], avg \u224819.4/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=1298 (ample pipeline stock relative to current low demand). Historical concluded lead times show mostly 2-period behavior; use promised lead time. To reflect the persistent low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 periods (Periods 30\u201337) so the OR backend sizes base stock low and avoids excess holding given in-transit buffer.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 30\u201337: avg=19.4 units/week (Periods 30\u201337), down from prior regime avg=450.6 (-95.7%), sustained over 8 periods

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has settled into the low regime observed in Periods 30\u201337 (avg \u224819.4/wk); on-hand=0, in-transit=1298 which currently provides substantial coverage but arrivals are only visible after conclude. No new sustained lead-time evidence since prior confirmation of L=2. I therefore keep L at the promised default=2, and set demand forecast using the recent low-demand regime (recent_N with N=8 covering Periods 30\u201337) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders to the current low baseline and avoids excess holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has collapsed to the low regime identified at Period 38 (Periods 30\u201337 avg=19.4/wk, sustained). On-hand=0, in-transit=1298 (large pipeline). Use promised lead time (default) since historical concludes support L=2 and no new sustained lead-time change. For demand forecast, use recent_N over the confirmed low-demand regime (regime length=8) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 samples; same recent_N window for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This keeps base-stock small relative to current low demand while the large in-transit pipeline prevents stockouts, balancing service vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=1298. Recent demand regime (Periods 30\u201340) is low (~~19 units/week historically identified). Promised lead time remains reliable in concluded history; use default promised L to keep backend aware of contractual lead time. To align ordering with the recent low-demand regime and avoid excess inventory given large in-transit, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 11 periods (Periods 30\u201340) so the base-stock and cap reflect the low recent mean and volatility. This reduces ordering compared with using all-sample averages and helps balance service vs holding cost given heavy pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Periods 30\u201341 (recent 12-week mean \u224819.2 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=1298 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals support promised lead time=2 in earlier periods; no new sustained lead-time evidence. I set L to default (promised 2). For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to capture the current low-demand regime (reduces ordering vs. prior high regimes). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices prevent the OR engine from over-ordering despite large in-transit stock and align safety stock to the current low-demand regime, balancing service level and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=1298 \u2014 pipeline is very large relative to recent weekly demand. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time ~2 periods; recent demand regime (Periods 30\u201337) was low (avg ~19.4/week) and sustained for 8 periods, and subsequent weeks remain low. I keep L as default (promised 2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent low-demand regime (regime_length=8) so the OR backend will compute a conservative base stock and cap reflecting the current low-volatility, low-mean demand while avoiding excess additional ordering given large in-transit inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 30 (carry-over previously recorded: Period 30\u201337 avg\u224819.4/week, and low demand persisted through Periods 38\u201343). On-hand=0, in-transit=1298 (large pipeline relative to current low demand). Use observed lead times to infer L rather than default promised value. Set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (captures realized variability including 1 and 2 period outcomes). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime to reflect the new baseline; choose N=14 (covers Periods 30\u201343 available samples, capped rules). These parameters keep target base-stock low to avoid holding cost given high pipeline, while relying on recent realized lead-time for realistic replenishment timing.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand is 0 but large in-transit (1298) exists \u2014 avoid over-ordering. Promised lead time remains 2 periods and historical concluded messages confirm L=2 earlier; no robust evidence lead time has shifted recently. I set L to default (use promised 2). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 to anchor forecast to the sustained low-demand regime (keeps base-stock low to avoid holding cost while pipeline covers short-term service). This balances the 1:1 profit/holding cost by reducing safety stock after the clear drop in demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=1298 units \u2014 pipeline is already very large relative to current weekly demand, so we should use a short/confirmed lead time and base recent demand to size safety. Set L to default (promised 2). Use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime (stable for >8 weeks), letting the OR backend scale orders to recent demand and account for observed volatility; this avoids overreacting to older high-demand regimes while recognizing the large pipeline.

Promised lead time remains 2; no recent concluded evidence to change it. I choose L=default to let backend use promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean over last 9 samples). Sigma uses recent_N N=9 to reflect recent low-volatility. These settings reduce replenishment targets to match the low-demand regime and avoid adding inventory to the already-large in-transit pipeline, balancing service vs holding cost.
