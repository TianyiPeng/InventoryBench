Shorts are mildly seasonal toward spring/summer, but historical weekly demand for this SKU (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) averages ~48.6 units/week (45,52,45,54,47). No evidence of a recent regime shift. Lead time promised = 2 periods, and there are no in-transit or on-hand units. Given the lead-time mechanics, an order placed now must cover demand for the current period plus the next 2 periods (L+1 = 3 periods) because arrivals happen after the decision and only become visible later. Forecast demand per period \u2248 49 units. Target pipeline = 49 \xd7 3 = 147 units. With on-hand + in-transit = 0, place an order to cover ~147 units. Rounded to a practical whole-unit order and favoring slightly higher service due to low holding cost relative to profit (Profit = $19 vs Holding = $1/period), I order 150 units.",

On-hand=0 but in-transit=360 units (ample vs expected near-term demand). Supplier lead time has varied historically (1\u20132 periods) but no new sustained lead-time signal in recent concludes. Ordering now would risk high holding cost when demand is low; in-transit inventory should cover many weeks. Therefore place no new order this period.",
