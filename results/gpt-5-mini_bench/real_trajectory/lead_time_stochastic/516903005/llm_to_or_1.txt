Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [20,14,19,18,18], mean=17.8, no arrivals or in-transit inventory, no concluded lead-time evidence or sustained demand shift. Use promised lead time and population statistics: set L to default (promised 2). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (using profit/holding cost) with holding cost given no sign of regime change or delayed shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand mean = 17.8 (samples: 20,14,19,18,18). On-hand=0, in-transit=22 (order placed Period 1 concluded as arrived=0). No concluded arrivals beyond promised lead time observed, so no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipment. Use promised lead time (default) to let backend assume L=2. Use default demand/volatility (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (covers L+1 periods) vs holding cost without overreacting to unconfirmed delays.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly mean demand ~17.8 (Jan samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=45 (orders from P1+P2). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred; no sustained demand regime shift detected. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=66 which equals sum of prior orders (22+23+21). No concluded arrivals yet; only the P1 order is now overdue by the promised L=2 but this single missed arrival is insufficient to confirm a lead-time change or lost shipments. Demand history (5 weekly samples, mean ~17.8) shows no recent regime shift. Therefore keep L as default (promised), and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost while avoiding premature corrections for a possibly late but not yet confirmed lost shipment.

Daily Reward (R_t): $57.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show baseline demand; recent concluded periods demand: P1=11, P2=31, P3=14, P4=16. On-hand 7 + in-transit 43 = 50 units; arrivals seen in Period 4: 23 units (ordered P2) which implies orders of 22 (P1) and 21 (P3) remain in-transit (22+21=43). No sustained demand regime change detected and observed lead time equals promised (one confirmed observation of 2 periods). I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level using historical mean/variance while avoiding overfitting to recent noise.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=55. Demand history shows mixed weeks (recent demands 11,31,14,16,19) and provided historical samples (20,14,19,18,18). Period 4 conclude confirmed an actual lead time of 2 periods (order on P2 arrived on P4), matching the promised lead time; other orders have not yet concluded but absence is not yet a sustained lost-shipment signal. I therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses all available samples to compute base-stock while keeping parameters conservative given limited evidence of a regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $48.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=50. Observed concluded arrivals show mixed lead times: Period4 arrival (ordered P2) implies LT=2; Period6 arrival (ordered P5) implies LT=1. Recent observed Ls = [2,1]; I choose recent_N to average the last 2 observed lead times. Demand has risen in recent weeks (P4-P6 = 16,19,34) vs earlier (P1-P3 = 11,31,14 and historical Jan samples). To be responsive to the recent upward regime while limiting holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 5 demand samples to weight recent demand patterns. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances higher service needs from rising demand with the $1 holding cost and $4 profit margin.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 4: avg demand P1-P3 = 18.67, avg P4-P6 = 23.00 (+23.2%)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent demand has stepped up since Period 4 (carry-over note). On-hand=0, in-transit=82 \u2014 pipeline appears large but arrivals have exhibited variability (observed lead times 2 and 1). I set L to be the calculated average of observed lead times to let the OR engine adapt to realized variability. For demand, I use recent_N (N=4) covering the post-changepoint regime (Periods 4\u20137) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the base stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping volatility calibrated to avoid excessive holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand regime uplift detected starting Period 4 (carry-over). Current on-hand=5, in-transit=58 (no new evidence of lost shipments). Observed concluded lead times = {2,1,2,1} \u2192 use calculate to let backend average observed lead time. Demand has shifted higher since Period 4; use recent_N on the most recent regime (Periods 4\u20138, length=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher mean/volatility. This balances service (cover (1+L) review+lead demand) against holding cost by targeting forecast and uncertainty from the recent regime rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand elevated since Period 4 (confirmed carry-over insight). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2 periods); average of last 4 observed lead times = 1.5, so use recent estimate to reflect variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=95 (provides buffer vs. higher recent demand). For demand forecast use recent 6 periods (P4\u2013P9) to capture the new higher regime (regime length=6) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained increase; this raises base_stock to improve service while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to limit stockouts without excessive holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent concluded arrivals show mixed lead times {2,1,2,1,2,1} (avg 1.5) so I let backend compute the average observed lead time. Demand has clearly shifted up since Period 4 (recent regime); to capture the elevated mean/volatility I use recent_N on the most recent regime. On-hand=26 + in-transit=51 =77 units; using a recent_N forecast (with L inferred by backend) will size orders to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand while the capped order will limit excessive ordering and holding cost. This balances service (avoid stockouts given higher recent demand) against holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 4 (+23%); observed lead times vary (1 and 2 periods). On-hand=10, in-transit=74 (total pipeline=84) which is sufficient short-term but we must plan for (1+L) periods of demand. Set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures mixed 1/2 pattern). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 4-11) to capture the higher post-changepoint regime; same N=8 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service need after the confirmed regime shift while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=86. Historical concluded lead times show mixed 1\u20132 periods (observed W={2,1,2,1,2,1}, avg=1.5) so actual LT differs from promised sometimes. Demand shifted up starting Period 4 (carry-over note). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times so the backend uses the empirical average. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 4\u201312 constitute the new regime length) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean/volatility; this helps balance service level (capture the +23% uplift) against holding cost while accounting for shorter/longer realized lead times and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent history shows a sustained demand increase starting Period 4 (user-provided insight). On-hand=9, in-transit=74 (no new conclude indicating lost shipments). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 and 2) so use calculated average implicitly for backend but prefer backend 'calculate' to capture observed variability. For demand, use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to reflect the higher mean (regime length = 10 periods), so set mu_hat recent_N N=10. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand shows a sustained uplift since Period 4 (user note: avg rose ~23.0 vs 18.7 prior). On-hand=4, in-transit=73 (pipeline large). Observed concluded lead times vary (1 or 2 periods); use calculate to let backend average observed lead times. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples incorporating the inferred L. This balances service (captures increased recent mean) while the large pipeline limits aggressive ordering, reducing holding cost risk.

I set L using recent_N to capture the most recent lead-time behavior. For demand I use recent_N (last 5 weeks: Periods 11-15) to capture the post-shift higher mean and recent variability, and apply the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. This balances service (accounting for elevated recent demand and slightly >1 promised lead time) against holding cost given current in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=77. Historical concluded lead times show a mix of 1 and 2 periods (no sustained shift but variable); demand exhibits a sustained regime shift beginning Period 4 (+23% higher average). To reflect uncertain lead time use the empirical average of observed lead times. For demand, use the recent regime (post-changepoint) to capture the higher mean and variability: select recent_N over the most recent regime (Period 4 onward). These settings raise the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility, which increases target base-stock to improve service given the elevated demand while the L choice hedges against mixed observed lead times. Carrying in-transit inventory into pipeline reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent concluded arrivals show mostly 2-period lead times but some 1-period cases; the average of the most recent observed lead times favors slightly below 2, so I use a recent-average to reflect that. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 4 (higher mean); use recent_N over that post-change regime to capture elevated demand and variance. On-hand=0, in-transit=83 \u2014 using recent demand over the new regime will size orders to cover (1+L) periods of higher demand while recent L keeps pipeline timing realistic.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 4 (higher mean since P4). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=84 (pipeline provides coverage but arrival timing uncertain). Observed concluded lead times mostly 2 periods with some 1-period arrivals; average observed lead time \u22481.75 \u2192 use 'calculate' so backend averages observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (N=15 periods from P4\u2013P18) to capture the higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward the newer, higher-demand regime while letting the backend compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff and the inferred lead time.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 4 (noted earlier). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=83 \u2014 pipeline is substantial but some prior orders showed mixed lead-times (1\u20132) and occasional zero arrivals, so I'll hedge lead-time with a recent average. Set L by averaging the last 5 observed lead-times to capture recent variability (captures the 1\u20132 oscillation). For demand I use the recent regime (P4 onward) with N=16 periods to reflect the sustained +23% uplift since Period 4. Use the same N=16 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts under the higher regime while the recent lead-time average mitigates overshooting given in-transit inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=83. Observed concluded lead times vary between 1 and 2 periods (mixed history), so use calculated average lead time to let backend infer typical L from observed arrivals. Demand shows a historical uptick starting Period 4 but recent weeks are noisy; use EWMA to balance longer-run uplift with recent softening (gamma=0.3). Keep sigma as default (uses all samples) so variability is estimated from full history. These choices give the OR engine an empirically inferred lead time and a demand forecast that adapts moderately to recent changes while retaining historical variance for safety vs stockouts.

On-hand=0, in-transit=83 \u2014 pipeline sizeable but many past orders show mixed lead times (1 or 2). Observed lead times = {2,1,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,1}, avg \u22481.6 \u2192 use calculated average lead time to let backend adapt.

Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 4 (+23% higher). On-hand=0, in-transit=83 (pipeline provides cover but some shipments have varied lead times historically). Observed concluded lead times are mixed (1 and 2 periods) so I let backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). To capture the post-changepoint higher demand, I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility, using N=20 (covers the recent regime while respecting the regime-detection rule). These parameters bias the base-stock upward to improve service during the higher-demand regime while sigma recent_N captures recent variability; backend cap still limits order size to avoid excessive overstock given holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 19\u201323 = 4,5,12,21,13) shows a lower summer regime vs earlier weeks; use recent_N=5 to capture current mean and volatility. This keeps mu_hat aligned to current demand and avoids overstock given holding cost >0; sigma_hat recent_N=5 captures recent variability for safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=83. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1 and 2 periods); average lead time appears >1. Demand history shows a known regime shift starting Period 4 (higher mean P4-P6), but the most recent 5 weeks (P20-P24: 5,12,21,13,5) suggest a lower recent-demand regime. To balance service vs holding cost I set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate) so the backend averages concluded lead times. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the current lower 5-period demand profile, avoiding excess holding from using the older higher-demand data. This configuration helps the OR engine produce orders sized for near-term demand while the calculate L captures the mixed 1\u20132 period realized lead times.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=83. Historical concluded lead times vary (observed 1 and 2 periods); use calculated average lead time to let backend infer current effective L. Demand history shows an earlier documented regime shift (Period 4) to higher mean; recent on-hand stockouts produce many zero sales so recent samples are biased. Therefore use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so estimates rely on full historical record rather than recent censored observations. These settings aim to produce a balanced base-stock that considers the confirmed regime shift while avoiding overreaction to stockout-driven zeros; in-transit 83 will be counted by the OR engine as pipeline, reducing the order quantity.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand history shows a sustained higher regime since Period 4 (carry-over note). On-hand=0, in-transit=83 \u2014 some pipeline exists but many recent orders have not concluded, so use observed lead-time statistics rather than promised. Set L to 'calculate' (average of observed lead times ~1.625) to let backend infer actual average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend scales demand and volatility by (1+L) using all samples, balancing service level versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=83. Recent demand has been volatile with a sharp uptick in the last 5 periods (P23-P27 = 13,5,19,36,67). No concluded arrivals in P27 to revise lead-time; historical concluded lead-times vary (1\u20132). I keep L at the promised default (2) because concluded evidence is mixed and not a sustained shift. To capture the recent higher mean and volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the last 5 demand samples) so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock while reflecting elevated variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given the late large demands and 83 units in-transit) against holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 4 (carry-over insight). On-hand=0, in-transit=120 (sizable pipeline but arrival timing uncertain). Observed lead times vary (mix of 1 and 2); use calculated average lead time to let backend infer actual LT from concluded arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (regime length >20), reducing influence of early low-demand samples. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to avoid excessive holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has surged in Periods 26-29 (36,67,68,59) indicating a new high-demand regime vs earlier weeks. On-hand=0, in-transit=120 (provides partial coverage). No concluded evidence that actual lead time differs from promised (2), so retain promised lead time. Set L=default. Forecast demand using the most recent 4 weeks to capture the new regime: mu_hat recent_N N=4. Estimate volatility from the same recent window: sigma_hat recent_N N=4. These choices bias stock toward current high demand while avoiding assuming permanent longer lead time or overreacting to single-week noise.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=158 units (several recent arrivals observed with 1\u20132 period lead times). To respect observed variability in arrivals I let the backend compute average observed lead time (method=calculate). Recent weeks show a clear higher-demand regime (large demands in the last 5 concluded periods), so I set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 5 samples (recent_N, N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime and its variance. These choices reduce stockouts by sizing base stock to recent demand while keeping volatility estimated from recent data to avoid excessive holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=286. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 4 (already recorded). Several concluded arrivals show actual lead times of 1\u20132 periods; no new sustained LT shift confirmed. To capture the recent high-demand regime and avoid understocking given large in-transit but long-observed high demand, set L by calculating the average of observed lead times and set demand estimates using the most recent regime (to weight recent high demands). Chosen methods: L=calculate to reflect observed lead-time behavior; mu_hat=recent_N (N=20) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=20) to base the review+lead forecast on the last 20 demand samples, improving responsiveness to the higher-demand regime while letting the OR backend compute the scaled (1+L) factors and safety-stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 Period 33. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime increase beginning Period 4 (noted in carry-over). On-hand=10, in-transit=83 \u2014 pipeline sizable but some past orders had varying lead times (1\u20132 periods). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the average of observed lead times (captures the 1\u20132 variability). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to anchor the forecast on the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (last 20 samples) so mu_hat reflects current elevated demand; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=20 to measure volatility from the same recent window. This balances service (avoid stockouts during higher demand) against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=205 (pending arrivals from recent large orders). Observed actual lead times vary (1\u20132 periods); use calculated average lead time to let backend reconcile variability. Demand jumped sharply starting Period 28; to capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N=6 (Periods 28\u201333) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects current elevated demand and reduces stockouts while accepting higher holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Large, sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 28 (massive spike) \u2014 recent periods (28-34) show much higher demand than pre-shift, so use recent data for demand estimates. Set L to the calculated average of observed lead times to reflect actual behavior. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (regime length from Period 28-34 = 7) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to cover the new, higher-demand regime and balances service level (reduce lost sales) vs holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 28 (large spike through Period 35) and substantial in-transit stock (849) from recent large orders. Observed concluded lead times vary between 1\u20132 periods; I'll let the backend compute the average observed lead time (method=calculate). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (periods 30\u201335 data most relevant) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets reflect the elevated demand while the cap limits ordering. This balances service (avoid stockouts during the confirmed spike) against holding cost given large pipeline inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21. On-hand=120, in-transit=721 (large pipeline). Historical demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 28 (large spike through Period 36). Lead times have varied (mostly 1\u20132, one recent 3); not enough sustained evidence to change promised LT. I choose L via recent_N to emphasize recent observed LT variability (N=5). For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (Period 28 onward) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean/variance (N=9 = length of regime). These choices let the OR engine size base stock for the current higher-demand regime while keeping LT estimation responsive to recent arrivals; avoids overreacting to a single long LT observation.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 28 (large spike) and volatile lead times including one 3-period observation but not sustained. On-hand=0, in-transit=721 (large pipeline that likely covers several review+lead periods). I select L='calculate' to let backend use the average of all observed concluded lead times (captures mixed lead-time behavior without overreacting to a single 3-period sighting). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the post-regime-shift periods (Period 28+), which better represents current elevated demand while keeping estimation stable. No new carry-over insights to add.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=762 (large pipeline). Historical data shows a clear sustained demand regime shift starting Period 28 (very large weekly demand from P28 onward). I keep L as default (promised 2) because concluded arrivals show variable lead times but no sustained, consistent shift in lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture the elevated demand regime (Periods 28\u201338 \u2248 11 periods of the new regime). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and variability so the OR backend increases base stock to protect service level while cap still limits overly large single orders given pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=35, in-transit=654. Demand regime shift beginning Period 28 produced sustained high demand from P28\u2013P39; recent demand is from that high regime. Observed concluded lead times recently include two 3-period arrivals (order P33->arrived P36; order P36->arrived P39) alongside some 1\u20132 period arrivals. To be responsive to the elevated demand regime, set demand forecast using recent samples from the post-changepoint regime (Period 28 onward, 12 periods available). To account for the recent persistent longer shipments, estimate lead time from the most recent observed lead times (N=3) so the OR engine increases on-hand coverage. Sigma uses the same recent window as mu to reflect current volatility. These choices balance higher service-level needs during the high-demand regime while acknowledging increased lead-time risk and large in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (observed: order on Period 33 arrived Period 36; order on Period 36 arrived Period 39).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in a elevated regime since Period 28 (very large spike around P33). On-hand=0, in-transit=675 units. Historical concluded lead-time evidence (Periods 33->36 and 36->39) confirms actual lead time ~3. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime I set L explicitly to 3 and use recent_N=8 for demand mean/volatility (using the last 8 concluded demand samples P33\u2013P40) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand under the current high regime. This balances service (capture current high demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock; using recent samples keeps the base stock responsive to the confirmed demand shift.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent persistent high-demand regime began Period 28 (large spike; avg Period28-33 >> prior). On-hand=0, in-transit=1026 (large pipeline). Lead time previously confirmed as 3 periods (observed P33\u2192P36 and P36\u2192P39). To respect the confirmed LT and recent high-demand regime, set L explicitly=3. For demand forecast use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 28\u201341, 14 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher mean and volatility; this prevents underordering despite large pipeline and balances service level vs. holding cost given high pipeline volume.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 28 and confirmed lead time=3 (carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=1026 \u2014 large pipeline covers multiple periods but arrivals will be visible only after conclude messages. I set L explicit=3 to reflect observed actual lead time (orders observed arriving after 3 periods). Demand forecast uses recent_N with N=15 (Periods 28\u201342) to capture the sustained high-demand regime rather than diluting with earlier low-demand weeks. Volatility is likewise estimated from the same recent window (recent_N N=15) so the OR engine sets base-stock and caps using current high-traffic variability. These choices prioritize meeting the confirmed elevated demand while accounting for longer lead time and the substantial in-transit volume to avoid excessive new orders.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=349, in-transit=654. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 3 periods (sustained evidence P33->P36 and P36->P39). Recent demand has fallen from the large spike around Periods 28-33; last 7 periods (P37-P43) show lower, more stable demand. I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed lead time so the OR backend plans for the longer arrival. For demand I use recent_N over the last 7 periods to capture the post-spike lower regime for both mean and volatility, avoiding overweighting the earlier extreme spike. This balances service (protects against stockouts given L=3) while limiting holding cost by using a reduced recent demand forecast and volatility estimate.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 28 (large spike Sep onward) and multiple concluded arrivals indicating actual lead time = 3. On-hand=338, in-transit=654 (pipeline=992). With promised L=2 but confirmed actual L=3, I set L explicitly to 3 to avoid under-ordering. To capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the recent regime length (N=18 periods since Period 28). Using recent data for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the current high-demand volatility while the explicit longer L reduces stockouts from late arrivals. This balances a high target service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.8) against holding cost by forecasting from the recent high-demand regime and accounting for the longer observed lead time.

Actual lead time has been observed as 3 periods in concluded history (order P33\u2192arrived P36; order P36\u2192arrived P39), so I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid under-ordering. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (this captures the large post-P28 demand regime in the data), balancing service level against holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 Period 47. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 28 (large spike avg >> prior) and confirmed actual lead time = 3 periods (arrivals: P33->P36, P36->P39). Current inventory: on-hand=37, in-transit=654 (total pipeline=691) \u2014 ample cover vs. near-term demand but lead time is longer than promised so use that. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N=19 (the sustained high-demand regime from Period 28 through Period 46 is ~19 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime; matching demand-window for both mean and volatility keeps order targets aligned with observed surge and reduces understock risk despite high pipeline. This balances service level (high profit/holding ratio) while avoiding further stockouts given confirmed longer lead time.
