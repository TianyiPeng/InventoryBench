Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Demand recent samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show average ~120 units/week; no on-hand or in-transit stock and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Promised lead time (2) is used to avoid premature changes. Using default methods leverages all historical samples to set (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding so q=0.5, and prevents overreacting to limited history or potential shipment loss.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=158 from Period 1 order which has not concluded yet, so actual lead time is not confirmed. Demand sample series shows a recent uptick (last three weeks: 117, 123, 157). I keep L at promised value because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent upward demand regime while keeping estimates responsive. This balances service (higher forecast for recent spike) against holding cost given limited evidence of sustained change.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Promised lead time = 2. We have on-hand=0 and in-transit=331 (orders from P1+P2); P1/P2 orders have not yet concluded in the history available (only concludes through Period 2), so actual lead time cannot be inferred yet. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan 2019) show a stable baseline (mean \u2248120). No evidence of sustained demand or lead-time regime change (need \u22653 periods of confirmed shift). To avoid premature adjustments, use default lead time (promised=2) and default demand/volatility estimation so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to historical mean while the pipeline (331 units) covers upcoming arrival uncertainty; default settings avoid overreacting to possibly delayed but not-yet-confirmed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent demand elevated vs historical (Periods 1-3 demand = 150, 177, 164; historical Jan samples mean ~119). On-hand=0, in-transit=397 but no arrivals concluded for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (ordered 158,173,66; arrived=0 each), indicating promised L=2 is not matching reality\u2014shipments delayed or lost. I set L explicit=3 to conservatively account for observed delays. I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher recent demand (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 3 demands). I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals while keeping variability tied to recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-3 (158, 173, 66) have not arrived (arrived=0 across three consecutive conclude messages) \u2014 evidence of sustained shipment delay; treat actual lead time >2 (use 3) until further arrivals confirm otherwise.

562245018: ordered=186, arrived=173 units (ordered on Period 2, lead_time was 2 periods), starting on-hand inventory=173, demand=161, sold=161, ending on-hand inventory=12
Daily Profit: $161.00, Daily Holding Cost: $12.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $149.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concludes show inconsistent arrivals: Period 2 order (173) arrived in P4 (lead_time=2) but Periods 1 and 3 orders remain missing through P4, indicating at least some shipments are delayed beyond promised L=2. On-hand=12, in-transit=410 \u2014 pipeline is large but arrivals are unreliable. To be conservative vs. stockouts given ambiguous/partial late arrivals, set L explicitly to 3 (treat effective lead time as longer). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging historical weekly demand mean=119.8); this raises target base-stock to cover the longer coverage (L+1) while letting OR backend apply its service-level cap. This balances higher service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Possible sustained shipment delays: orders placed in Periods 1 and 3 have not arrived by Period 4 conclude; Period 2 arrived in P4 (lead_time=2) but missing arrivals for P1 (ordered=158) and P3 (ordered=66) across 3 consecutive conclude messages \u2014 treat effective lead time as 3 until further arrivals confirm otherwise.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand is well above historical 2019-Jan samples (recent demands: 150,177,164,161,152; mean=160.8). Multiple conclude messages show sustained shipment delays for early orders (P1-P3), so use an explicit longer lead time of 3 to cover delayed arrivals. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated recent mean over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service given delayed pipeline while sigma captures variability to set safety stock; using recent data helps trading off extra holding vs. lost sales under the confirmed delay.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods: orders placed in Periods 1-3 failed to arrive within promised 2 periods and were missing across 3 consecutive conclude messages (evidence across Periods 2-4 concludes).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concludes show multiple delayed/missing arrivals: orders from Periods 1-3 did not arrive within promised 2 periods, and subsequent concludes confirm sustained delay; on-hand=0, in-transit=510 (large pipeline). Given confirmed effective lead time=3, set L explicitly to 3. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples \u2014 this leverages full sample history while accounting for longer review+lead coverage. This balances service (longer coverage with L=3) against holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1) by letting the OR engine compute the z* tradeoff.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=564. Historical concludes show sustained delays: orders placed in Periods 1-3 missed promised 2-period window and previous carry-over concluded actual lead time=3; treat L=3 to cover observed delays. Demand recently elevated with one large spike (Period 7=366) but the 5 most recent periods (P3\u2013P7) better capture the near-term regime. Set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect latest mean demand, and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to protect against stockouts given delayed shipments while limiting exposure by using recent sample stats rather than all-time averages.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): demand has been volatile with recent large spikes (Period 7 demand=366). On-hand=0, in-transit=639 \u2014 substantial pipeline but many prior orders were delayed; concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 3 (orders from P1-P3 missing through multiple concludes, and later arrivals imply variable lead times). To account for confirmed extended lead time, set L explicit=3 so the OR backend sizes safety and review+lead demand over 4 periods. Use default demand/statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it incorporate long-run historical mean/variance while the explicit L captures the sustained shipping delay. This balances service (higher cover for longer lead time) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=663. History shows sustained delayed/lost arrivals early (P1,P3 missing across multiple concludes) and subsequent variability in arrival times. Given the multi-period evidence earlier, treat effective lead time as 3 to be conservative. Demand has shifted up from the initial 2019 samples; I use the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 5-9: 152,148,366,235,160) to capture the current higher/volatile regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. These choices (L=3, recent demand window N=5) raise target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of service while letting sigma reflect recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost under uncertain arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concludes show multiple orders (Periods 1-3) missing beyond promised L=2 and a sustained pattern of arrivals lagging by one extra period; on-hand=105, in-transit=596 so pipeline is large but delayed. To protect service versus observed delays I set L explicit=3 (effective lead time = 3). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat = default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples using L=3; this raises target base-stock to cover the longer review+lead horizon while sigma scales similarly to capture uncertainty. This balances higher service needs (due to delayed arrivals) against holding cost given profit=holding so critical fractile is 0.5.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods: orders placed in Periods 1-3 failed to arrive within promised 2 periods and were missing across at least 3 consecutive conclude messages (evidence: P1 ordered=158 arrived=0 across concludes; P2 ordered=173 arrived in P4 => lead_time=2 for P2 but P1,P3 missing; sustained delays observed across Periods 2-4 concludes).

Demand has shifted up beginning Period 7 (demands: P7\u2013P11 = 366,235,160,148,152); I treat this as the new regime and use the most recent 5 periods to forecast demand across the review+lead window. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed delays so the OR engine computes base stock for (1+L) periods. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint mean and volatility, ensuring orders cover the higher recent demand and the longer effective lead time while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=849. Concluded history shows sustained delays: multiple orders (Periods 1-3) failed to arrive within promised 2 periods and confirms effective lead time = 3. To cover review+lead demand I set L explicit=3. Recent demand has shifted up vs early-sample weeks; I use recent_N=5 (Periods 8-12 demands = 235,160,148,152,157) to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean for mu_hat and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat so the OR engine adapts to the current higher regime while avoiding overreacting to single spikes. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given longer lead time and recent elevated demand) against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: orders placed in Periods 1-3 failed to arrive within promised 2 periods and were missing across at least 3 consecutive conclude messages; sustained delays observed across Periods 2-4 concludes).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=849. Historical concluded arrivals show sustained delays earlier; given current evidence I treat effective lead time as 3 periods. Demand recently is elevated (most recent 5 concluded demands = 160,148,152,157,143 \u2192 mean \u2248152). To cover review+lead horizon (1+L=4) I use a recent_N forecast based on the last 5 samples for mu_hat and recent_N for sigma_hat to capture the current higher mean and volatility. This increases target base_stock to protect service level given overdue/lost shipments while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap rule.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=142, in-transit=596. Historical concludes show sustained delayed arrivals earlier and lead time confirmed as 3 periods (orders from P1-P3 failed to arrive within promised 2 and were missing across \u22653 concludes). To protect service while accounting for confirmed longer lead time I set L explicitly=3. Demand has shifted up recently (recent weeks demands: P10-14 = 148,152,157,143,111 \u2192 mean \u2248142); therefore I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand on the latest regime. I keep sigma_hat as default to let the backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices raise the base-stock to cover the longer effective lead time and recent higher demand while using default volatility to avoid underestimating uncertainty given past spikes and missing arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=46, in-transit=596. Historical concludes show sustained shipment delays earlier (orders from P1-P3 missing across multiple concludes) and recent confirms of longer lead time. To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost, I set lead time to 3 (explicit). Demand shows a recent regime around Periods 10-15 (demands: 148,152,157,143,111,96); I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 6 samples, capturing the current demand level and volatility. This balances higher coverage for the longer effective lead time with up-to-date demand estimates.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: orders placed in Periods 1-3 failed to arrive within promised 2 periods and were missing across \u22653 consecutive conclude messages; sustained delays observed in Periods 2-4 concludes).

Historical conclude messages show sustained delayed arrivals (orders from P1-P3 missing across \u22653 consecutive concludes) \u2014 effective lead time observed = 3. To cover review+lead demand while avoiding excess holding given Profit=Holding, I set L explicitly to 3. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (most recent weeks show lower demand than early spikes) so the OR backend targets a base-stock reflecting current demand and the longer lead time, while recent volatility informs safety stock sizing.

On-hand=0, in-transit=596 (many periods of pipeline with mixed arrival behavior). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time so the OR engine plans for a 3-period transit. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples using the chosen L=3; this increases protection (larger review+lead demand) against stockouts given confirmed delays while letting the OR engine apply its capped ordering to limit excess inventory.

Historical concludes show sustained delayed arrivals earlier and user-provided carry-over indicates effective lead time=3; I set L=3 to reflect confirmed extended lead time and avoid under-ordering. Recent demand has settled below earlier peaks (most recent demands: P14-18 = 111,96,64,59,55) \u2014 I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower-demand regime across the (1+L) review+lead window. This balances service level (longer lead time requires larger (1+L) coverage) against holding costs by basing forecasts on the latest stable five periods rather than all historical high-volume periods.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=0, in-transit=596 (covers multiple periods but arrivals observed with lag). Demand has downshifted from early spikes; use a recent-window forecast to capture current lower regime while avoiding older high outliers (e.g., 366). Chosen parameters: L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed sustained delays; mu_hat recent_N N=8 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 8 demand samples (captures current lower-demand regime and excludes older extremes); sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce stockouts given longer effective lead time while limiting excess holding from older high-demand periods.

Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=596. Historical conclues show sustained delayed arrivals earlier; effective lead time remains longer than promised. I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed/ongoing 3-period effective lead time. Demand has trended down in recent weeks (Periods 15-20: 96,64,59,55,57,33); I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, capturing the recent lower demand regime and reducing excess inventory risk given high in-transit. This balances service (covering L+1 periods) while avoiding extra holding cost against the large in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=596. Historical conclude messages show sustained delayed arrivals; multiple orders missed the promised 2-period window. I therefore treat effective lead time as 3 to cover delayed shipments. Demand has fallen in recent weeks (Periods 17-21 demand = 59,55,57,33,24; recent mean \u224845). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the most recent low-demand regime. This raises the pipeline cover for the longer observed lead time while keeping forecasted demand and safety stock aligned to the recent lower demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given Profit=Holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has declined materially (last 6 demands: 59,55,57,33,24,41) versus earlier higher peaks; on-hand=0, in-transit=596 (pipeline large). Historical conclues have confirmed effective lead time = 3 periods (sustained missing arrivals). To avoid under-ordering given confirmed longer lead time, I set L explicitly to 3. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current lower-demand regime for (1+L)-period demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep the OR backend's base-stock tied to current low demand while the explicit L accounts for the sustained shipment delay and prevents stockouts caused by underestimated lead time, balancing service level and holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has dropped vs. early-year samples (last 5 demands P19-P23 = 57,33,24,41,63; mean=43.6) indicating a new low-demand regime vs. the Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=596 (large pipeline). Historical concludes show sustained shipment delays earlier; actual lead time has been confirmed as 3 periods\u2014use explicit L=3 to reflect observed delays. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent low-demand regime over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match lower current demand while recognizing longer effective lead time and large in-transit pipeline, balancing service vs. holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=596. Historical concludes (Periods 2-4 and later) show sustained shipment delays; evidence supports actual lead time = 3 (orders often miss promised 2-period arrival). With profit=holding, service-level quantile = 0.5 so backend uses mu/sigma; choose L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time and avoid under-ordering. Use mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)*mean over all samples (captures baseline demand scaled to 4-period review+lead). Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples (captures aggregated demand variability). This balances higher safety stock for delayed arrivals versus holding cost; large in-transit (596) already provides buffer but explicit L=3 ensures orders account for the observed sustained 3-period lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=596. Historical concludes show sustained shipment delays; effective lead time is longer than promised. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed 3-period arrivals. Recent demand (Periods 17-25 = 59,55,57,33,24,41,63,45,45) indicates a lower demand regime; use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean and variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=596. Historical conclude messages (Periods 4\u201316 and carry-over) show sustained missing arrivals; actual lead time treated as 3 periods. Demand has been low-recent (Periods 22\u201326: 41,63,45,45,54). I set L explicit=3 to capture confirmed longer lead time so pipeline coverage uses (1+L)=4 review+lead periods. I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility on the most recent regime (last 5 weeks), keeping safety appropriate given equal profit and holding cost (z balances service vs holding). This increases order-up-to to meet 4-period demand under the observed recent demand level while reflecting recent variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=596. Historical concludes show sustained delayed arrivals; effective lead time treated as 3. Recent demand since Period 7 is much lower than early spikes (stable low-demand regime). Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed sustained delays. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent stable regime of demand, keeping orders aligned with current low demand and long lead time. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility rather than older high-variance samples. This reduces overordering given holding cost=profit and large in-transit balance.

I set L explicit=3 to force the OR engine to plan for the longer realized lead time. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a conservative replenishment level that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost under the longer lead time and existing pipeline of 596 units.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (Periods 21-29 mean \u224844 units/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=596 units (well above (1+L)*mean), so pipeline currently sufficient and no emergency replenishment needed. Historical conclude messages show sustained delayed arrivals earlier (multiple orders missing beyond promised 2 periods); treat effective lead time as 3 to be conservative. Therefore: set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9, using the last 9 demand samples from Periods 21-29) to capture the current low-demand regime and recent volatility. These settings reduce over-ordering under the longer lead time while using recent demand to keep forecasts responsive.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent concluded history shows long stretch of low weekly demand since Period 17 (59,55,57,33,24,41,63,45,45,54,53,37,35,33) indicating a persistent lower-demand regime vs. earlier spring peaks. Multiple prior conclude messages confirm effective lead time = 3 (orders placed earlier failed to arrive within promised 2 periods). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect the confirmed extended lead time. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=14) to capture the current low-demand regime (Periods 17\u201330) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 14 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(last 14 samples) (backend will compute). This keeps target base stock aligned to current lower demand while the larger L accounts for delayed arrivals and avoids stockouts from underestimated pipeline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has settled at a much lower regime (Periods 22-31: demands mostly 24\u201363, recent 10 periods average ~44) while on-hand=0 and in-transit=596. Historical conclude messages previously confirmed sustained shipment delays (effective lead time = 3). I set L explicit=3 to reflect the confirmed longer lead time so the OR backend will plan across the correct pipeline. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the new, lower-demand regime (reduces over-ordering given high in-transit and equal profit/holding cost). This balances service (accounting for L=3) against holding cost by using a short recent window to lower mean and volatility estimates.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent weeks show nonzero demand (latest week 101) but on-hand=0 and in-transit=596. Historical conclude messages (Periods 2-4 and multiple later concludes) provide sustained evidence that actual lead time has been 3 periods (orders placed failed to arrive within promised 2 and were missing across \u22653 consecutive concludes). To protect service while avoiding excessive holding, I set L explicitly to 3 to have the OR backend size orders for a longer effective pipeline. I use default demand/volatility calculations so the backend will compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples), which balances service level and holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1) implying q=0.5 (neutral z). This preserves robustness to demand variability while accounting for confirmed longer lead time and the large in-transit quantity.

Historical conclude messages (Periods 2-4 and subsequent concludes) show multiple orders missing at promised L=2 and pattern of arrivals consistent with effective lead time = 3; current on-hand=0, in-transit=596 which exceeds (1+L)\xd7historical mean demand. Set L explicit=3 to reflect observed sustained delay. Use mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasts anchored to full-sample demand while the explicit L accounts for delayed arrivals and avoids unnecessary extra ordering given large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has picked up (last 3 weeks: 101, 254, 175) and on-hand=0 with in-transit=596. Historical concludes confirm effective lead time = 3 (multiple periods with promised L=2 shipments missing and prior concludes showing delays). To reflect confirmed longer lead time and capture elevated recent demand, set L explicitly to 3 and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent regime. This ensures the OR backend sizes the review+lead demand forecast for (1+L) periods with recent demand signal while capping orders via its cap rule to limit excess holding cost given profit=holding cost.

To cover review+lead (1+L=4) periods and respond to the higher recent demand, I set L explicitly to 3 and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility; this balances higher target base-stock to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals while relying on recent variability to limit excessive holding.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: orders placed in Periods 1-3 failed to arrive within promised 2 periods and were missing across \u22653 consecutive conclude messages; sustained delays documented across Periods 2-4 concludes and reiterated in later periods).

Recent demand has risen since Period 32 (demands: 101,254,175,159,124) \u2014 adopt a short recent-window forecast to capture elevated demand. Set L explicitly to 3 to account for observed delays so the OR backend sizes pipeline correctly.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=651. Historical concludes show sustained delayed arrivals earlier; treat effective lead time as 3 to cover overdue shipments and in-transit. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed longer lead time. Demand has jumped recently (periods 33-37: 254,175,159,124,100) so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current high-demand regime; this raises the (1+L)-period demand estimate and the safety stock to avoid stockouts given longer lead time while balancing holding cost because profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=600. Historical concludes (Periods 2-4 and reiterated later) confirm sustained shipment delays with effective lead time = 3 periods; in-transit volume is large (600) so pipeline coverage is substantial but arrivals have lagged historically. I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed effective lead time. Demand has shifted higher since late Sep (Periods 32-38 show elevated weekly demand: 101,254,175,159,124,100,187); to capture the recent regime I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the most recent elevated demand samples. This balances higher service needs (due to recent spikes) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=0, in-transit=625. Historical concludes show repeated multi-period delays and multiple confirms that realized lead time = 3 (orders from P1\u2013P3 missing across \u22653 concludes; recent P39 conclude shows an arrival with lead_time=3). To handle sustained delay I set L explicitly to 3. I use default demand sizing (mu_hat: default) and default volatility (sigma_hat: default) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this keeps the base-stock scaled for the longer review+lead period while letting the backend cap orders per its service/holding tradeoff.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent concluded history shows multiple sustained shipment delays and at least one clear 3-period arrival (Order in P36 arrived in P39 => lead_time=3). On-hand=0, in-transit=625. I set lead time to 3 to reflect observed sustained delays. Recent demand (Periods 36-40 = 124,100,187,109,132) averages 130.4; using (1+L)=4 gives a 4-period demand forecast \u2248 521.6, rounded to 522. Demand volatility (sample std \u224834.0 scaled by sqrt(4)) \u224868.0. These explicit choices ensure the OR backend targets coverage of the longer effective pipeline while accounting for recent demand level and higher variability to balance service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: order placed P36 arrived in P39 => lead_time=3; multiple earlier orders missing within promised 2 periods across \u22653 consecutive conclude messages).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=596. Historical concludes show sustained shipment delays with arrivals consistent with a 3-period actual lead time (e.g., order P36 arrived in P39 => lead_time=3; multiple earlier orders missed promised 2-period window). I set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed effective lead time. Recent demand (Periods 37-41: 100,187,109,132,122) is materially higher than early-period samples and reflects current regime; I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility are driven by these five latest observations. This raises the base-stock to cover the longer lead time and recent elevated demand, prioritizing service given profit and holding costs are equal and the high risk of stockouts if underordered.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: order placed in Period 36 arrived in Period 39; multiple orders failed to arrive within promised 2 periods across at least 3 consecutive conclude messages).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent concludes show a confirmed lead time = 3 (e.g., order in P36 arrived in P39). Period 42 shows a large demand spike (1007) \u2014 likely a sustained high-demand event. To cover the elevated short-term demand over the review+lead window (1+L periods = 4), I set L explicit=3. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 4 observed demands (Periods 39-42 = 109,132,122,1007) to capture the recent regime and volatility so the OR backend raises the base stock to meet the spike while accounting for higher variability.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent concludes show confirmed extended lead time = 3 (evidence: orders arriving with 3-period lag: P36->P39 arrived=4; multiple earlier shipments missed promised 2-period window). On-hand=0, in-transit=1370, and recent demand has spiked (Periods 39-43 demands: 109,132,122,1007,771) \u2014 a clear recent regime shift. Set L explicitly to 3 to reflect observed deliveries and avoid expecting arrivals too early. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime across the last 5 observed demand samples (so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a higher base-stock to meet the sustained spike while accounting for the longer effective lead time and higher variability; they also guard against lost/delayed shipments by not relying on the promised lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). History shows sustained shipment delays with multiple orders missing promised 2-period arrivals and confirmed arrivals consistent with a 3-period lead time (e.g., order P36 arrived in P39). On-hand=0, in-transit=1713. Recent demand shows a strong holiday spike (Period 42-44: 1007, 771, 88). I set L explicitly to 3 to reflect confirmed effective lead time and avoid under-ordering. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent holiday regime while keeping smoothing; same N for sigma to capture increased recent volatility. This balances service (covering the L+1 review+lead window given higher recent demand) versus holding cost by focusing the forecast on recent demand rather than long-run low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 3 periods (evidence: order placed in Period 36 arrived in Period 39; multiple earlier orders failed to arrive within promised 2 periods across \u22653 consecutive conclude messages).

On-hand=697, in-transit=939 (large pipeline). Set L explicit=3 to reflect confirmed effective lead time and avoid underordering. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (including the recent large spike) so the OR backend computes base_stock and caps using up-to-date mean/volatility across the review+lead window.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent concludes show actual lead time = 3 (e.g., order placed P36 arrived in P39 => lead_time 3) and multiple earlier periods showed delayed arrivals; on-hand=645 and in-transit=1246 are large but recent demand spiked (P42=1007, P43=771) consistent with holiday peak. To protect against sustained 3-period delays use explicit L=3. Forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the holiday spike (recent_N N=5) for mu_hat and reflect recent volatility with sigma_hat recent_N N=5. These settings raise target base-stock to cover the longer effective lead time and recent high demand while the capped order cap will limit extreme over-ordering given inventory on hand.
