Historical demand: weekly samples show 96, 105, 130, 150 (rising through January) then a drop to 58 on 2019-02-04 (likely anomaly or stockout effect). Baseline recent mean excluding the 58 anomaly \u2248 (96+105+130+150)/4 = 120. Largely upward January trend and imminent holiday imply current-week demand at-or-above the 150 level; use a conservative blended estimate \u2248 120\u2013150/week. Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time = 2 periods; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Per instructions, order + on-hand + in-transit should cover (L+1)=3 periods of demand because arrivals occur after decision and will not help current period. Order logic: cover 3 weeks of demand to capture the Valentine spike and immediate post-event demand. Using 3 \xd7 120 = 360 units (balances service vs holding cost given strong holiday signal and zero current inventory).",

Demand regime: recent baseline before spike was low (~30/week), but current short window suggests elevated holiday demand; single large week (232) may be a short-term spike. Lead time & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=460 units. Promised lead time=2; past evidence shows actual lead time has been 1\u20132 but current in-transit is reported by system so treat as available future supply (arrivals will resolve in upcoming periods). Decision logic: target coverage = (L+1)=3 weeks of expected demand. Using a conservative holiday forecast of 150/week implies target = 450 units; in-transit 460 already meets/exceeds this. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) but ordering extra risks excess post-holiday holding. Therefore place no additional order this period and rely on in-transit supply to meet near-term elevated demand; monitor arrivals next conclude to confirm lead time and adjust if needed.",

Demand analysis: Recent concluded weeks (P42\u2013P45) = 68, 98, 232, 176 \u2014 three consecutive high-demand weeks (P43\u2013P45) average = 168.7/week, much higher than prior short-term baselines. Lead time & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=460. Most recently observed reliable lead_time = 2 periods (earlier confirmed) though occasional 1-period arrivals occurred; no evidence that the in-transit 460 will be lost. Risk tradeoff: Orders placed now will arrive in P48 (after two periods). Given large pipeline (460) likely to arrive and cover imminent holiday demand spikes, placing additional stock risks excess holding cost after holidays. Final decision: do not order this period and rely on in-transit supply to cover near-term demand; monitor actual arrival in conclude messages to update lead-time/pipeline assumptions.",

Demand analysis: Periods 42\u201346 = 68,98,232,176,151 with Periods 43\u201346 avg = 164.25/week; this extends the previously identified holiday spike (Periods 43\u201345). Lead time / pipeline: Promised LT=2 and past evidence shows LT=2 (Period6\u21928). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=460. Inventory policy: Need coverage for L+1=3 periods. Using a conservative holiday-week forecast ~150/week implies 3-period coverage = 450 units. In-transit 460 already covers this. Ordering more would raise holding cost ($1/unit/period) while pipeline appears sufficient.
