Last 3 weeks average = (10+12+16)/3 = 12.7 units/week \u2014 indicates a lower, stable regime around 12\u201316 units. c) Lead time / missing orders: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; supplier promised 0 but actual lead time unknown \u2014 treat as potentially >=0 and plan conservatively for one-period demand. d) Inventory & pipeline assessment: no inventory or pipeline; holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit implies moderate penalty for overstock. e) Final order logic: target meeting one upcoming-week demand with small safety buffer. Forecast ~13 units; add a small buffer (+2) to protect service given lead-time uncertainty. Order = 15 units.",

Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision logic: because lead_time can be 0 (so same-period arrivals can meet this period's demand) and lost sales are costly (foregone profit $4/unit), order enough to cover a conservative positive demand forecast between the long-run mean (~19) and the observed spike (46).
