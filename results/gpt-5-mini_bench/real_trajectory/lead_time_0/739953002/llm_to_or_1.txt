Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent observed weekly demand samples: [0,0,14,47,29] \u2192 sample mean 18 units/week and sample std \u224818.0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lead-time deviation or lost shipments. Promised lead time = 0; insufficient evidence to change. Use default lead time and default demand stats so OR backend uses (1+L)*mean=18 and sqrt(1+L)*std\u224818 to balance service level (profit$4 vs hold$1 gives moderate fill target) while avoiding excess holding given sparse history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=19, in-transit=0, recent concluded history shows Period1 order (35) arrived in Period1 (lead_time=0) and demand in that period was 16. No evidence of delayed or lost shipments yet. I set L by calculating average observed lead times (calculate) which equals 0 based on observed conclusion. I use default demand estimates (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean of all historical samples and sqrt(1+L)*std respectively, keeping forecasts anchored to the full sample set while the lead time estimate is short and confirmed. This balances service level (maintain coverage) vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Recent concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 for Periods 1\u20132 (ordered and arrived same period). No overdue/lost shipments observed. I select L by 'calculate' to use the observed lead-time average (confirmed 0 so far). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all available historical samples, balancing service level and holding cost given stable demand history and current inventory.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3 conclude) = 16, 23, 12; on-hand=21, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Observed lead times in concludes are consistently 0 periods, so set L via calculate to reflect observed reality. Demand appears stable recently, so forecast (1+L)\xd7mean using the last 3 periods to capture current regime (N=3). Volatility likewise computed from the last 3 samples to match recent variability. These settings keep target base-stock responsive to recent demand while avoiding excess holding given H=1 and profit=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 (Periods 1-4 concluded). Demand history (concluded): 16, 23, 12, 42 \u2014 a single high week (P4) but not a sustained regime change (needs 3+ periods). Profit/holding implies high service level (q=0.8). I therefore set L to the observed average lead time (calculate) = 0, and use default demand/statistics so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed by the backend from all samples; this avoids overreacting to the single spike while letting the OR engine target a high service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows every observed order (P1-P5) had lead_time=0 => actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand (periods 1-5) = [16,23,12,42,45], mean=27.6, which is materially higher than earlier historical mean (~18.0). To reflect the confirmed 0 lead time and the recent upward demand regime, set L by calculation of observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new regime while limiting noise. This increases target base-stock to improve service given lost stockouts seen in P4-P5, while sigma recent_N gives volatility for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-5: avg increased from 18.0 to 27.6 (+53%)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows consistent zero lead time (orders from P1\u2013P6 all arrived with lead_time=0) and a sustained demand increase. Historical sample mean (2019-01-07..02-04)=18; recent realized weekly demand (Periods 2\u20136) elevated (23,12,42,45,44) \u2014 last 5-period mean ~33.2, last 3-period mean ~43.7. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=$4, holding=$1 -> target service quantile high), I keep L=default (promised lead time = 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals) and use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the new higher regime while avoiding overreacting to the very latest spike. I select N=5 to capture the elevated but not overly noisy regime (uses last 5 demand samples). Sigma_hat also set recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This gives the OR engine a forecast reflecting the recent demand regime and confirmed lead time, improving fill rates while limiting excess holding.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders in Periods 1-7 arrived same period) so I use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time=0. Demand has recently increased and I rely on the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 3-7: 12,42,45,44,56) to capture the new higher regime for both forecast mean and volatility; thus use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. No overdue or lost shipments observed. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward higher safety stock to reduce stockouts given rising demand while accepting modest holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 -> use averaged observed lead time (calculate). Demand has shifted up recently: last 3 concluded demands = 44,56,81; I treat this as a new higher-demand regime and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock reflects the current spike and balances service vs holding cost. recent_N=3 captures the most recent sustained increase while keeping N minimal per changepoint rules.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 6-8: avg increased from 27.6 to 60.33 (+118%), last 3 demands = [44,56,81].

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/15 (Period 10). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times = 0 for all past orders => actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand has risen recently versus early history; most recent three demands (Periods 7-9) = [56,81,41], supporting a higher short-run forecast. To balance service (profit=$4 vs holding=$1) and avoid stockouts given zero lead time, I use a short recent-window forecast (N=3) so mu_hat reflects the latest regime while sigma_hat captures recent variability. L uses promised lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded orders: lead_time=0), so use promised/default L. Recent demand has been elevated compared with early periods; use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the higher recent mean/volatility. Selected N=5 (periods 6-10: demands = [44,56,81,41,40]) to smooth the short spike while reflecting elevated demand. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given no pipeline inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Demand has clearly shifted upward since early periods (notable regime changes at P6 and P9). Recent demand (Periods 7-11 = [56,81,41,40,28], mean=49.2) best reflects current demand regime, so use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean and volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher recent demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $4.

=== Period 12 Summary ===
739953002: ordered=28, arrived=28 units (ordered on Period 12, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=67, demand=43, sold=43, ending on-hand inventory=24

Daily Reward (R_t): $148.00

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 9-12) = [41,40,28,43], recent mean ~38 units/period. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I therefore keep L = default (promised 0). To capture the recent demand regime (last 4 weeks) I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean ~38. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting current higher demand while limiting excess holding (profit $4 vs holding $1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods consistently, so use promised lead time (default). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 9; recent demands (Periods 9-13 = [41,40,28,43,42]) average ~38.8 units/week. To target service for the current regime while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat using a recent_N=5 (captures the post-Period-9 regime). Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20. Recent demand has settled at a higher regime (~40/wk): last 4 demands = [28,43,42,47], mean=40. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover next period. All observed lead times have been 0 (orders arrived same period). Set L=default to use promised lead time=0. Use mu_hat recent_N N=4 to target the most recent stable mean (1+L)*mean \u224840. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility (std \u22488.29) so the backend sizes safety stock to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand remains elevated: last 3 demands = [42,47,52] (avg=47). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently. To target service while limiting holding cost, use L=default (promised 0). Forecast demand using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples). Use sigma recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the base stock to meet current weekly demand while avoiding overstating variability from older low-demand periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand regime is the higher level established since Period 9; last 3 demands = [47,52,44] (avg \u2248 47.7). On-hand=8, in-transit=0 so current coverage is very low vs expected single-period demand. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so use promised lead time. Set L=default. Set mu_hat based on recent_N (N=3) to reflect the current elevated demand regime. Set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture short-run volatility from the same recent sample. These choicesbias orders toward meeting current higher demand while avoiding overcommitment from older low-demand periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has moderated after earlier spikes; last 5 demands = [42,47,52,44,27], mean \u224842.4, std \u22489.4. To reflect the most recent regime while keeping responsiveness, set L=default (0), mu_hat using recent 5-sample mean (1+L)*mean, and sigma_hat using recent 5-sample std. This balances service level (high profit/low holding cost ratio \u2192 target high fill) with avoiding excessive inventory given the recent dip to 27.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Demand history (Periods 1\u201318) shows elevated recent demand but previous carry-over already noted regime shifts; no new sustained changepoint meeting 3+ period threshold beyond those recorded. Promised lead time remains appropriate. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand and volatility I select default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the backend compute base-stock and the capped order given known profit/holding tradeoff. This balances service level (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.8) against holding cost while relying on full-sample statistics given no new sustained pattern to record.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has moderated from earlier spikes; last 5 demands (Periods 15-19) = [52,44,27,43,30], mean=39.2. To adapt to recent regime while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so base-stock reflects current demand; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent variability. This balances service level (captures recent higher mean vs older data) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 keep L=default (promised=0). Recent demand has trended down from the April/May peak; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 16-20) = [44,27,43,30,22], mean \u224833.2 and moderate variability. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets a base stock reflecting the most recent regime and avoids overstocking from earlier peak weeks. This balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost by using recent demand to set service level while keeping holding exposure low given no in-transit protection.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8. On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 19-21) = [30, 22, 25], suggesting a near-term mean ~25.7 and low recent volatility; no strong new sustained regime shift. To focus orders on the most recent demand level while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods (N=3). This keeps the base-stock responsive to the current demand run-rate and reduces overstock risk given low pipeline.

Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 historically (orders in each conclude arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (last weeks) shows variability but no new sustained regime change beyond previously recorded shifts; therefore use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Profit/holding implies q=0.8 (high service preference), backend will set safety stock via z. This balances service level vs holding cost while avoiding overfitting short recent fluctuations.

Recent demand has risen in the last 3 periods (Periods 21-23 demands = [25,33,42], recent mean \u224833.3) indicating a sustained uptick versus older samples; to react quickly I use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory for the new higher-demand regime while profit/holding tradeoff is handled by backend z* calculation (q=4/(4+1)=0.8).

Date 2019/7/29. Recent demand (Periods 20-24) = [22,25,33,42,24], on-hand=17, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so keep L = promised (default). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current July demand level and variability (avoids diluting with early-year low samples). This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher recent mean while sigma from recent data sets safety stock to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = [25,33,42,24,41]) shows elevated but variable demand; mean \u224833 units, std \u22487.6. To be responsive to the most recent regime while avoiding overweighting older data, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility. Keep L as default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals.

Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand has been elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: [33,42,24,41,61]) so use recent-window statistics to reflect current regime. Keep L as default (promised lead time = 0; historical concluded lead times are 0). Choose mu_hat recent_N and sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent pattern, improving service for higher recent demand while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Recent demand shows elevated and volatile demand, with last 5 demands = [42,24,41,61,118] (avg=57.2) reflecting a recent higher regime but still variable. I keep L=default to rely on promised/observed lead time=0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent upward shift while smoothing one-off spikes. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent increased volatility. These parameters bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given high recent demand while keeping holding cost in check.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 26-28 = [61,118,39]) shows a short sustained upward regime across 3 periods; to react quickly I use a 3-period recent estimate for demand mean and volatility so base-stock reflects the recent spike while keeping lead time = 0. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) vs holding cost by not up-weighting older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 26-28: avg increased to 72.67 (periods 26-28 = [61,118,39], avg 72.67) \u2014 record based on 3 consecutive higher-demand periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=46, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times = 0 each period, so keep L = promised (default). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime (Periods 26-29 avg \u224872.7 with last 3 demands [61,118,39]/[27-29 evidence) \u2014 use recent_N=3 to capture the new higher mean and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead demand forecast. This increases service for elevated demand while the backend caps orders via its cap parameter to limit excess holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand remains elevated vs early history (last demands: Period28=39, Period29=61, Period30=67) indicating a higher-demand regime but with volatility. On-hand=40, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded lead_times = 0), so keep L=default to let backend use promised lead time. For demand forecast, use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 28-30) so mu_hat reflects current higher mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility and avoid underestimating risk. These settings prioritize meeting current elevated demand while limiting excess holding cost by focusing on short recent history.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 keep L as default (promised 0). Recent demand has shifted upward; last 3 observed demands = [61, 67, 80] (Periods 29-31) average \u224869.33. To capture the recent higher regime while remaining responsive to potential volatility, set mu_hat using recent_N N=3. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 (service level tradeoff embedded in OR engine). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so orders will replenish immediately under lead time 0.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand has been elevated vs earlier history; last 3 concluded demands = [67,80,60] (mean ~69). On-hand=18, in-transit=0 so we are somewhat exposed to stockouts this period. All observed lead times remain 0 (orders historically arrive same period). I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0) given consistent evidence. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to focus the base-stock on the most recent higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean \u224869 units). I choose sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility (std \u224810).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has jumped: Periods 31-33 = [80,60,135] and Periods 29-33 = [61,67,80,60,135], indicating a new higher-demand regime. To quickly adapt the base-stock to the higher recent demand while keeping variability responsive, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent 5-week average and volatility (weights the large recent spike but smooths single-period noise). This increases target base stock to cover the new demand level while sigma_hat from recent data raises safety stock to protect service without excessive long-term holding.

To capture the most recent demand regime and volatility while keeping lead time as observed, I set L=default (promised/observed 0). I use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the last 6 observed weekly demands (Periods 31-36 = [80,60,135,70,57,50]), which balances responsiveness to the recent spike and smoothing across subsequent weeks. This helps the OR backend produce a base-stock that defends service level during elevated demand while using recent volatility to size the cap and avoid excessive holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep L as default (promised). Recent demand has shown multiple regime shifts earlier, but the most recent 7 periods (P31-P37 demands = [80,60,135,70,57,50,33]) capture the current post-peak behavior and short-term variability better than the full history. Using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat yields a forecast and volatility that reflect current demand levels while the default L keeps pipeline timing aligned with supplier promise. This balances service (avoid stockouts after high recent demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory and zero in-transit units.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Observed lead times have been consistently 0 in concluded history so use L default. Demand recently shows elevated and variable weekly sales; last 5 demands (Periods 34-38) = [70,57,50,33,83], mean=58.6. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the latest regime while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by using a short, recent window to keep stock adequate for near-term demand without excessive holding.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand has been elevated and variable; last 5 demands (Periods 35-39) = [57,50,33,83,54], mean ~55.4. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms it. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher, volatile regime while keeping responsiveness to changes. This biases the OR base-stock toward current demand levels (improves service) while recent-based volatility informs safety stock to control holding cost tradeoff.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand shows a higher regime vs early history: last 5 demands (Periods 37-41) = [33,83,54,42,31], mean=48.6; earlier regime averages were lower but several regime shifts were recorded (Periods 31-34 upward). To balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) and avoid stockouts given elevated recent demand, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures current elevated mean). Volatility also appears elevated; use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 so the backend sizes safety stock to recent variability. This keeps orders responsive to the recent higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding costs given current on-hand=38 and no pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Last concluded period (P42) shows an extreme spike (demand=315) likely Black Friday/seasonal surge; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical lead times have consistently concluded as 0, so keep L as default (promised 0). To balance capturing the recent surge while limiting overreaction to a single massive outlier, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (includes the last 5 demands [83,54,42,31,315], giving a robust short-window forecast that weights the surge). This raises target base-stock to cover near-term elevated demand and the capped order will limit extreme ordering given holding cost. No evidence of a sustained lead-time change or persistent regime beyond the seasonal spike, so no carry-over insight recorded.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a strong holiday spike (Periods 42\u201343: 315, 144) but the spike is short-lived; overall history contains multiple regime shifts. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded lead times = 0), so use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. To react to the recent elevated and volatile demand while avoiding overcommitment from a single extreme outlier, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the 5 most recent demands [54,42,31,315,144] to reflect current elevated mean and volatility). This will raise the target base-stock and the cap appropriately to improve service during the holiday surge while the recent_N sigma captures increased variability to limit excessive overstocking.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=189, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all concluded orders show lead_time=0). Recent demand shows a one-time extreme spike at Period 42 (315) followed by 144 then 29 \u2014 not a sustained 3+ period regime shift. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no sustained demand regime change, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7global sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7global std. This preserves high service level (q=0.8) while avoiding overreaction to a transient spike; current on-hand provides coverage for upcoming demand without adding extra holding cost risk.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a late-Nov/Dec spike (Periods 42-45 demands = [315,144,29,196]) suggesting elevated holiday demand and higher volatility. All concluded orders show observed lead_time=0 historically, so keep L as default (promised = 0). To capture the recent regime (holiday surge) I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to weight the most recent weeks (Periods 41-45 demands = [31,315,144,29,196]) so the base stock reflects current high mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect elevated recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine to higher target stock (improving service during the confirmed spike) while using recent volatility to temper overstock risk.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal spike confirmed in late Nov\u2013Dec: Periods 42\u201345 avg=171 units vs prior Periods 38\u201341 avg=52.5 (+225%), indicating a holiday demand surge requiring higher short-term stocking.

Promised lead time historically observed=0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep L=default. Profit/holding (4/1) implies high target service level; to capture the ongoing holiday spike use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend stocks to recent realized demand instead of long-run average.
