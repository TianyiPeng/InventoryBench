Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (weekly cadence). Recent 5 weekly demand samples: [110,107,94,107,94], mean=102.4, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence, on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time stands; no sustained changepoint detected. Profit and holding cost equal (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0) so base-stock should track demand mean. Use default lead time and default demand estimates (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) to let OR backend compute base_stock while avoiding premature adjustments for unobserved arrivals or lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent history: Period1 order of 103 arrived in Period1 (lead_time=0). On-hand=4, in-transit=0, so pipeline is empty and current cover is very low. Historical weekly demand samples (5 entries from Jan\u2013Feb) show stable demand around ~102/week. Promised lead time is 0 and recent evidence supports same-period arrivals; therefore use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full-history stable demand while the empty pipeline prompts the optimizer to replenish toward the base-stock. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given low on-hand) against holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded arrivals show orders on Periods 1\u20132 had lead_time=0 (arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period1 demand=99, Period2 demand=140. No sustained demand regime shift (only one high demand period), so use observed lead times average and population demand stats to let OR backend compute base-stock: L set by observed average lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use all available samples (default) to balance service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded demand shows a sustained uptick: Period1=99, Period2=140, Period3=137. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand plus safety. Observed lead times (from concludes) are 0 in all arrivals; use calculated lead time = 0. For demand forecast use recent_N (last 3 concluded demands) to capture the new higher regime: (1+L)*mean(last3)=~125.33. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent variability. These choices raise base-stock to cover the new higher mean and variability without assuming longer lead time or lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 2: avg demand increased from ~102 (historical Jan samples) to 125.3 based on Period1-3 concluded demands (99,140,137), +22% change; sustainment=3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $52.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands: P2=140, P3=137, P4=89. Earlier Jan baseline ~102. Lead times observed historically =0. Given recent high demand pulses but a dip in P4, I use a short recent window (last 3 periods) to capture current regime while keeping responsiveness. Promised lead time retained (default). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect current higher demand (mean of 140,137,89 = 122). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service vs holding when profit=holding (q=0.5) so base_stock centers on recent demand forecast.

Daily Reward (R_t): $62.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show a prior uptick (Periods1-3 avg ~125) but last three concluded demands (P3-5 = 137,89,92) show a different short-run pattern; no new sustained regime beyond the one already recorded. Promised lead time observed = 0 in all concluded periods. To be responsive to the most recent demand while keeping lead-time at promised value, I set L=default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=3 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the latest three concluded demands (captures current short-run average). I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock responsive to recent demand while avoiding overreaction to older samples; with profit=holding, the backend will target service level balancing profit and holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand has been variable: concluded demands P1-P6 = [99,140,137,89,92,102]. On-hand=4, in-transit=0 so coverage is low. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0. To reflect the most recent demand pattern while capturing variability, I use the last 6 concluded samples for demand mean and std (recent_N N=6). Lead time set by calculation of observed lead times (all 0). This gives the OR engine demand estimate focused on the latest regime and keeps cap/stock responsive given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 in all periods \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Demand has been variable; to react to the recent uptick (periods 5-7 demands = 92,102,173) I use a short recent window (N=3) to set forecast and volatility so orders respond quickly to the latest regime. This balances service (capture recent higher demand) against holding cost by keeping the review+lead forecast adaptive.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 2 (previously noted): demands in Periods 2-8 are elevated (140,137,89,92,102,173,195) vs earlier historical Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead demand. Observed lead times in concluded history are 0 periods consistently. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the confirmed higher regime (regime length=7 periods from Period2\u2013Period8) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current elevated mean and volatility, which raises the base-stock to improve service while the backend cap limits over-ordering given equal profit/holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $133.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has been elevated: last 3 concluded weekly demands = 173, 195, 152 (Periods 7-9) indicating a higher recent regime vs. historical Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus any lead. Observed concluded lead times = 0 periods for all past orders -> use observed lead time. I choose L by recent observed data to reflect actual 0-day arrivals. For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate (N=3) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (mean \u2248173.3 over last 3 weeks) so (1+L)\xd7mean focuses stock on current elevated demand and avoids under-ordering. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect current volatility from the same recent samples. These choices prioritize service (profit per unit = holding cost) while keeping holding exposure limited by using only the most relevant recent samples.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Use promised lead time (default L=0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Forecast demand using recent_N to capture the sustained higher regime (N=5 -> mean \u2248152.8 for review+lead period). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This raises order targets to cover the higher realized demand while the OR backend will cap orders; keeping L=default avoids assuming delayed arrivals and prevents over-ordering for presumed delays.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). Recent demand clearly higher than historical Jan samples. I'll keep L=default (promised 0, historically confirmed by concluded arrivals). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 8-12: demands 195,152,142,176,187; mean=170.4) so the OR backend sets a larger base-stock while sigma reflects recent volatility. This balances higher service needs against holding cost by anchoring forecasts to the recent sustained regime rather than old low-Jan levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 2 confirmed and intensified: avg demand increased from ~102 (historical Jan samples) to 170.4 based on Period 8-12 demands (195,152,142,176,187); sustainment=5 periods.

Recent demand has settled at a higher regime (last 5 concluded demands: 152,142,176,187,198; mean \u2248171). I use default lead time (promised=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated recent mean for the (1+L) review+lead period. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping volatility estimate aligned with recent outcomes, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 10-14) = [142,176,187,198,175], avg \u2248175.6 (+~72% vs historical Jan mean \u2248102). Lead times observed in concludes have been 0 consistently. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained elevated demand (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility around the new regime. These choices prioritize service (higher base_stock) given the clear, sustained demand increase while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with observed concludes.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders placed each period arrived same period). Recent demand has stabilized at a higher regime vs Jan samples: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 11-15) = [176,187,198,175,153], mean \u2248177.8 (+~74% vs Jan mean ~102) and sustained for 5 periods. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current elevated regime (mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5). For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect observed recent variability. These choices prioritize service at current higher demand while the OR backend will cap orders by its cap formula to limit excessive inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent concluded history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (~170 avg over recent weeks) vs. historical Jan samples (~102). On-hand=9, in-transit=0 so current coverage is low. Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded lead times are 0, so use default lead time. To capture the elevated demand regime I use recent_N (most recent 9 concluded demand samples, Periods 8\u201316) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility reflecting the current higher mean and variability. This raises the base-stock target to reduce stockouts while the capped order limit guards extreme over-ordering given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical Jan samples avg~102, but demand has shifted higher and been sustained: recent concluded demands (Periods 13-17) = [198,175,153,169,121], recent mean=163.2. No incoming shipments visible (no in-transit), so maintain promised lead time. To capture the higher sustained demand regime while limiting holding cost, set L=default (use promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 5 weeks (captures regime ~163). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma adapts service level sizing; using recent_N avoids diluting the new regime with older low-Jan data.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 8 with sustained elevated weekly sales (Periods 8-18). On-hand=58, in-transit=0; pipeline empty so we must forecast for (1+L) periods. All concluded historical lead_times = 0, so keep L = promised (default). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 8-18, 11 samples) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of those recent observations. Use sigma_hat recent_N with the same N=11 to reflect recent volatility. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change to record.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. All concluded lead-times = 0 historically; keep L=default (promised). Recent demand regime persists above historical Jan levels; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 15-19 = 153,169,121,106,108) average = 131.4. On-hand 54 vs (1+L)*forecast ~131 \u2192 inventory short, so use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts while holding cost equals profit so service/holding tradeoff is balanced by using recent data rather than long-run Jan mean. No new shipment loss signal.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 keep L=default (promised=0). Recent demand has softened vs the earlier spring peak; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 16-20: 169,121,106,108,116) average ~124. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the recent lower regime and avoid overstock. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices keep lead-time assumption (no evidence of delays) while reducing target inventory to match the new lower demand regime and limit holding cost given profit=holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17: avg decreased to ~112 based on Period 17-20 demands (121,106,108,116) vs prior avg ~170.4; sustainment=4 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover this period's demand plus lead-time. Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 0 \u2192 use default promised L=0. Demand shows a recent downward regime starting Period 17 (Period17-20 demands: 121,106,108,116; sustained 4 periods) despite an isolated larger demand in Period 21; to be conservative I use recent demand to set forecast. Therefore: set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new lower regime (reduces overstating demand from earlier high periods). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned to current lower demand while still allowing the OR engine cap to limit extreme ordering and balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand shows elevated volatility with the last 5 demands = [106,108,116,151,155]; using a short recent window captures the most recent uptick while remaining robust to prior regime shifts. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to target (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 samples and react to the recent rise. Use sigma_hat=default to let backend scale overall sample std by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (respond to recent demand increase) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 19-23: 108,116,151,155,173) shows elevated and variable demand vs historical Jan samples; use recent_N=5 to capture current regime. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so keep L=default. recent_N mu_hat and sigma_hat will make the OR backend target service for the current higher mean while reflecting recent volatility, balancing profit vs holding cost given equal profit and holding.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has shifted upward since Period 21 (demands P21-24 = 151,155,173,119; mean=149.5 over 4 periods). To capture the most recent regime and limit carryover of older higher-variance months, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (uses last 4 observed demands). This supplies the OR backend a forecast focused on the latest demand level (improves service against stockouts) while sigma from recent observations prevents excessive safety stock given holding=profit=$1.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep L=default. Recent demand (Periods 21-25: 151,155,173,119,147) averages ~149 over 5 periods, showing a sustained elevated summer regime vs earlier January baseline; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current demand level and reduce stockouts. Volatility is best estimated from the same recent window, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5. These parameters bias the OR backend toward service for the current higher-demand regime while avoiding long-tail variance from older months; with profit=holding the backend will target the mean (z=0) but using recent statistics prevents underordering amid the recent uplift.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Product is a seasonal women's knit cardigan; recent weekly demand has settled around ~150 units/week after earlier regime shifts. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in each concluded period arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. I choose L=default to reflect promised 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 22-26) are 155,173,119,147,156 \u2192 recent mean \u2248150; using recent_N keeps the forecast responsive to the most recent level while avoiding overreaction to a single week. For sigma I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters provide the OR backend a short-horizon forecast matching current observed demand and zero pipeline to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=16, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments (all historical lead_times observed =0). I set L=default to use promised lead time (historical concluded lead_time=0). I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the backend forecast to the most recent demand regime (captures current elevated mean and volatility) so the base-stock will reflect current demand while controlling holding cost given small on-hand inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weeks (P24-28 demands: 119,147,156,134,92) show elevated but variable demand; on-hand=56, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Observed lead times historically = 0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time 0), so set L by calculating observed lead times. To capture the most recent demand level and volatility I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covers P24-28). This yields (1+L)*recent mean \u2248130 demand forecast and matching recent volatility, balancing service (respond to recent higher demand) against holding cost given limited on-hand stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has been variable but no new sustained regime shift detected since prior carry-over insights; all concluded orders show actual lead time = 0 and there are no in-transit or overdue shipments (on-hand=10, in-transit=0). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand statistics, I use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (use confirmed L=0) versus holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each). No explicit increase in mu_hat or sigma_hat is applied because recent variability is not a sustained changepoint requiring adjustment.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 keep promised lead time. Recent demand shows volatility with a large one-week spike (271 in Period 30). To balance responsiveness to recent demand while limiting overreaction to a single-week outlier, I use the last 5 weeks as the forecast window so the OR backend captures the recent regime shift and variance (5 most recent demand samples include the spike but are smoothed). This increases target base-stock to better cover (1+L) periods of demand while sigma estimated from the same window reflects elevated variability, helping the capped policy avoid excessive overordering.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in history arrived same period), so keep L as default (promised=0). Recent demand has shifted upward and become more volatile; the last 8 concluded demands (Periods 24-31 = 119,147,156,134,92,120,271,240) show a higher mean (~159.9) and notable variance, so I use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime while limiting sensitivity to single-week spikes. This raises the base-stock forecast to match current demand and increases safety inventory via the recent volatility estimate, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand has jumped sharply: Period 30-32 demands = 271,240,227 (three periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must replenish for the new high regime. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use default promised lead time. For demand forecast I target the most recent regime (changepoint at Period 30) so use recent_N with N=3 (Period 30-32) to capture the elevated mean; use recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to meet the large recent demand while keeping variance estimation tied to the same short window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg increased to 246.0 based on Period 30-32 demands (271,240,227); sustainment=3 periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

All observed lead times have been 0 historically. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since concluded lead-time evidence supports it. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to anchor mu_hat to the elevated recent regime and capture current mean over the last 4 weeks. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These settings push the OR backend to raise the base-stock to serve the new higher demand while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed arrivals; this balances service level improvement vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

No overdue shipments observed (all concluded lead_times=0).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 30 (demands: P30-35 = 271,240,227,363,265,254) \u2014 sustained high demand (regime length = 6). On-hand=20, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so keep L as default (promised). To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 6 periods (regime_length=6) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand from the current high-demand samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the elevated demand while letting the capped order limit control single-period order size to limit holding cost exposure.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 \u2192 use default promised lead time. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 30 (demands P30-36 = 271,240,227,363,265,254,235); I forecast using the most recent regime to capture the elevated mean and volatility. Therefore set L=default, mu_hat=recent_N with N=7 (use last 7 periods of concluded demand to compute (1+L)\xd7mean), and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility and reduce stockouts given high demand and equal profit/holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime at Period 30 intensified: avg demand over Period 30-36 = 265.0 (samples: 271,240,227,363,265,254,235) vs prior reported avg 246.0 (+7.7%); sustainment=7 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in the high regime since Period 30 (strong Sept\u2013Oct demand). On-hand=44, in-transit=0 so available stock is low vs recent weekly demand (~258 units). Actual lead times have consistently concluded as 0; keep L = promised (default). To reflect the sustained high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures Period 31\u201337 demand mean \u2248258) and set sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to capture current volatility. These params increase the base-stock to meet the elevated demand while sigma_hat supports safety stock for variability, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time 0). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 30 (samples Period30-38: 271,240,227,363,265,254,235,221,259) \u2014 sustained high-demand regime (9 periods). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture the current high-demand regime (focus the OR base-stock on the most recent 9-week mean and volatility). This raises the backend forecast and safety stock to better meet the sustained higher demand while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand samples.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=113, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. Demand regime since Period 30 remains the dominant pattern (elevated weekly demand); recent 7-week window (Periods 34-40 equivalent recent samples) captures the current elevated but slightly variable demand while smoothing the single low week (P39). To balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding, I use a recent-window forecast to reflect the sustained higher regime and set volatility from the same window.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 so keep promised lead time. Recent demand regime (Period 30\u201336) showed sustained high demand (avg ~265) and remains the best estimator despite two weaker weeks (Periods 39\u201340). To capture the elevated recent mean/volatility I use recent_N with N=7 (regime length=7). These parameters raise the base-stock to cover the higher demand while L=default avoids assuming longer lead time without evidence.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=102, in-transit=0. Recent demand has dropped vs the late-September/October peak: Periods 39-41 demands = 147,171,120 (avg ~146 over 3 periods). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. I therefore keep L as default (promised = 0). I treat the recent drop as a new regime and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)*mean and volatility based on the most recent 3-week regime, balancing service vs holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 39: avg decreased to ~146 based on Period 39-41 demands (147,171,120); sustainment=3 periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

No overdue shipments; historical observed lead times are all 0. I therefore keep L as default (promised=0). To capture the new lower regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (use most recent 3 concluded demand samples from the confirmed regime) so the OR backend bases base_stock on the current lower mean and volatility and avoids excess holding costs given holding/profit parity (both $1).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has declined from the high-200s regime (Periods 30-37) to a lower regime starting Period 39 (samples P39-P43 = 147,171,120,120,69). On-hand=68, in-transit=0 so no confirmed upcoming arrivals. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 \u2192 use default promised L. Demand forecast should reflect the most recent regime (5-period window, regime length=5), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to make base-stock responsive to the recent drop while keeping some smoothing. This balances service level (capture recent demand) against holding cost given current on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 keep L=default (promised=0). Recent demand has fallen from earlier highs; most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 42-45 = 120,69,105,136) show a lower, sustained regime (~107.5 avg, 4-period sustain). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect the current lower-demand regime and reduce holding while maintaining service for near-term variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 42: avg decreased to ~107.5 based on Period 42-45 demands (120,69,105,136); sustainment=4 periods.

Recent demand regime (Periods 42-46 demands: 120,69,105,136,109) shows sustained lower-demand regime (avg \u2248107.8 over 5 periods). To align OR base-stock to this regime and limit holding cost, set L=default (promised 0), mu_hat using recent 5 periods to capture the current mean, and sigma_hat using recent 5 periods to capture recent volatility. This keeps target inventory aligned with observed lower demand and avoids excess holding given profit=holding.
