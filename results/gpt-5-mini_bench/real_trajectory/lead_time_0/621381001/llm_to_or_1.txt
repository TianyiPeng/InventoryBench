Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly sales show an uptick (last three: 20, 32, 48), suggesting demand has increased vs earlier weeks. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence available, so keep promised lead time. Set L to default (promised). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher mean demand (responsive to the spike). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet higher near-term demand while sigma_hat captures uncertainty to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-02-18. On-hand=9, in-transit=0, recent sale 48 matched historical high. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed on P1 arrived same period (lead_time=0). I use calculate for L to let backend confirm average observed lead time (evidence points to 0). For demand I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) which is appropriate given limited history and no sustained regime change. This keeps target base-stock aligned with long-run sample mean while avoiding overreacting to one high recent demand spike; no missing shipments to compensate for.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has risen (Period1=48, Period2=65) versus earlier historical samples (mean ~30.2). Two concluded arrivals (orders placed P1 and P2) both arrived with 0 lead time, so I trust short lead time. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. Use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to weigh recent higher demand more while retaining historical baseline, producing a (1+L)-period demand forecast responsive to the uptick. Keep sigma_hat at default to let backend compute volatility from all samples (stable estimate). This balances higher service level for recent demand increases while avoiding excessive inventory from overreacting to a short two-period spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $878.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and on-hand=34, in-transit=0. Demand samples (provided) have mean ~30.2 units/week. Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed by concluded messages, so use lead time estimate reflecting observations. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in confirmed 0. Use default demand estimate (all-sample mean \xd7 (1+L)) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base_stock consistent with historical average demand while keeping holding cost low given on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $795.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P4) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 and demand ranging ~20\u201348 with mean ~30.2. On-hand=22, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Use default lead time (promised 0) since P1\u2013P4 arrivals confirm 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects historical variability and the 0-period review so orders can replenish same-period demand while controlling holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent on-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical long-run samples show mean ~30.2/week, but the last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 1-5 conclude) are [48,65,48,43,36] with mean 48 \u2014 a sustained upward shift vs older samples. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods. To raise service level and avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost moderate, set L to promised (default=0), use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new higher demand regime, and use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. No evidence of lost shipments to address.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=24, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals and no lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time (0) consistent with confirmed evidence. Demand forecast and uncertainty will use the full-sample defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all provided samples, letting backend balance service level (via profit/(profit+holding) quantile) against holding cost. No overdue shipments to account for; keep policy standard.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical baseline samples (2019 Jan) show mean ~30.2, but recent realized weekly demand over Periods 1-7 = [48,65,48,43,36,42,62], mean=49.14, indicating a sustained upward regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I set L to default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over last 7). For volatility I use recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices align the OR backend base-stock to service the higher recent demand while keeping holding-cost tradeoffs appropriate given profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: recent avg demand (Periods 1-7) = 49.14 vs earlier sample avg = 30.20 (+62.8%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $813.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across Periods 1\u20138). Recent demand regime increased (Periods 1\u20137 avg \u224849.14 vs earlier sample avg \u224830.20); I treat that as the current regime. Use promised/default lead time (0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=7 to place (1+L)\xd7mean on the recent higher regime; use recent_N N=7 for sigma to capture recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to protect service given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P9) show all arrivals same-period \u2192 confirmed lead time = 0. Recent demand regime is higher (Periods 1\u20137 avg \u224849.1 vs earlier sample avg \u224830.2); use recent data to set demand forecast. Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (regime length=7) so (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect the new, higher-demand regime and avoid understocking while holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1). This balances service level and inventory carrying costs given fast replenishment and no in-transit units.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals matched orders P1\u2013P10). Demand has shifted higher since early periods (carry-over noted at P8) but no new sustained changepoint since Period 8. Current on-hand=20, in-transit=0; next period demand will occur after decision so order policy should cover (1+L) periods. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. To let the OR engine compute an appropriate base-stock facing the observed demand shift while respecting its statistical pooling, I select default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the engine uses all samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service level (profit>>holding cost) with holding cost given moderate on-hand inventory and no outstanding pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals matched orders each period) and a sustained demand regime increase detected earlier (Periods 1-7 avg used). No overdue shipments. I set L to calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (regime length = 7) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 7 demand samples, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 7 samples; this focuses the forecast and variability on the new higher-demand regime to balance service (reduce stockouts) while keeping holding costs moderate given low holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent history (Periods 6-12) shows elevated demand vs earlier samples (carry-over insight from P8). On-hand=17, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Confirmed lead time=0 historically, so use default lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (last 7 demand observations) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant regime; this balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost given current on-hand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use promised/default L. Recent demand regime is higher (recent 7-period avg demand = 49.14 vs earlier ~30.20); to capture the upward shift I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 samples so the OR engine sizes base-stock to the new higher demand while keeping lead time at 0. This balances service (reduce stockouts given higher demand) against holding cost by increasing target stock only to reflect the sustained recent regime.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in prior concludes). Recent demand (Periods 8\u201314) averages ~40.6/week, lower than the spike observed earlier (Periods 1\u20137). To keep the OR engine responsive to the current regime while honoring the confirmed 0 lead time, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (Periods 8\u201314) so the base-stock and cap reflect the current demand mean and variability; this balances service (avoid stockouts after the earlier high-demand regime) against holding cost by reducing reliance on older, higher-demand samples.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (P1\u2013P15 arrivals same period). Demand regime shifted upward around Period 8; recent periods (P8\u2013P15) show higher and variable demand. To capture the new regime I set L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the last 8 periods (P8\u2013P15) to reflect the post-changepoint mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise target base-stock to improve service under the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand regime (confirmed Period 8) shows elevated weekly demand vs earlier baseline. On-hand=9, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history; use default (promised) L. For demand forecast use recent regime only: average demand since the confirmed changepoint (Periods 8\u201316, 9 samples) to capture the higher mean; set mu_hat to recent_N with N=9. Use recent_N N=9 for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These settings keep the base-stock tied to the current higher-demand regime while limiting exposure to older lower-demand data.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed across many periods) and a sustained demand regime shift (recent higher mean since Period 8). To reflect the confirmed 0 lead time and to bias the forecast toward the newer, higher-demand regime, I use default lead time and recent_N for demand estimates using the recent 7-period regime (captures the sustained higher average/volatility). This balances service (avoid stockouts given current zero inventory and higher recent demand) versus holding cost by basing base-stock on the confirmed recent demand statistics.

To target service while avoiding excess holding cost, keep L as default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the post-changepoint regime (Periods 8\u201318 = 11 samples): mu_hat recent_N N=11 and sigma_hat recent_N N=11 so the OR engine sizes base stock and cap using the higher recent mean and volatility rather than older lower-demand samples.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand regime shift was previously identified at Period 8 (sustained higher demand since then). I therefore keep L as default (promised = 0). For demand forecast I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 8\u201319) using recent_N with N=12 to capture the current higher mean and variance (regime length = 12). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat directs the OR engine to size base-stock and safety stock around the confirmed higher-demand regime, balancing the $19 profit against $1 holding cost to avoid stockouts while limiting excess holding.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1-22 all arrived same period) and a sustained demand regime increase detected earlier (Period 8: avg increased ~+63%). To balance service vs holding cost with elevated recent demand, keep L as default (promised 0 which matches observed). Use recent_N demand estimate to focus the forecast on the higher recent demand regime: set mu_hat using the last 15 demand samples to capture current tempo while smoothing noise. Match sigma_hat to the same recent window (recent_N N=15) so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices increase target base-stock to avoid stockouts in the higher-demand regime while capping orders via the OR engine to limit excess holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Carry-over confirms lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 8 (higher mean). Use promised lead time (default L=0). For demand I base forecasts on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 8\u201324, 17 samples) so set mu_hat using recent_N with N=17 to capture the higher recent mean; similarly set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=17 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock aligned with the confirmed faster arrivals (L=0) and higher recent demand, balancing service level (use recent demand mean) against holding cost (no unnecessary long-horizon uplift).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P25). Recent demand has been elevated vs early samples but evidence already recorded; no new sustained changepoint. Given confirmed same-day arrivals and no missing shipments, use default lead time to let the OR engine apply its historical-demand mean and variance. This balances service level (use history-driven mu_hat) against holding cost by not inflating safety stock unnecessarily.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; last concluded period (P26) showed a large demand (83) draining inventory to 0. Historical data show a sustained higher-demand regime starting at Period 8 (carry-over insight): recent avg (P1-7)=49.14 vs earlier sample avg=30.20 (+62.8%). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (confirmed historically as 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (regime from P8\u2013P26 is 19 periods long) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 19 samples to capture the elevated demand level and reduce stockouts. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=19 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (avoid lost sales in the new higher-demand regime) while the OR backend will cap orders to limit excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 8 (higher weekly sales, several stockouts recently), and lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I set L to default (promised 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to make the forecast responsive to the higher post-Period-8 regime (uses most recent 20 samples). Volatility also uses recent_N N=20 to capture current demand variability. These choices prioritize service (capture elevated mean and variance) while the low holding cost ($1) reduces penalty for higher safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P28). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 8; use recent data to reflect elevated mean/volatility. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint demand regime (regime length \u224821 periods, capped at 20) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std; this raises the base stock to meet higher demand while accounting for holding cost via the backend service-level formula.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201329 arrivals matched same-period orders) and a sustained demand regime increase beginning around Period 8. To capture the post-changepoint regime I use recent_N on demand parameters using the most recent 20 samples (capped at 20) to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. Keeping L as default (promised=0, confirmed) minimizes pipeline uncertainty and lets the OR backend compute base-stock with demand estimates focused on the higher recent demand, balancing service (avoid stockouts) versus holding cost by using a recent-sample volatility estimate.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time=0 consistently (already recorded). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 8; to capture recent elevated demand I use recent_N on the most recent samples. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because observed lead time is confirmed 0. Use mu_hat recent_N N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the latest 20 demand samples (captures the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing noise). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet current high demand while avoiding excessive holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since around Period 8 (sustained higher weekly sales through Period 31). On-hand=35, in-transit=0 \u2014 low immediate cover vs elevated demand, so forecast should use recent demand history. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods, so keep promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use N=20 to cover the most recent stable window while capping per rules). This biases orders toward meeting elevated demand while the backend cap still limits excessive ordering; using recent statistics balances service level (profit) against holding cost given current low pipeline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 keep promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 26-32) shows a sustained high-demand regime vs earlier periods (see history: demands 83,96,103,97,94,67,63). To capture the current higher mean and variability I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covers the 7-period high-demand run). This raises target base-stock to meet service while the low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19) favor higher service. Using recent_N for both demand mean and std helps the OR backend adjust base stock and cap to the current regime while L stays default (0).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg demand (Periods 26-32)=86.7 vs prior recent avg=49.14 (+76.5%), sustained for 7 periods (2019-08-05 to 2019-09-16).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 26 (elevated weekly sales through Period 36). To capture the current elevated mean/volatility I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (Periods 26\u201336) to base the forecast on the most recent sustained regime, improving service for the higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show lead time consistently 0. Demand has a sustained higher regime beginning Period 26 (avg Periods 26-32 = 86.7) continuing through recent weeks; to capture the recent elevated demand I use a recent_N demand estimate covering the current high-demand regime. Chosen L method keeps promised lead time (0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12 (regime length from Periods 26\u201337 = 12) so the OR engine sets base stock to service the higher recent mean while controlling holding cost by using a recent-sample volatility estimate.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (Periods 1-38). Demand regime increased at Period 26 and has remained elevated through Period 38 (sustained ~13 weeks). To capture the current high-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 13 demand observations (Periods 26\u201338), aligning stocking with the confirmed higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older lower-demand data.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed many times through Period 39). Recent demand has moderated after the late-summer spike; last 6 concluded demands (P34-P39) = [103,67,55,90,46,32], recent mean ~65.5. On-hand=85, in-transit=0 so no overdue shipments. I set L=default to trust the repeatedly confirmed 0-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast/volatility to the most recent regime (last 6 weeks) so the OR backend balances service level against holding cost given current lower demand vs the earlier spike.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical lead time consistently observed = 0 (Periods 1\u201340 concluded). Demand elevated vs early samples with volatility and a recent softening after the late-summer peak; last 8 demand samples (P33\u2013P40) average ~68.5 units/week, reflecting the most relevant recent regime. I keep L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the current post-peak demand level and its volatility so the OR engine sizes base stock for (1+L) review+lead period on the most relevant recent data. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent high peaks) against holding cost given substantial on-hand stock and no in-transit units.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=0). On-hand=92, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 35-41) is lower than the peak regime around Periods 26-33; I use a recent window to capture the current lower-demand regime so the OR engine sets a lower base stock and avoids excess holding. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed=0). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 7 weeks of demand variability and mean (keeps service vs holding balanced given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 periods and there were past demand regime shifts (noted in carry-over). Recent 4-week demand has moderated (32,45,25,67) with no new sustained (>3 periods) shift. To keep policy aligned with vendor performance and long-run demand statistics I select default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all historical samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances high service level (profit/holding ratio implies q\u22480.95) with avoiding excess explicit tuning based on short noisy recent weeks.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent weeks show demand softness vs prior peak (recent demands low: P40-43 = 45,25,67,21) so I will keep parameters conservative and let the OR engine use default demand estimates and variability with promised lead time 0; this avoids overstock while preserving service given current on-hand.

To let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics and the confirmed lead time, I select default lead time and default demand statistics (mu_hat and sigma_hat). This keeps the backend's base-stock anchored to all samples while the confirmed L=0 ensures orders arrive same period, balancing service (high profit) against holding cost.

Recent weekly demand has softened in Dec vs the high Sept\u2013Oct peak; to respect current lower-demand context while keeping lead time as confirmed, I use L=default (promised 0), set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 7 samples to capture the current demand level, and keep sigma_hat=default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts if demand rebounds) and holding cost given current elevated on-hand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent weeks (post-Period 40) show a holiday dip in demand; to reflect the near-term reduced demand I base demand forecast on the most recent 7 weeks (Periods 40\u201346) where mean demand \u224831.6 units. With L=0 this gives mu_hat focused on 1-period demand; sigma_hat uses the same 7-week window to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target stock tight to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for current low-demand regime.
