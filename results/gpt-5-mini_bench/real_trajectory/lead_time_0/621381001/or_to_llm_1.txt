Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: confirmed actual lead time = 0 (carry-over insight). Inventory & demand: on-hand = 78, in-transit = 0. Recent realized weekly demand has been low in December (P43\u2013P46: 21, 28, 19, 16) \u2014 current demand regime shows no spike and is well below earlier highs. OR recommends 16 using historical averages and promised LT; OR does not account for current high on-hand. Since LT=0, any order would arrive this period and immediately increase holding cost. With 78 units on-hand, we can cover several weeks of current demand (78 / ~25 \u2248 3+ weeks) so ordering now would mostly incur unnecessary holding cost. Final strategy: place no order this period to avoid holding cost while meeting expected demand from existing stock. Monitor next periods for any sustained demand shift and resume ordering if on-hand falls below a comfortable cover (e.g., ~2\u20133 weeks of expected demand).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR's 16\u21920 units: actual lead time=0 and on-hand=78 far exceeds recent weekly demand (21,28,19,16), so avoid unnecessary holding cost.",
