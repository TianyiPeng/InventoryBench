Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 156231001 has historical weekly samples (5 weeks, mean \u2248 180.2, std \u2248 24.9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time shifts. Promised lead time used (default). Use default demand and volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service vs holding given profit=4 and holding=1 (q=0.8) and no evidence of regime change or lost shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand: Period1 sold=203; historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013Feb) average ~180. On-hand=2, in-transit=0; no overdue or lost shipments. Period1 conclude shows orders placed in Period1 arrived with lead_time=0 (one confirmed observation). No sustained changepoint (only one high week vs. historical). Therefore set lead time = calculate (use observed lead times). For demand and volatility use defaults (use all samples) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service level using historical mean while avoiding overreacting to a single recent high week.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 both arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 twice), so no evidence of lead-time elongation or lost shipments. Demand history includes Jan samples and two recent weekly demands (203, 313) \u2014 some variability but only two recent weeks, not yet a sustained regime change. To balance service level vs holding cost, use observed lead time average (calculate) and default demand estimates so the OR engine applies its pooled statistics over all samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $996.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3: 203, 313, 309) is substantially above the prior sample set (Jan samples mean=180.2). All concluded arrivals show lead time 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. I set L=default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new, higher-demand regime (Periods 1-3). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=3) so safety stock reflects the elevated variation in the recent high-demand regime. These choices raise target base-stock to meet the uplift while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean=180.2 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04) -> recent mean=275.0 (Periods 1-3: 2019-02-11..2019-02-25), +52.7%

Daily Reward (R_t): $847.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=93, in-transit=0. Historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean~180, but recent realized demand (Periods 1-3 concludes: demands 203,313,309) indicates a sustained higher regime (recent mean ~275). All observed arrivals (Periods 1-4) show lead_time=0 periods, so use observed lead time. To reflect the confirmed demand uplift while limiting exposure to holding cost, set L based on observed lead time average and use a recent_N demand estimate (N=3) to capture the new regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This biases the base-stock upward to improve service during the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased volatility from the same recent window.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has stepped up: Periods 1-3 show a higher regime (recent mean \u2248275) vs historical mean 180. On-hand=153, in-transit=0; shipments have consistently arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 for P1-P5). To protect service during the higher-demand regime, set lead time based on observed lead times and forecast demand using the most recent 3 periods (the detected new regime). Use recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the elevated demand while keeping volatility reflective of the new regime.

Daily Reward (R_t): $888.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has shown a regime shift earlier (higher mean around Periods 1-3) but the last three periods (P4-6) show demands = 235,170,237 (mean=214). On-hand=60, in-transit=0, historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. I choose L by calculating observed lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent regime (P4-6) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variance. These choices bias orders to recent realized demand, avoiding excess stock from the earlier spike while recognizing lead time is 0.

Daily Reward (R_t): $968.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent observed lead times (concluded) are 0 each period so use promised/default lead time. On-hand=4, in-transit=0 \u2014 no pipeline and risk of stockout this period. Demand history (most recent 3 demands: Periods 5-7 = 170,237,243) suggests a moderate level lower than the earlier spike; I therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast on the latest regime. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the current lower-but-variable demand while avoiding overstock given holding cost $1 vs profit $4.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has trended higher (recent 3 periods demand = 237,243,351 \u2192 elevated mean); historical concluded lead times are all 0. To capture the recent upward regime and keep orders responsive, set L by calculating observed lead times, and set demand estimate and volatility using the most recent 3 periods (captures current spike while meeting the N bounds). This balances higher service needs against holding cost by targeting the recent demand regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=45, in-transit=0; recent demand elevated vs historical. Observed concluded lead times all 0, so keep L=default. Demand in last 5 concluded periods (Periods 5-9: 170,237,243,351,286) shows a sustained higher regime; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean/volatility. This increases the base-stock to meet the higher service requirement while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean=180.2 (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) -> recent mean=275.0 (2019-02-11..2019-02-25), +52.7%

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand remains elevated vs. historical baseline; no shipments are overdue (all observed lead_times = 0). I set L by averaging observed lead times to let the backend use confirmed lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 6-10) which reflects the higher recent mean while smoothing one-off spikes; sigma_hat uses the same recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. No evidence of lost shipments, so no explicit lead-time extension.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=131, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled above historical pre-shift mean; last 5 demand samples (Periods 7-11 = 243,351,286,214,181) give a current short-window mean ~255 which better reflects recent volatility than the full-history mean. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded lead_times = 0); use default promised L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the OR backend on the recent demand regime while keeping lead time at the promised value; this balances service (avoid stockouts given recent higher demand) against holding cost given inventory on-hand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=102, in-transit=0. All concluded lead-times=0 so use promised lead time. Recent demand has trended up vs. original historical baseline; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 8-12: 351,286,214,181,209) while keeping responsiveness to current variability. This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base_stock using the recent mean/volatility over the (1+L) review horizon.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=122, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in Periods 1-13 all arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 11-13 = 181, 209, 185) remains near ~192; no new sustained regime change since earlier carry-over insight. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the most recent demand regime (captures current mean and volatility over last 3 concluded periods) so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost based on the latest observed demand.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history shows lead_time consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals list lead_time=0). Demand has varied: an earlier regime jump was recorded (Feb) but more recent 5-week average has fallen toward ~199 units/week. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1) I use promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 concluded weeks to capture current demand level while reacting to recent volatility. Recent_N N=5 chosen because the last 5 periods (P10\u2013P14) provide the most relevant short-term demand picture without overfitting a very short window. Sigma uses the same recent 5-week window to reflect current volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded lead times = 0 (no evidence of delays), so keep L=default (promised=0). Recent demand (Periods 11-15 = 181,209,185,205,227) indicates current regime ~201 units/week; use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the most recent behavior rather than older higher-demand samples. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings balance service (capture current demand level) against holding cost given zero inventory and no in-transit units.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1\u201316) show repeated arrivals with lead_time=0 \u2014 no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Recent demand has fluctuated but no new sustained regime shift (requires 3+ consistent periods). I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time from concluded history (will be 0). I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all samples for (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level vs holding cost given stable lead time and mixed demand signals.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=90, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has softened versus the earlier high-volatility jump; last 5 demand observations (Periods 14-18) show a lower recent mean, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt the forecast to the most recent regime and reduce excess holding given holding cost >0. This keeps base-stock responsive while backend will cap orders.

Recent demand (Periods 17-19 = 99,127,83) is materially lower than the earlier high-volatility regime; to reflect the current lower regime I set demand forecast using the last 3 periods. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=3) keeps the base-stock responsive to the current lower demand and limits holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has fallen sharply versus the Feb\u2013May regime: last 4 concluded demands = [99,127,83,41], average = 87.5. On-hand = 84, in-transit = 0; inventory already covers roughly one recent-week demand. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded lead_times = 0), so use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. To avoid overstocking given the clear recent drop, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (capture the new low-demand regime). This reduces target base-stock and caps order size appropriately, balancing service level and holding cost given high holding cost relative to profit.

No evidence of lost shipments; historical concluded lead times are 0. To avoid overstock while matching current lower demand, keep L at promised (default) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 17-24) show much lower demand than early-period spike; no outstanding arrivals or missing shipment evidence\u2014all concluded arrivals have lead_time=0 historically. I retain promised lead time (default) because concluded history consistently shows 0 and there is no sustained delayed-arrival signal. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7historical std from all samples; this avoids overfitting to short recent dips while the backend's capped policy will limit orders. This balances service (using long-run demand) against holding cost given current positive on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=232, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen (Periods 20-25 demands = [41,53,53,30,9,19], recent mean \u224834.2) versus earlier higher regime; there are 6 recent samples available. I use promised lead time (default=0) since all concluded lead times =0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the new low-demand summer regime and avoid overstock; this keeps orders small given large on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=148, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has fallen substantially since late May\u2013June (Periods 17\u201326: demands 99,127,83,41,53,53,30,9,19,84 \u2192 avg \u2248 61). Historical early-2019 regime was much higher, but that spike was transient. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history (all observed lead_time=0), so use default L to keep backend assumption. To avoid overstocking given current low demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the low recent mean and volatility; detect recent regime from Periods 17\u201326 (length 10) and use N=10. These parameters steer the OR engine to a lower base-stock reflecting current demand while retaining service-level math.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

All concluded lead-time observations remain 0. I therefore keep L at default (promised lead time=0) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7historical std; this balances service vs holding cost given no confirmed sustained demand shift and no in-transit coverage.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent on-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded orders: lead_time=0). Recent demand has trended lower through summer with some volatility, but no new sustained regime shift (no 3+ periods of elevated demand versus prior insight). To avoid overstocking given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4, use default lead time and population-wide demand statistics so the OR engine balances service level and holding cost using its calibrated z. Default L uses promised lead time (0) which matches observed concluded lead times; default mu_hat/sigma_hat let the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, leveraging the full historical sample set rather than risking overreaction to short recent swings.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand 129, in-transit 0 \u2014 no overdue arrivals (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). Recent weekly demand has been lower than the early-year spike; last 5 observed demands (Periods 25-29) = [19,84,197,149,114], so I base the forecast on the most recent regime. I set L=default to trust the promised lead time (historical observed lead times = 0). I choose mu_hat recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the latest 5 samples \u2014 this reduces excessive stock buildup from earlier high-demand periods while preserving service level for current demand volatility.

Recent demand is variable but no new sustained regime change since prior insights. Use default (promised) lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing profit vs. holding cost under observed stable lead time.

Recent demand (Periods 27-31 = 197,149,114,243,274) shows elevated and volatile demand vs. long-run historical mean. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to make mu_hat responsive to the latest regime while avoiding overreaction to a single week. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level for elevated recent demand against holding cost given zero pipeline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent weeks show elevated demand (Periods 30-32 demand = 243, 274, 255) vs earlier historical baseline; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet this higher recent run-rate. No concluded lead-time shifts (all observed lead_time = 0), so use promised lead time. Set mu_hat using a recent_N window to capture the current high-demand regime (N=3), and sigma_hat also recent_N (N=3) to reflect short-term volatility. These params raise the backend base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean=180.2 but recent demand has jumped: Periods 31-33 demands = {274,255,496}, recent 3-period mean = 341.67 (+89.7% vs historical). All concluded lead times are 0 (orders in history arrived same period). To respond to the sustained high demand over the last 3 periods I set L=default (promised lead time=0, historical evidence consistent). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to force the OR engine to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and capture the current elevated demand regime. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility (so safety stock scales to observed short-term variation). This configuration prioritizes service (reduce imminent stockouts) while the OR backend cap will limit extreme orders and control holding costs.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime (carry-over: recent mean ~275 units/week). On-hand=97, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so I use L=default to keep model aligned with promised lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and recent volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the most recent 5 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This focuses the OR engine on the current elevated demand pattern while limiting exposure to older low-demand data, balancing service level (reduce stockouts) against holding cost given current on-hand stock.

Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so keep L as default. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat biases the base-stock to meet the higher short-term demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts during current spike) against holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=90, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (orders in history arrived same period), so set L via calculate (average observed = 0). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 31 (sustained high demands in Periods 31-36), so forecast using the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 31-36) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current higher mean and volatility. This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts while the OR cap limits extreme orders; using recent_N balances service level against $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time historically observed as 0 in all concluded periods; no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. Recent demand since Sept shows elevated/volatile weekly demand (several weeks with 250-500 units sold). To capture the recent higher mean and volatility I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 12 samples to reflect the current regime (captures Sept\u2013Oct spike while remaining robust). L uses default (promised lead time = 0). This biases the OR base-stock upward to preserve service during the high-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock for volatility, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. Demand has shown an elevated recent regime vs the small 2019-Jan sample set; to capture the current high-demand regime I use recent data for forecast and volatility. L set to promised (default). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the most recent demand regime while respecting the N selection rules and balancing service level (higher mu_hat) against holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been elevated (Periods 35-39 demands: 351, 337, 447, 309, 322) indicating a higher recent regime than historical early-2019 samples. No evidence of lead-time changes or lost shipments (all concluded lead_time=0 historically). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (uses last 5 periods to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability, which helps the OR backend set a larger base stock while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. On-hand=129, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times have been consistently 0, so use default promised lead time. Recent demand since early Sep shows a sustained higher regime vs. the long-run historical mean (several weeks of elevated weekly sales in Sep\u2013Nov), so I bias the demand forecast to recent data. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the elevated recent mean/volatility (recent regime length ~12 weeks). This increases target base stock to reduce stockouts during the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability to keep safety stock adequate given holding cost vs. profit tradeoff.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (period 42). Recent weeks (Periods 34-41) show sustained higher demand (week demands: 358,351,337,447,309,322,271,285) versus long-run historical mean; on-hand=113, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. I keep L=default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 demand samples (Periods 35-41) to reflect the elevated mean and volatility and to tighten the base-stock to meet service while balancing holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 in all observed periods, so use default promised lead time. Recent demand has risen materially vs early-sample mean; last 8 periods (P35-P42) show a sustained higher regime (mean \u2248 348 units) including a large spike in P42, so I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the current elevated demand (1+L times recent mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect the increased recent volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to meet higher service needs while sigma recent_N controls the variability term to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost.

No evidence of lead-time shifts (all concluded lead_times=0). Choose L=default to trust promised lead time=0. Set mu_hat using recent_N N=4 to capture current elevated demand over the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility (includes the 461 spike). These parameters raise the base-stock to meet holiday demand while sigma captures uncertainty to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Recent demand has been elevated through Sep\u2013Dec vs earlier historical average; on-hand=31, in-transit=0. Promised lead time has historically been 0 with all concluded arrivals at lead_time=0, so use default L to keep backend lead-time assumption. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 samples, biasing orders toward current elevated demand while limiting sensitivity to single-week spikes. This balances service (avoid stockouts given low on-hand and no pipeline) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so keep default lead time. Recent demand (last several weeks) is elevated and volatile around the holiday window (Periods 42-45: demands 461,200,367,468) compared with earlier baseline; to capture this short-term spike I use recent demand estimates. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast and uncertainty on the most recent regime so the OR backend raises the base-stock and cap appropriately to avoid stockouts while limiting extra holding. This balances higher profit per unit vs holding cost during a known seasonal peak.
