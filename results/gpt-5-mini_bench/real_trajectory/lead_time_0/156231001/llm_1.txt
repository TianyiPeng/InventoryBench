Lead time: historical conclude messages show all past orders arrived same period => actual lead_time = 0. Demand regime: recent weeks (Periods 43\u201346) show elevated demand (true demand = 200,367,468,450) with large spikes in last three weeks (367,468,450); overall recent average skewed upward. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so any order placed will arrive this period and be available to meet Period 47 demand. Decision logic: profit per sold unit = $4, holding cost = $1/unit/period. Given high recent holiday demand and 0 lead time, prioritize service (capture sales) even at modest holding risk. Order covers expected demand for this week using recent peak-week observations \u2014 chosen to meet likely demand while avoiding excessive ending inventory.",
