Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand series: 2019-01-07:54, 01-14:53, 01-21:67, 01-28:78, 02-04:154. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, profit= $1, holding=$1. Evidence of a sustained upward shift in demand beginning three weeks ago (67,78,154). No concluded arrivals to infer lead time, so keep promised lead time. To react to the detected demand regime change while limiting noise, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent N=3 samples (regime length=3) so the OR engine sizes base stock for the higher recent mean and volatility. L left as default to avoid overestimating lead time given no arrival evidence. This balances service level for the observed demand spike against holding cost by focusing forecasts on the confirmed recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent 3-week avg = 99.7 vs prior avg = 54.7 (+82%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent 3-week avg higher). Last concluded period (P1) confirms lead time = 0 (ordered P1 arrived P1). On-hand and in-transit = 0, so must replenish for higher recent demand. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (3-period regime length). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent data show a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (recent high-demand weeks including 2019-01-21..2019-02-18). Observed conclude messages: Period1 and Period2 orders both arrived same-period (lead_time=0), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; given profit=holding ($1/$1) the critical fractile=0.5 (z\u22480) so base-stock \u2248 demand forecast. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (samples from 2019-01-21 onward: 67,78,154,177,162). I set L to calculate (backend will compute average observed lead times=0). This balances service (use recent regime mean) against holding cost by reflecting the confirmed higher demand while keeping safety stock moderate via sigma_hat from the same recent window.

Daily Reward (R_t): $54.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 in Periods 1-3 (orders arrived same period). Demand has experienced a sustained upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (noted in carry-over). Current on-hand=37, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L to default (use promised 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (last 3 demands: 177,162,91 \u2192 recent mean ~143.3; mu_hat=(1+L)*mean). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the higher recent demand while avoiding excess inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=28, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals observed; all concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0. Historical recent demands (Periods 2-4 = 162, 91, 116) reflect the higher regime identified earlier. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because concluded messages consistently show 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (keeps (1+L)\xd7mean focused on latest weeks). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep the base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while avoiding overcommitment given current low pipeline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently \u2192 keep default promised L. Demand regime increased starting 2019-01-21 and has been sustained for 3+ periods (recent demands: 91,116,85). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the higher short-term mean and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while limiting excess inventory given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 each period (orders placed arrived same period). Demand has been elevated vs earlier historical baseline; recent 6 concluded demands (P1\u2013P6) provide the best estimate of current regime. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend sets base-stock to meet service while avoiding excess holding (profit and holding cost equal, implying q\u22480.5). No missing shipments to account for.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has moderated after the Jan spike; to reflect the most current demand profile use recent_N over the last 7 weeks to set mu_hat so the base-stock reflects recent demand levels. Keep sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (using recent demand for mean) vs holding cost (avoids overreacting to older high outliers).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period so promised lead time remains valid. Demand has been higher since the Jan 21 changepoint; using a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the new regime. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time, mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent weekly demand (Periods 4\u20138 average \u2248102.8), and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These settings raise target base-stock to improve service given low on-hand inventory while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=18, in-transit=0; recent concludes (P1\u2013P9) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (higher mean); to reflect the new regime I use recent data rather than full-sample averages. Set L=default to trust promised 0 (confirmed by concluded arrivals). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (regime length from P3\u2013P9 = 7 weeks) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent higher-demand regime, increasing service while limiting excess holding given current low on-hand and zero in-transit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Recent demand has trended down from March peaks; last 5 demands (Periods 7-11) = [97,114,85,60,44], suggesting a lower short-term mean and lower variability than the earlier spike. No overdue arrivals or lost shipments observed (all past orders concluded with lead_time=0). To keep pipeline aligned with current demand while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecasts using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the recent downshift in demand: mu_hat recent_N N=5 and sigma_hat recent_N N=5. These parameters bias replenishment toward the recent lower-demand regime, reducing holding cost while preserving service for near-term demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history shows the previously recorded regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (already captured); no additional sustained changepoint since. Given stable lead time and sufficient sample history, use default (all-sample) estimates for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service-level vs holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=26, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (all conclude messages show lead_time=0). Recent demand shows a lower, variable regime vs the early Jan spike. I set L=default to use promised 0. For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to target the most recent 5 weeks' mean demand (captures current demand level ~72 units/week) so base_stock aligns with present demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility and ensure the backend's safety stock responds to recent variability. These choices balance service (respond to current demand) against holding cost given low on-hand and no in-transit inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Historical demand (Periods 1-14) shows an elevated recent mean (~97 units/week) with prior spike in late Jan recorded in carry-over. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Current on-hand=18, in-transit=0, so we need replenishment to cover expected weekly demand. Use default lead time (observed=0) and default demand estimates based on full-sample mean to let the OR backend compute base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost given symmetric profit=holding. This keeps policy stable and leverages the full history since no new sustained regime change after the previously recorded shift.

Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 in all past periods and no missed shipments; prior carry-over noted a demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (already recorded). To be conservative and consistent with observed history, use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set.

Demand history through Period 16 shows no new sustained changepoint since the prior noted regime shift; therefore use promised lead time and population-wide demand stats so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/std.

Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0. I therefore keep L=default (promised=0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the latest regime and reduce risk of overstock given equal profit/holding costs.

Use promised lead time (default=0) so OR backend assumes same-period arrivals. For demand forecast and uncertainty use defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to incorporate full history\u2014this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1) and avoids overfitting to short recent fluctuations. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift in concluded history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has been modest and stable (~40\u201362 units over the last 8 periods: P12\u2013P19 demand samples include 100,71,54,91,62,43,47,46 but more recent 8-week center is ~58 with downward drift). Promised lead time historically confirmed at 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I use recent demand to adapt the review+lead forecast: set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime and reduce sensitivity to older high outliers in Feb. This balances service level vs holding cost given no in-transit stock and moderate recent demand.

All concluded orders show actual lead_time=0 historically. No overdue or missing shipments. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised operations and long-run demand stats, use default lead time and default demand/volatility (no strong new sustained regime since the previously recorded early-Jan shift). This balances service (use long-run sample mean) vs holding cost given profit=holding (neutral service-level z*).

Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand (last ~8 weeks) is noticeably lower than the early 2019 spike; to keep orders aligned with the recent lower regime and avoid excess holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data. I choose recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime while smoothing short noise. This keeps base_stock close to recent demand \xd7 (1+L), reducing overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=64, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments; historical concluded lead times=0. Recent demand has fallen since June \u2014 last 8 weeks (Periods 17-24) average ~33.8 units/wk with lower variance versus the earlier elevated regime. Use promised lead time (default=0) since concluded history shows L=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the new lower-demand regime and reduce overstock while maintaining service.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has fallen vs earlier months (Periods 23-25 demand = 34,14,17), indicating a new low-demand regime starting ~Period 23. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 in concluded history (many arrivals with lead_time=0), so keep default lead time. To avoid excess holding cost given low recent demand, set mu_hat using a recent_N estimate (captures the recent low regime). Use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect recent lower variability. Chosen methods (L=default; mu_hat recent_N N=3; sigma_hat recent_N N=3) bias the OR engine toward lower base stock and lower order caps, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the recent demand level.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent conclude shows stockouts (Periods 22,25,26) but historical concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time has been 0 consistently. Prior carry-over noted demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (sustained). I keep L at promised (default) because concluded history shows lead_time=0 repeatedly. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to weight the more recent elevated demand while smoothing older noise; this biases base-stock upward to avoid further stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility for safety stock.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 after two recent large demand episodes (Period 26 demand=100, Period 27 demand=166) causing stockouts. Historical lead times observed have been 0 periods consistently. I treat lead time as promised (default). Demand appears to have shifted upward recently; I use recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the newest regime (last three observed demands 17,100,166 -> recent mean ~94.3) so the OR engine targets inventory to cover the elevated short-run demand while sigma from the same window captures increased volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost by focusing on the most recent regime rather than diluting with older low-demand periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 14, 17, 100, 166, 133) so use a short recent window to capture current regime and volatility. All concluded arrivals show lead time 0 historically, so keep promised lead time. Set L=default to use promised 0. Set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect latest (higher) mean across the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility; this increases safety stock while avoiding overstating long-run variance. This configuration helps the OR backend target higher service for the recent high-demand regime while controlling excess holding by not using full-history averages.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained uplift since Period 26 (four periods of high demand), so use recent-demand estimates to capture the new regime. Observed lead times have consistently concluded as 0, so keep L as default (promised). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to weight the most recent demand regime and increase both forecast mean and volatility for the OR backend to raise target base stock while controlling cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg increased from 72.0 (Periods 1\u201325) to 126.0 (Periods 26\u201329) (+75%), sustained 4 periods

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded overdue shipments. Historical concludes consistently show lead_time=0. Demand has shifted to a higher regime starting Period 26 (sustained through Period 30). To capture the recent elevated demand I use a recent_N forecast over the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201330, length=5). L kept at default (promised=0) since concludes confirm 0. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) biases the base-stock toward the current higher mean and observed volatility, improving service while avoiding excessive inventory from older low-demand weeks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time=0 (orders placed previously all arrived same period). Demand has a sustained higher regime starting Period 26 (Periods 26\u201331 demand: 100,166,133,105,167,178; mean\u2248141.5). To capture the recent elevated demand I set L to default (promised=0) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (regime length = 6 weeks since Period 26). This focuses the forecast/uncertainty on the confirmed higher-demand regime and helps the OR backend raise base-stock to avoid stockouts while keeping holding exposure tied to observed volatility.

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=7) for demand mean and volatility to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201332) so the OR backend will size base stock to current elevated demand while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 26 (2019-08-05) with 8 weeks of elevated demand vs prior periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the higher regime. Use L default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand forecast, use recent_N=8 (regime length=8) so mu_hat reflects the current higher mean over the review+lead period. Use sigma_hat recent_N=8 to capture the elevated variability in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping variability estimate aligned for OR's safety stock calculation.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 (all arrived same period). Demand regime: sustained higher-demand regime since Period 26 (Periods 26\u201334) \u2014 I treat this as the active regime. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded data confirm 0 actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (regime length = 9 weeks, N = min(9,20) = 9) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 9 samples (Periods 27\u201335 demand samples available to backend) capturing the elevated demand; sigma_hat recent_N N=9 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping holding pressure aligned with profit=holding (q=0.5).

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Historical conclude messages show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so keep L as promised (default=0). Demand jumped at Period 26 and has stayed elevated through Period 35 (sustained ~10 periods). Use recent_N for demand to capture the new higher regime: set mu_hat using the last 10 samples (N=10) to reflect (1+L)-period demand under the new mean; set sigma_hat using the same recent 10 samples to capture current volatility. This raises the base-stock to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding risk tied to recent variance.

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 historically, so use default promised L=0. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 26\u201336, regime length 11) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the recent elevated samples. This balances service (higher mean) while keeping volatility anchored to recent observations given holding cost = profit (1:1).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=62, in-transit=0; recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 in concluded periods) and a sustained higher demand regime already recorded. No overdue or lost shipments visible. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility (use all historical samples) so the OR engine computes base_stock from the full-sample mean and std, preserving the previously confirmed regime shift while avoiding overfitting to short fluctuations.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrive same period), so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand has settled into a higher regime; last 8 concluded demands (Periods 31\u201338) avg \u2248120 units/week, so I use recent_N N=8 for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the current regime. Use recent_N N=8 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This increases target base_stock to meet current weekly demand while avoiding excess holding given unit profit=holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 26 (carry-over note). Recent weeks (Periods 26\u201339) are the best evidence for current demand. I keep lead time as promised (default=0) because all concluded arrivals show 0 periods; no late/lost shipments observed. To capture the elevated regime I use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 26\u201339 length) for both demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher mean and recent variability. This balances service (protects against stockouts in the high regime) versus holding cost by limiting the window to recent data rather than all historical low-demand periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently; no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Demand recently (Periods 31\u201340) shows elevated but variable weekly sales; to focus the forecast on the most relevant recent regime I use a 10-week recent window. Set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat = recent_N (N=10) to capture current demand level over the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat = recent_N (N=10) to capture recent demand volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the most recent demand regime while limiting excess inventory given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5 implies moderate service target).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand has softened vs the late-summer peak: last 5 realized demands (Periods 37\u201341) = 73,74,67,66,44 (recent mean ~64.8). On-hand=66, in-transit=0; no shipments outstanding. Historical data shows prior regime shifts (recorded earlier) but the most recent 5 weeks indicate a lower-demand regime. I therefore keep L at default (promised 0) because all concluded lead-time observations remain 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and variability on the latest lower-demand regime; this reduces over-ordering versus using the long-run mean while still covering near-term demand. This balances service (maintain ~1 week cover given on-hand ~66) against holding cost by lowering target stock to recent demand levels.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 38\u201342) has moderated vs the high spike observed around Periods 26\u201334. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent lower-demand regime (Periods 38\u201342) so the OR engine targets a smaller base-stock appropriate to current demand and avoids excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a downshift in the last 3 weeks (demands 44,48,17) after earlier high-season spikes; no evidence of delayed/lost shipments (concluded arrivals match orders, lead_time observed=0 historically). I set L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (historical confirms). I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to react quickly to the recent lower demand regime and avoid excess holding cost over the holiday week; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect short-term volatility in these last 3 observations. These parameters reduce target base-stock and cap order size to prioritize profit vs holding cost given current low on-hand and subdued recent demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Maintain promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for demand estimates to focus the forecast on the latest low-demand regime (last 5 concluded demands ~66,44,48,17,27) and capture recent volatility for sigma. This keeps the backend's base-stock aligned to current demand and avoids overstocking ahead of uncertain seasonality given profit=holding (q\u22480.5).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=26, in-transit=0 \u2014 on-hand roughly covers ~1.3 weeks at recent demand. Use promised lead time (default) since all concluded arrivals show L=0. To avoid excess holding during a low-demand holiday window, set demand forecast to recent_N (N=3) to capture the current lower regime; use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (covers ~current demand) vs holding cost by tailoring base_stock to the latest observed low demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

No evidence of new sustained lead-time change (historical observed LT=0). Choose L=default to trust promised lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (keeps base stock responsive to current demand drop). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect recent demand volatility rather than long-run variability. This reduces overstock risk while keeping service for current demand levels.
