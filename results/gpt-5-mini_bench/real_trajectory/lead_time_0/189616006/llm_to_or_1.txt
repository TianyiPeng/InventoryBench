Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows an upward shift (last 3 weeks: 121, 153, 145) versus earlier weeks (37, 95). Promised lead time is 0 and on-hand/in-transit = 0, so we must cover current period demand. I set L=default (use promised 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the higher recent mean (responsive to the upward regime). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward to avoid stockouts given rising demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand history (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) average \u2248110 units/week; Period 1 demand=135. On-hand=33, in-transit=0 so available stock covers ~0.3 periods of typical demand. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=168, lead_time=0). Promised lead time is 0 and the single observed arrival confirms same-period delivery. No evidence of lost shipments. I choose default lead time (use promised L=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run sample stats while reflecting confirmed same-period lead time; it balances service level vs holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Two concluded arrivals (Period1 and Period2) both show lead_time=0; recent demand (Period1=135, Period2=191) is above older historical weekly mean but only two periods\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained regime change. I choose to let the backend infer L from observed lead times (calculate) and use default demand/volatility (mu_hat default, sigma_hat default) so base-stock = (1+L)*mean_all + z*\xb7std_all, letting the OR engine balance profit vs holding cost while avoiding overreaction to a short two-period uptick.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2434.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Recent observed weekly demand (Periods 1-3) = [135,191,132], vs historical sample mean=110.2 (2019-01 samples). On-hand=74, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Evidence of sustained higher demand over 3 periods (mean ~152.7, +38.6% vs historical). Set lead time to promised (default, observed arrives with 0 in all concluded periods). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime and increased volatility so OR backend raises base-stock while limiting excess holding cost given on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: recent avg (P1-P3)=152.7 vs prior historical avg=110.2 (+38.6%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $2592.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demand has shifted up vs historical Jan samples: concluded demands P1-P4 = 135,191,132,140 with a recent regime (P1-P3) average \u2248152.7 vs long-run mean 110.2 (+~39%). On-hand=68, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 consistently. To protect service given the sustained higher-demand regime (3 periods) I set L to default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher mean and short-term volatility (N chosen = 3 because the changepoint is recent and sustained for 3 periods). This raises the base-stock to meet higher expected demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock reflecting observed variability, trading slightly higher holding cost for improved fill rates given high profit/holding ratio.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Observed lead times in concluded history (P1\u2013P5) are consistently 0 \u2192 actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand (Periods 3\u20135 = 132, 140, 125) reflects the post-change regime noted earlier; I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the current lower/stable three-period mean (reduces influence of older pre-shift samples). L set by calculate to reflect observed lead times. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=3) so backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 3 demands, matching the recent regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to capture volatility in the same window. No evidence of missing shipments or delayed arrivals to adjust lead time upward.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has risen since Period 4 (three-period higher regime P4\u2013P6). On-hand=34, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. To react to the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0) but base demand forecast on the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 4\u20136) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, improving service during the confirmed higher-demand period while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend's safety-stock formula.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 4 (higher mean since P4). On-hand=40, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To capture the new regime, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 (use Periods 4-7 demand to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean over the new regime). I set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This keeps the base-stock keyed to the confirmed higher-demand regime while limiting inventory buildup given low holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has stabilized below earlier spike; last 5 demands (P4-P8)=140,125,111,110,116, mean\u2248120.4. On-hand=29, in-transit=0 \u2014 low cover vs expected demand. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time 0), so use default L. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the post-shift regime average over the most recent 5 periods. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent variability. These choices keep the base-stock aligned to current lower-but-stable demand while reacting to low on-hand inventory to avoid stockouts given same-period arrivals.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand since Period 4 has been lower than the early spike but remains elevated vs very old historical samples; recent demands (P4-P9) = [140,125,111,110,116,91], so I use a recent-window forecast. On-hand=50, in-transit=0 so we need orders to cover (1+L) periods of demand. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so keep default L. Use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime (Periods 4\u20139) and limit influence of older samples; this balances service level (capture recent higher mean) against holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P10) shows consistent same-period arrivals with observed lead_time=0; earlier carry-over noted demand regime shift at Period 4 (sustained). Current inventory: on-hand=46, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. I select default lead time to trust promised 0 (supported by 10 concluded observations). I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all historical samples (1+L periods) to compute base_stock and variability; this balances higher recent demand levels (captured in history and the prior carry-over insight) against holding cost, letting the engine compute the appropriate service quantile and capped order. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments or lead-time drift are warranted given consistent arrivals.

To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set mu_hat using a recent-window average (N=5) and set sigma_hat from the same recent window (N=5) to capture current volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period so promised lead time is consistent. Demand regime shift detected at Period 4 (user carry-over): sustained higher demand from P4 onward. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=9 (regime from P4..P12 = 9 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 9 demands) to capture the new higher-demand regime. For volatility I use recent_N N=9 to compute sigma_hat from the same regime. These choices prioritize service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by sizing base-stock to the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping lead time at the observed/promised value.

A demand regime shift was previously recorded at Period 4 and remains the most recent sustained change; no additional changepoint detected in recent periods. Given stable concluded demand history since that shift and modest holding cost ( $1 ) vs profit ( $19 ), use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR engine applies its calibrated base-stock and safety-stock formulas.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=121, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 periods (every concluded order arrived same period). Recent demand has softened relative to the early-Jan samples but the previously recorded demand regime shift (Period 4) is already noted. To keep decisions simple and robust given stable lead-time evidence and ample on-hand inventory, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This prevents overreacting to recent low demand while the on-hand stock is healthy and holding cost is low relative to profit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent demand has fallen from spring peaks to a lower regime: last 5 demands = [73,54,72,50,48], mean=59.4. On-hand=122, in-transit=0, so inventory currently covers ~2 periods at this demand. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically. I therefore keep L at promised/default (0) and set demand forecast using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower-demand regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to capture current variability. This reduces excess holding (holding cost $1) while keeping service by targeting ~1+L periods of expected demand based on the recent mean.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concluded orders show actual lead time = 0 consistently (all concluded arrivals list lead_time 0). Recent demand (Periods 13-17 = 54,72,50,48,53) is lower and represents the most relevant regime for forecasting. Use L=default to keep promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent lower mean and volatility, reducing excess holding while maintaining service.

Historical demand samples (seed) mean=110.2 used as baseline; recent periods show lower demand but not a sustained regime change beyond the previously recorded shift at Period 4. Therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the OR engine anchored to confirmed lead time=0 while letting it set base-stock balancing the high profit (q\u22480.95) against holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=132, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand (last 5 periods: P15-P19 = 50,48,53,36,35) averages ~44.4, substantially below earlier peak; no evidence of lead-time deviations (all concluded lead_times=0). Given high profit vs holding (profit=19, hold=1 \u2192 target service level ~95%), but current on-hand already covers several weeks of demand, I choose promised lead time (default) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stocking to recent lower demand regime while preserving high service level. This avoids over-ordering from older higher-demand samples and accounts for reduced volatility in the most recent 5 weeks.

Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly) and no sustained new lead-time delays or lost shipments. Demand history shows variability but no new sustained regime change since the last recorded insight. Given promised lead time 0 matches historical observations, use default lead time and default demand estimates (use full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend can apply its base-stock calculation. This keeps orders conservative given high profit-to-holding ratio (q\u22480.95) and current healthy on-hand position, avoiding unnecessary extra inventory while preserving service level.

Recent concluded history shows mostly low mid-week demand (last 3 periods: 35,20,21) after earlier sustained higher regime noted at Period 4; no new sustained changepoint detected. Promised lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded messages, so keep L=default. To avoid unnecessary replenishment given high on-hand and modest recent demand, use default demand forecasts (backend will scale by (1+L) and historical sample stats). This balances service (protects against occasional demand) while minimizing holding cost exposure.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Recent demand has fallen into a lower summer regime (last 5 demands: P20-P24 = 20,21,40,47,28; recent mean ~31.2) versus earlier higher-season values. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically (orders consistently arrived same period). On-hand=134, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock but demand now lower. Because demand regime shifted and is sustained, use a recent_N forecast to capture the lower current demand for the review+lead period; keep L at default (promised=0) given consistent observed 0 lead time. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce ordering toward the lower summer demand while the OR backend (high service level due to profit/holding) will still maintain safety stock via z*.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5. On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has moderated (Periods 21-25 demands = [21,40,47,28,63], recent mean \u224839.8) after the earlier sustained regime shift noted at Period 4. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To keep inventory responsive to the near-term observed demand while avoiding unnecessary holding, I set L=default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 weeks, which captures current lower-volatility behavior and will reduce excess ordering compared with using the entire historical series.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent stockout in Period 26 (demand 89, sold 71) so we must replenish to cover upcoming demand. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised lead time. Demand has remained in the higher regime identified at Period 4 and sustained since, so use recent_N over that regime to capture current mean/volatility. Set L to default (promised). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=20 (cap regime length to 20) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std \u2014 this balances higher service level after the sustained demand increase while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=3, in-transit=0 -> urgent replenish to avoid stockouts. Observed lead times in concludes are consistently 0, so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand has been higher and more variable in the last weeks (Periods 23-27 demands = 47, 28, 63, 89, 105); I use a recent_N forecast to focus the base-stock on the last 5 weeks (mean \u224866.4) and match recent volatility for safety. These parameters raise target stock to cover current short-term demand while limiting holding cost exposure by using a short recent window.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Recent demand has shown a sustained higher regime noted earlier (recorded as carry-over), but no new changepoint in the last periods: supply arrivals returned to promised timing and demand recently (P27-P28) were 105 and 101. Use promised lead time and backend's default demand statistics so OR engine applies full historical sample mean/variance across (1+L) periods. This balances service (maintain coverage given elevated recent weekly demand) while avoiding excess holding cost since on-hand is low and arrivals have been reliable.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=85, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals visible in concludes and historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. Recent weeks show elevated demand versus long-run average (recent 5 period demands: 63,89,105,101,72 -> mean ~86) so I bias forecast to recent behavior to avoid stockouts. Choose L=default to reflect observed 0 lead time; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher mean and volatility and reduce stockout risk while limiting extra holding cost.

Promised lead time historically observed = 0. To keep the backend policy aligned with observed fast replenishment and avoid excess holding (holding cost $1 vs profit $19), use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service level (quick replenishment) while limiting carry inventory given low holding cost relative to profit.

Recent demand has been above earlier history (carry-over insight exists from Period 4), so I bias the demand forecast to the most recent regime: use a recent_N mean over the last 5 demand observations to capture the current level while keeping variance estimation from full history. sigma left as default to let backend scale variability across (1+L). These parameters aim to replenish to cover the next (1+L) period(s) of demand while limiting excess holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep L as default (promised lead time=0). Demand has recently been higher and variable; I use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 demand samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime (last demands: P29-P33 = 72,83,99,85,126). This raises the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast and short-term volatility estimate, prompting the OR engine to build safety stock while respecting the backend cap.

Recent demand (Periods 30-34 = 83,99,85,126,100) shows a current mean ~98.6 which is slightly below earlier historical peaks; use recent_N to capture the current regime. Volatility has also moderated recently, so use recent_N for sigma to reflect current std. These settings keep base-stock tuned to current demand while avoiding excess holding given low holding cost ($1) and $19 profit.

Demand showed a sustained upward regime starting at Period 4 (previously recorded); to keep the base-stock responsive to the higher, persistent demand and recent variability, I use recent_N=20 (captures ~5 months of recent weekly demand including the confirmed higher-regime data). This balances service (avoid stockouts with current on-hand low) against holding cost by using a recent-window forecast rather than the full-history mean which dilutes the higher recent demand. sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods and recent demands show no new sustained regime change beyond the previously recorded shift at Period 4. No shipments appear overdue. I use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this trusts long-run demand history while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise and keeps inventory lean given low holding cost (H=$1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Observed historical lead times in concludes have been 0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has softened versus the earlier spike; last 7 periods' demands (P31-P37) average \u224892.3 units which I use to set demand across the review+lead period. Using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on the current regime while keeping L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals. This balances service (capture recent demand) against holding cost by avoiding carryover from older higher-demand periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent weekly demand has moderated from earlier spikes; last 5 concluded demands (P34-P38) = [100,67,75,94,82], mean \u2248 83.6. On-hand=43, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has been observed consistently as 0 in concluded history, so use default lead time to let backend assume 0. To reflect the recent demand regime and reduce excess holding, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures current mean and volatility over the last 5 weeks). This biases ordering toward current demand while the OR engine computes service-level safety stock via profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically (orders consistently arrived same period). A demand regime shift at Period 4 is already recorded in carry-overs; overall historical demand is best summarized by the full-sample mean for a robust forecast. Using promised/default lead time (0) keeps pipeline aligned with observed behavior and avoids overestimating pipeline. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine compute base-stock and caps from full-sample mean/variance, balancing service level (profit/hc ratio) versus holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=95, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0; recent demand has fluctuated but shows no new sustained regime change since the previously recorded Period 4 shift. No shipments are overdue. I select L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) given consistent observed lead times. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; with high profit vs low holding cost this yields a high service-level z* while the cap limits order size. This balances avoiding stockouts (high profit) against modest holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=94, in-transit=0. Historical long-run mean (provided samples) = 110.2, but recent weeks show a sustained lower demand regime: Periods 37-41 demands = [94,82,54,54,55], recent avg = 67.8 (\u2248 -38% vs 110.2) over 5 periods. All concluded lead-time observations show lead_time=0. To adapt to the recent downshift while honoring proven lead time, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, reducing planned replenishment to match the new lower demand and lower holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37: avg (P37-P41)=67.8 vs prior historical avg=110.2 (-38.4%), sustained for 5 periods

No evidence of delayed/lost shipments; observed lead times historically = 0. Set L to default (promised=0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the new lower-demand regime (N chosen = 5 = regime length). This reduces target base-stock and caps orders to avoid excess holding cost given the confirmed demand drop.

On-hand=83, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero; no overdue/lost shipment evidence (historical lead time consistently 0). Use promised lead time to keep OR engine aligned with supplier promise. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (keeps target base-stock lower to avoid excess holding while preserving service for the 5-period demand horizon).

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use default promised L=0. Recent demand shows a lower regime since Period 37 with some volatility (last 5 demands: P40-P44 = 54,55,129,46,45; recent mean ~65.8). To reflect the current lower regime while capturing recent variability, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (covers the most recent cycle including the December spike). This keeps the base-stock tuned to current demand while limiting excess holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

Recent period 45 shows a single large spike (demand=356) but this is not a sustained (>3 periods) regime change; prior confirmed regime shifts are already recorded in carry-over. Therefore use default demand and volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to avoid overreacting to an isolated spike while the pipeline is empty.
