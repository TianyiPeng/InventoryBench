Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows orders consistently arriving same period (arrived messages indicate lead_time = 0), so promised L=0 appears valid. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent periods show a large holiday spike (P45 demand=356) then elevated demand (P46 demand=180) but this looks like a temporary holiday surge rather than a sustained new regime (previous carry-over insights already record earlier sustained regime shifts). OR baseline (cap-adjusted base-stock) recommends 182 units using promised L=0 and historical demand; with profit $19 vs holding $1 the critical fractile is high (q=0.95) so stocking to avoid stockouts is appropriate. Given zero on-hand, low holding cost relative to profit, validated zero lead time, and elevated recent demand, I follow the OR recommendation to replenish to capture demand while accepting modest holding risk. Final action: order 182 units for Period 47.",
