Recent mean (last 3) = 166 u/week, 5-week mean = 145 u/week. Pattern: uptick in mid-Jan then a modest pull-back last week; no sustained regime change. c) Lead time / pipeline: Promised LT=0 but no concluded arrivals exist to verify; treat actual LT as uncertain. Conservative planning uses L=1 (cover current + next period). d) Inventory: On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so all demand must be covered by new order(s). e) Order logic: Balance service level vs. high holding cost ($1/unit/period). Forecast ~150\u2013165 units/week; with L=1 require ~2 weeks cover -> target 300 units. This gives high service probability without extreme overstock given holding cost.",

Recent game observation (Period 1, 2019-02-11) showed a one-time sale of 250 units, but this is a single-period spike and not yet a sustained regime change, so base forecast remains near historical mean while allowing for upside.

With confirmed lead_time=0, orders placed now will arrive in this period and can meet current demand. Inventory decision: target sufficient stock to meet a conservative upper estimate (~200 units) to avoid stockout given recent spike, while limiting holding cost.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (week after peak holiday sales). No product-specific seasonal spike expected this week. Demand history (P43\u2013P46): 50,103,114,69 \u2014 recent mean \u224884 with volatility; prior Dec weeks show low-to-moderate demand. Lead time: confirmed 0 periods historically (orders arrive same period), so an order placed now will be available for Period 47 demand. Inventory: on-hand=51, in-transit=0. Economics: profit $4/unit, holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is costly relative to profit, so avoid large overstock. Order logic: target to cover expected demand (~80) with small safety buffer ~10\u201315% given recent volatility. Order = target(\u224885) \u2212 on-hand(51) \u2248 34.
