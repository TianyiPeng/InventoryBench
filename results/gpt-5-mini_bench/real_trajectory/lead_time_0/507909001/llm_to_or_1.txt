Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~144.6 with moderate variability. Promised lead time remains default. Use default demand/volatility (backend will scale by (1+L)) so orders follow established sample statistics and balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand samples (weekly): [80,144,194,176,129], mean=144.6. Period 1 saw an order of 182 arrive with lead_time=0 and a demand spike to 250 (stockout constrained sales=182). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No sustained changepoint in demand or lead time (only one confirmed arrival). Use promised lead time to keep backend assumptions aligned (L=default). Use default demand moments so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples), allowing OR engine to compute base stock and cap given historical variability while avoiding overreaction to a single high-demand period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $848.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent periods show very high realized demand that exhausts inventory (Period1 demand=250, Period2 demand=454; both periods sold out). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so pipeline provides no cover. Two concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 for orders placed in P1 and P2. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect current evidence (calculate). For demand I use the default historical aggregation (default mu_hat and default sigma_hat) based on the provided sample series (2019-01 weekly data) so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited history and potential demand volatility while the system accumulates more conclude evidence of a sustained regime shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 all arrived same-period (lead_time=0). Recent realized demand (Periods 1\u20133) is substantially higher than earlier Jan samples (period demands: 250, 454, 312 vs Jan avg ~144). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead time (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime and elevated variability so the OR backend raises the base-stock to improve service while accounting for higher volatility.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (orders in P1,P2,P3 arrived same-period). Demand regime shift: Jan sample mean ~144 -> recent Periods 1\u20133 mean = 339 (+136%), sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $643.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P4 arrived same-period). On-hand=213, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Demand regime recently shifted up (Periods 1\u20133 mean \u2248339) but Period 4 dropped to 214; I treat the elevated regime as still relevant and use the most recent 3 periods to capture current demand level and volatility. Set L by calculate to lock in observed lead time=0. Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the short lead and recent higher mean while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variability, balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=239, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Concluded history shows all observed arrivals in Periods 1\u20135 were same-period (lead time=0). Recent demand has shifted from Jan baseline to a higher but now moderating level; last three realized demands (Periods 3\u20135) = 312, 214, 190. To keep orders responsive to the recent downward trend while exploiting same-period replenishment, I set L using observed lead times and set demand mean/volatility based on the most recent 3 periods (captures current regime). This keeps target stock aligned with short lead time to limit holding cost while maintaining service given recent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $571.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=121, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P6 all arrived same-period). Demand shows a recent downturn: last 3 demands (P4\u2013P6)=214,190,173, lower than the earlier 3-period spike. To capture the confirmed same-day lead time use calculated lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N over the latest 3 periods to reflect the new lower regime; same window for demand volatility. These parameters keep orders responsive to the current lower demand while avoiding overstocks given holding cost > 0.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: recent mean (P4\u2013P6)=192 vs prior spike mean (P1\u2013P3)=339 (\u221243%), sustained for 3 periods; Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed P1\u2013P6 orders arrived same-period).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P7 arrived same-period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand shows a return to a lower regime vs initial spike; last 3 concluded demands (P5\u2013P7 = 190,173,255) give the most relevant short-term forecast while capturing current volatility. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock targets reflect the current demand level and variability, balancing service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding excess holding from earlier spike.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has trended high and volatile (Period6\u20138 demands = 173, 255, 354); on-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (sustained). To be responsive to the recent high regime while respecting confirmed same-period arrivals, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0). I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std of the most recent 3 demand observations, which adapts base-stock to the recent demand spike and controls holding cost by using only the recent regime for variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=190, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times remain 0 (orders P1\u2013P9 arrived same-period) so rely on promised lead time. Recent demand has been volatile; last 3 concluded demand samples (Periods 7\u20139 = 255, 354, 147) better reflect the current short-term regime than the older spike/decline patterns. I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent regime, which balances service (using recent higher mean) while limiting holding cost by not overreacting to older extreme spikes. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=122, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals P1\u2013P10 show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same-period). Recent demand (Periods 8\u201310) = [354,147,218], recent mean \u2248239.7; demand has been variable so I use a short recent window to capture current regime. Promised lead time is 0, so set L to default. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to target (1+L)*recent mean and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service (profit/holding \u2192 q=0.8) against holding cost while using the most recent demand regime.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P11) consistently shows actual lead time = 0. On-hand=189, in-transit=0; with confirmed same-period arrivals we can rely on L=0. Demand has moderated from earlier spikes; recent periods (P9\u2013P11) demands = [147,218,140], indicating a stable recent mean ~168. I set L using observed data (calculate confirmed as 0) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime. This keeps base-stock tight to current demand (reducing holding cost) while preserving service through observed variability.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0). Recent demand has settled below early spike; use recent 5-week demand to capture current regime (weeks P8\u2013P12: demands 354,147,218,140,148 \u2192 mean\u2248201, reasonable volatility). Set L to promised/default (0) since arrivals have been reliably same-period. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (q=0.8 \u2192 high service target). This keeps orders responsive to the current demand regime and avoids overstock from earlier spikes.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals \u2192 actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has moved to a lower, stable regime vs initial spike; using recent data best captures current mean/volatility. L: use default (promised 0) to match confirmed same-period arrivals. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=6 (captures Periods 8\u201313 demand mean \u2248186.5 units for (1+L) review+lead). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility. On-hand=167 vs recent mean\u2248186 \u2014 this keeps base stock tuned to recent demand while limiting holding cost given profit/holding ratio ($4/$1).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent concluded demand has softened: Periods 12\u201314 demands = [148,112,86], recent 3-period mean ~115, lower than earlier regime (~192). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history through Period 14. On-hand=176, in-transit=0; given high on-hand vs. recent demand, we should base mu_hat/sigma_hat on the most recent short-run regime to avoid overstocking. I set L via 'calculate' to capture observed lead-time history (will be ~0). I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=3 ( (1+L)*mean of last 3 demands) to reflect the recent lower-demand regime and avoid excess ordering. I choose sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. This combination guides the OR backend to a lower base stock (reducing holding cost) while preserving service for the current lower-demand regime; high on-hand inventory will further cap orders through the engine's pipeline check.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=79, in-transit=0; last order (P15) was 0 so no arrivals expected. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P15) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has settled below the earlier spike; last 8 demand samples (P8\u2013P15) sum=1302, mean\u2248162.8, indicating a sustained lower-demand regime vs the earlier spike. I therefore keep L as default (promised 0) since concluded data confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-spike regime (gives (1+L)*mean \u2248162.8). For volatility I use recent_N N=8 to reflect recent demand variability. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the current lower-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost given confirmed zero lead time and no in-transit stock.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=173, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (P1\u2013P16) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has been below earlier spike levels (last 5 concluded demands: P12\u2013P16 = 148,112,86,97,64 \u2192 lower mean and reduced variance). To avoid excess holding while maintaining service, use promised/default lead time (0) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to capture the current lower-demand regime and its volatility. This keeps the OR base-stock focused on recent demand and reduces over-ordering from earlier high-demand spikes.

Recent demand shows a lower regime than early spikes; using the most recent 3 demand observations (Periods 15\u201317: 97, 64, 189) to capture current demand level and volatility. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=3) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, balancing service level against holding cost given current low on-hand and zero pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand is variable but no evidence of lost shipments and lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I use promised lead time (default) = 0. To capture the recent demand regime and variance (last several weeks show a different average than early Jan), I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (uses the most recent 6 demand samples) so the OR engine bases orders on the current regime and controls holding vs service tradeoff given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Recent demand (Periods 15\u201319 = 97,64,189,176,277) suggests current regime mean higher than original Jan baseline. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands \u2248160.6). I choose sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run std, helping the OR engine size safety stock to balance profit-driven service level vs. holding cost given on-hand=0 and zero pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and variable weekly demand with no new sustained regime shift since Period 7. Current on-hand=131, in-transit=0; on-hand provides buffer for near-term demand. I select L=default to use promised lead time (0) because multiple concluded periods confirm 0 lead time. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast and letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost using the profit/holding ratio.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=144, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed through Period 24). Recent demand has settled lower vs early-year spike; I use recent window to capture current summer regime. Set L=default to rely on promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. Use mu_hat recent_N and sigma_hat recent_N with N=12 (last 12 demand observations, Periods 13\u201324) to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility reflecting the sustained lower-demand regime; this reduces excess ordering versus using early high-spike samples while preserving service against observed variability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=112, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P25) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (same-period arrivals); I therefore use promised/default lead time. Recent demand since Period 13 appears in a lower, stable regime vs the early spike; I choose recent_N for demand using Periods 13\u201325 (N=13) to capture the current mean/volatility. With L=0, mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(recent 13) \u2248 146 units (captures current demand level) and sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current variability. These parameters keep base stock aligned to recent realized demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost >0.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 periods consistently (orders in P1\u2013P26 arrived same-period). Recent demand (Periods 22\u201326 = 178,105,117,92,144) averages ~127 units; this looks like the current regime (no evidence of a new sustained shift). Profit=4, holding=1 (service quantile q=0.8) so OR will target a relatively high service level. I choose L=default to reflect the confirmed 0-period actual lead time and let backend use promised lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 22\u201326) to capture the current lower-demand regime and reduced volatility; this keeps orders aligned with the recent mean and avoids overstock given holding cost. These choices help the OR backend balance service level (via q) against holding costs by forecasting demand and variability from the most recent stable regime.

Recent demand has moderated vs early-year spikes; to be responsive to the most recent demand regime I use recent-N estimates (N=5) for both mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects current weekly demand while keeping holding costs in check. Using promised lead time (default) preserves the confirmed 0-period behavior for the OR engine.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent P1\u2013P28 concludes). Recent demand has shifted upward vs mid-year lull: last 3 concluded demands = [144, 212, 232], mean \u2248196.3 and rising. To respond quickly with same-period replenishment, use promised lead time and let mu/sigma reflect the most recent regime. Methods: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent higher-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 3); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while limiting excess inventory given confirmed zero lead time and recent demand evidence.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

I select L=default to use promised 0. To capture the current demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the most recent 5 weeks' demand (covers current pace and variability) which balances service (capture recent higher demand) against holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has trended up: last 5 period demands (P26\u2013P30)=144,212,232,255,344 -> mean\u2248237; recent regime appears higher than earlier mid-year averages. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0. No overdue or lost shipments. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently confirms 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent higher-demand regime and higher variance so the OR backend raises the base-stock to protect service levels while accounting for holding cost tradeoff (profit=4 vs holding=1 gives moderate service target).

Recent demand has been elevated (P28\u2013P31: 232,255,344,329) indicating a higher recent regime; to capture this shift and reduce stockouts, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on most recent weeks). Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet current demand while the OR engine caps orders; holding vs profit tradeoff is preserved via backend service-level formula (q = profit/(profit+holding)).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend will target a base stock tuned to recent demand and avoid costly stockouts while balancing holding cost.

Recent demand has elevated vs. Jan baseline: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 30\u201334) average \u2248320 units/week, indicating a sustained higher regime. To match observed fast replenishment and recent regime, set L to promised (default = 0) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 samples so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock aligned with current weekly demand while keeping holding costs in check. Volatility likewise uses the recent-5 window to capture current demand variability.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P35) consistently show orders arriving same-period; actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand (Periods 31\u201335 = 329,339,378,208,128) shows a moderately elevated but variable level; using the last 5 observations captures the current regime without overreacting to one-week dips. Set L to default (promised 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to let the OR engine target a base stock tuned to the latest demand mean and variability, balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=238, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0; no missing shipments. Recent demand has dropped from the late-September spike (P31\u2013P33) to a lower stable level in the last 3 periods (P34\u2013P36: 208,128,127). I set L=default to use the promised/observed 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to capture the new lower demand regime (use the most recent 3-period mean/variance) so the OR backend targets service while avoiding excess holding cost given current on-hand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Recent demand has dropped from the late-Sep peak (P30\u2013P33 demand 344\u2013378) to much lower levels in the last three weeks (Periods 35\u201337 demand = 128, 127, 158; recent 3-mean \u2248137). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (0) and base demand forecasts on the most recent 3-week regime to reflect this sustained downward shift while keeping volatility estimation local to the same window. This biases orders down to avoid high holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory and zero pipeline, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 periods (consistent across many periods). Recent demand has settled lower over the last 3 concluded periods (P36\u2013P38 demands = 127, 158, 106). To avoid overstock while keeping service, set lead time to default (promised=0) and forecast using the most recent 3-week regime: mu_hat recent_N N=3; sigma_hat recent_N N=3. This captures the recent lower mean/volatility and limits holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P39 all arrived same-period). Recent demand (Periods 34\u201339 = 208,128,127,158,106,104) shows a lower, stable regime vs earlier high spikes; on-hand=49, in-transit=0 so we must cover only current short-run demand. Choose L=default to trust confirmed same-period supplier behavior. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast on the most recent stable regime (1+L periods \xd7 mean of last 6) and its volatility, which reduces overstock risk while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=76, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and no new sustained changepoint since prior notes. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). Demand has been lower and more variable recently versus the early-year spike; to bias the backend toward recent behavior I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat using the last 10 demand samples. I keep sigma_hat as default to let the backend compute volatility from all samples (sqrt(1+L) scaling). This balances service (using recent mean) while avoiding overfitting volatility estimates and controlling holding costs given current on-hand inventory and zero in-transit.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has settled near ~100\u2013125/week (P37\u2013P41 demands: 158,106,104,96,105) after earlier spikes; on-hand=169, in-transit=0 so current inventory covers ~1.6 weeks of recent demand. No overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history\u2014use promised lead time. I choose L=default to keep backend's lead-time = 0. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent lower-demand regime (reduces excessive ordering vs. earlier high spike). sigma_hat use default (all-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so backend keeps a conservative variability estimate. These settings lower target base-stock to match current lower demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service given q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.8.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand has moderated from the large summer/early-fall peaks; last 4 demands = [104,96,105,150] (avg ~114). On-hand=40, in-transit=0 \u2014 low cover for upcoming week if demand ~100+. Historical lead time repeatedly observed as 0 (concluded P1\u2013P42); use promised lead time. To focus the forecast on the most recent lower-demand regime, set demand estimate using recent_N=5 (captures latest weeks) and match sigma to recent variability (recent_N=5). This keeps base-stock responsive to current lower demand while limiting holding cost ahead of Dec season uncertainty.

Using the last 5 demand samples (P39\u2013P43) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std reflecting current demand and volatility while keeping safety stock low given holding cost > profit tradeoff.
