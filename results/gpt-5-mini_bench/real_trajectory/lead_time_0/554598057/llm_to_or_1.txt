Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is a basic women's T-shirt; recent historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show moderate demand with mean \u224851 units/week and no evidence of a sustained shift or seasonality in this short history. On-hand and in-transit are zero, and promised lead time is 0. No concluded arrivals to suggest actual lead-time deviations or lost shipments. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from the full sample mean/std; this balances service vs holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples mean = 51 (samples: 30,27,70,72,56). Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=0; demand in Period 1 was 70 but sold only 51 due to stockout. Promised lead time=0 and observed lead time so far=0. I choose L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect confirmed short lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples) to avoid overfitting to the single stockout event while letting the OR engine raise order quantities via its service-level formula given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times: Period1 and Period2 arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. Recent demand shows a sharp uptick (last three observed demands: 56, 70, 136) suggesting demand may have increased; I treat this as a recent regime and use recent_N=3 to capture the higher short-run mean and volatility. L uses promised/default (0) consistent with observations. This raises mu_hat to reflect ~87 units/week demand (1+L times recent mean) while sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility, helping the OR backend increase service level for potential spikes while limiting excess holding given high holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly samples (2019-01) show mean demand ~51, but the last 3 concluded periods (P1-P3: demands 70,136,111; dates 2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25) indicate a sustained upward shift. All observed arrivals show actual lead time = 0. To capture the new higher-demand regime while using observed lead-time evidence, set L to calculate (backend will infer average observed lead time = 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the three most recent demand observations, and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to cover the elevated demand while sigma from recent data keeps safety stock aligned with recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed for Periods 1-3 (2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25): recent avg = 105.67 vs prior avg = 51 (+107%), sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $78.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demand has stepped up vs. Jan baseline; last 4 concluded periods demands = [70,136,111,92], on-hand=14, in-transit=0 so no incoming coverage. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility (covers the 4 most recent periods). For lead time I use calculate (average of observed lead times = 0). These settings make mu_hat reflect the elevated recent demand while sigma_hat captures recent variability; using calculate L ensures orders target same-period arrivals as historically observed.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weeks show elevated demand vs Jan baseline: Periods 1-5 demands = [70,136,111,92,70] (recent mean ~95) vs earlier historical mean ~51. On-hand=33, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). I set L to calculate to confirm observed lead time=0 from concluded messages. I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). I also use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters focus the OR backend on serving elevated demand while limiting excess holding cost given low current pipeline and confirmed zero lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand (Periods 4-6 = 92,70,88) shows a lower/stable regime vs earlier spike; all concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 consistently. On-hand=8, in-transit=0 so no overdue shipments. Set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0 from history. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the most recent regime (Periods 4-6) so the base-stock reflects current demand and limits holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times across history are all 0 periods \u2192 use calculate to reflect observed average. Demand has been elevated and more variable recently (recent demands: 70,136,111,92,70,88,144); to capture recent regime and volatility I use recent_N with N=5 to weight the last 5 demand observations for forecast and sigma (balances responsiveness and noise). These parameters aim to raise base-stock to meet higher recent demand while controlling holding cost via a capped order.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently, so set L to calculate to reflect observed lead time. Demand has shown elevated recent levels but the prior carry-over insight already recorded that regime shift; to let the OR engine blend historical and recent variation, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters consistent with observed zero lead time and lets the capped policy balance service vs holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 => no available inventory or incoming. Observed concluded lead times for Periods 1\u20139 are all 0 (orders arrived same period) so use default promised lead time. Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime in Periods 7\u20139 (demands 144,144,136); this is a 3-period sustained increase versus the prior window (Periods 4\u20136 avg 83.33). To respond quickly to the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 3 periods (N=3) so the backend targets service for current elevated demand while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given profit=holding, so we prefer a short recent window rather than long historical averaging.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 7-9 (2019-03-25 to 2019-04-08): recent avg=141.33 vs prior avg(Periods 4-6)=83.33 (+69.5%), sustained for 3 periods.

Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded periods, so use default L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (Periods 7-10) to capture the newest higher mean and volatility and let the OR backend compute base-stock that balances $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent weeks show a clear upward demand regime (Periods 9-11: demand 136,147,212). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover the new high demand. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently, so use default lead time. To capture the confirmed high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime (N=3) to reflect elevated mean and volatility; this biases base-stock upward to avoid lost sales while holding cost equals profit (q=0.5) so safety stock weight is neutral. Using recent_N=3 helps the OR backend respond quickly to the sustained demand spike while avoiding over-reacting to older lower-demand periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile: periods 7-12 demand = [144,144,136,147,212,188] (recent avg \u2248161.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). Observed concluded lead times have all been 0, so set L by calculating the average observed lead time. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast to the latest high-demand regime (captures current mean and volatility over periods 7-12). This raises the base-stock to meet high short-term demand while sigma based on the same recent window prevents underestimating variability; with profit=holding cost, the backend will balance service vs holding via q=0.5.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has stepped up versus early samples (sustained higher regime since late March); on-hand=30, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Keep promised lead time (0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime reflected in the last 6 demand observations (puts weight on April\u2013May spike and current decline), so the backend will raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma from the same window captures increased volatility and avoids excessive understocking given profit=holding cost parity.

Recent demand has settled at a higher regime (Periods 10-14: demands = 147,212,188,132,154; recent mean ~166.6) so I target the recent high-demand regime. Use promised lead time (observed lead times have been 0 each concluded period). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 concluded demand periods) to reflect the sustained elevated demand and recent volatility; this keeps service while limiting excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 every period (no delays). Recent demand (Periods 11-15 = 212,188,132,154,193) is higher and sustained versus earlier regimes. To adapt quickly I use promised lead time (default) and recent demand estimates over the last 5 periods (regime length=5) so the OR engine targets inventory for the current higher-demand regime while keeping holdings controlled. recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat uses N=5 to reflect the recent elevated mean and volatility; L=default keeps model aligned with observed zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 11-15 (2019-04-22 to 2019-05-20): recent avg=175.8 vs prior avg(Periods 7-9)=141.33 (+24.5%), sustained for 5 periods.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent demand has stepped up substantially: carry-over shows sustained regime increases culminating in Periods 11-15 avg=175.8 (+24.5% vs prior). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Use lead time estimate from observed history (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the latest higher-demand regime (most recent 5 demand observations). Use sigma recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to cover the elevated demand while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show actual lead time consistently 0 periods (every concluded arrival reports lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has shifted to a higher regime (carry-over notes); to capture the recent higher mean/volatility I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent sustained regime length) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect latest 5-period demand behavior and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand remains at an elevated regime vs early periods (recent 5-week mean ~186 units/week). On-hand=42, in-transit=0 -> current stock covers only a small fraction of expected demand this period; no evidence of delayed/lost shipments (all concluded lead_times=0). I set L=default to trust the repeatedly observed 0-period lead time, use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to target the latest high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands) and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These choices push the base-stock toward meeting current high demand while reflecting recent variability and avoiding overstating older low-demand periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Promised lead time and all observed lead times = 0, so use default L to keep orders same-period. Set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (uses last 5 realized demands). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to match current demand while avoiding carry of obsolete inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=4, in-transit=0 \u2192 pipeline is essentially empty vs. current weekly demand ~184, so we should size forecasts from the recent high regime. Actual observed lead time has consistently been 0 (arrivals same period), so keep promised lead time. Set L=default to use promised lead time=0; use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility. These choices steer the OR base-stock toward meeting current weekly demand while avoiding over-weighting older low-demand weeks.

I choose N=5 (last 5 demand samples) for mu_hat to reflect the current elevated regime; sigma_hat left as default to let backend scale volatility over (1+L).

On-hand=90, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. All observed lead times have been 0 historically. Given no confirmed lead-time changes or sustained demand shift, use default (promised) lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance. This balances service vs holding cost conservatively until a 3+ period pattern emerges.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=39, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times repeatedly = 0, so L estimate = average observed lead time (0). To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=$1, holding=$1 so q=0.5), I use a short recent window to capture the recent downshift: mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current lower demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters target the base-stock around recent demand (1-week review+lead), reducing overstock risk given current on-hand coverage.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods. Recent demand has dropped since Period 21 (demands: P21=104, P22=79, P23=88, P24=61); this appears to be a new lower regime compared with earlier high-volume weeks. To avoid overstocking given holding cost = profit, set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent lower-demand regime (last 4 periods) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and caps, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for current demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand has declined from the mid-May peak; last 5 weeks (Periods 21-25) demand = [104,79,88,61,44], recent mean ~75.2. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set lead time to default (promised), and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility reflecting the recent softening in demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead_time = 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. No new, sustained demand regime change since previously recorded insights; recent demands show downward variability but not a 3+-period sustained structural shift requiring a new insight. To keep the OR engine's base-stock calculation aligned with long-run data and because profit=holding ($1/$1) implies balanced service/holding tradeoff, use default demand mean and default volatility so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples.

No new confirmed lead-time issues (all concluded lead_times=0 historically).

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 (consistent, no missing shipments). Recent demand has fallen from spring peaks to a summer level: last 5 realized demands (Periods 24-28) = [61,44,66,50,39], recent mean ~52. To avoid excess holding cost given Profit=Holding=$1, set lead time to default (promised 0). Forecast demand using recent 5-week regime: mu_hat recent_N N=5 (covers review+lead period since L=0). Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect current lower volatility. These parameters lower target base-stock to match reduced summer demand and limit holding cost while maintaining service.

All concluded lead times = 0 historically so keep promised lead time. To react to the clear downturn and avoid excess holding cost, use a recent_N demand estimate based on the last 9 weeks (captures the current lower regime) and match sigma to the same recent window to reflect reduced volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand (Periods 21-30) has fallen and stabilized at much lower levels vs the earlier high-demand regime (Periods 11-15). On-hand=45, in-transit=0 so current pipeline is zero. All concluded lead-time observations are 0 periods \u2014 no evidence of delays. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand I use a recent_N estimate over the last 10 periods (regime length = 10) to capture the new lower-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This reduces target base-stock to avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost and sustained lower sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 21-30 (2019-07-01 to 2019-09-02): recent avg=56.5 vs prior avg (Periods 11-15)=175.8 (-67.9%), sustained for 10 periods.

Recent demand regime (Periods 21-30) dropped and is sustained (avg ~56.5 over 10 periods); use recent demand to avoid overstock. No overdue shipments. Set L to default (promised 0) since observed lead times match promise. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (captures the most recent low-demand regime of length 10) so the OR backend targets a lower base-stock and reduces holding cost while maintaining service for current demand level.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (avg \u224856.5 over P21-30) confirmed in carry-over; most recent weeks (P31-32) remain low. On-hand=47, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. I set L via "calculate" because all observed concluded lead times = 0 (so avg=0) \u2014 use observed evidence rather than blind default. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the current low-demand regime (approx P21\u2013P32 length \u224812) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 12 samples, and sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target inventory aligned with the lower demand regime and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service given current verified lower sales.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has fallen sharply vs earlier regimes: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 31-33) = [3, 7, 22], recent 3-avg=10.67 units/week (sustained 3-period low). All historical lead-times observed = 0. To avoid excess holding cost given low recent demand I set L=default (use promised 0). I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent low-demand regime (captures very low current demand). I also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect current observed volatility. These parameters lower target base-stock and cap future order quantities, reducing holding costs while preserving service for the current low-demand environment.

No evidence of lead-time shifts (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To avoid overstocking given profit=holding cost, use the promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent 4 periods to reflect the current low-demand regime.

All concluded orders show actual lead time = 0 historically. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. To reflect the recent low-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the most recent regime; this reduces target base-stock and holding cost risk given low demand and small on-hand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand (Periods 31-36) is much lower than earlier regimes (demands: 3,7,22,9,6,8) indicating a sustained low-demand regime. To keep the OR backend responsive to the current low-demand regime while respecting observed lead time=0, I use promised/default lead time and base mu/sigma on the most recent 6 periods to reflect current demand and its volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-10-28: on-hand=7, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 31-37: 3,7,22,9,6,8,3) and all observed lead times have been 0, so I keep lead time at the promised/default. Use default demand/volatility estimation so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this avoids overfitting to the small recent sample while reflecting long-run variation and lets the backend balance service vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 31 (2019-09-09) through Period 38, so forecast should use the most recent low-demand samples. No evidence of lead-time change or lost shipments (all concluded lead_times = 0). Set L to promised (default). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 31-38). Keep sigma_hat default to avoid overfitting volatility from older high-demand regimes.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 31 (weeks in Sep\u2013Nov): recent weekly sales (Periods 35\u201339) = [6,8,3,8,7], mean=6.4, std\u22482.07. On-hand=77, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs current low demand, so keep lead time at promised value. Set L using default (promised=0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (1+L times recent mean = 6.4). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current low volatility (std\u22482.07). This keeps base_stock small to avoid holding costs while meeting current service expectations.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in the low regime established from Period 31 onward (post-Sept) \u2014 weekly sales mostly single digits (Periods 31-40 avg ~7-45 with recent weeks ~7-9), and on-hand=70, in-transit=0. All concluded lead-time observations are 0, so use promised lead time. To align the OR base-stock to the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 31-40, length=10). This keeps forecast and volatility anchored to current low demand and avoids overstocking given equal profit and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in a low, stable regime since Period 31 (weekly demand ~3\u20139); on-hand=62, in-transit=0 so we have ample cover for current low demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 31\u201341, length=11), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and volatility from the most recent low-demand samples, reducing excess safety stock and holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 31 (September) with weekly demands mostly single- to low-double digits; on-hand=47, in-transit=0. No concluded late arrivals or lost-shipment signals\u2014promised lead time remains appropriate. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 (capture the post-Period-31 low-demand regime: Periods 31\u201342) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent consistent regime, reducing overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has been very low since Period 31 (P31\u2013P43 avg \u22488.08 over 13 weeks) after prior summer declines; no shipments currently en route. To avoid excess holding cost (holding=$1 equals profit per unit) I keep promised lead time and downweight long-history demand: choose L=default (use promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=13 (covers the sustained low-demand regime P31\u2013P43) so mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean of last 13 samples, and sigma_hat recent_N N=13 to reflect volatility in this low-demand regime. This keeps target base-stock low and caps ordering to prevent overstock while preserving service given current low demand and zero pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand collapsed to a new low regime from Period 31\u201343 (2019-09-09 to 2019-12-02): avg demand = 8.08 over 13 periods vs prior regime avg (P21\u2013P30) = 56.5 (\u221285.7%), sustained for 13 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 31 with sustained low weekly sales (Periods 31\u201343 avg ~8.08 over 13 periods) and recent weeks (Periods 32\u201344) continuing low demand; on-hand=40, in-transit=0. Lead time historically observed as 0 in all concluded periods, so keep L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand parameters to capture the persistent low-demand regime: detect regime length = 13 (Periods 31\u201343), set N=13 to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 13 demand samples so the OR engine targets much lower base stock and avoids excess holding cost. This reduces overstock risk given holding cost equals profit. Parameters trade higher service from older high-demand data for lower holding cost aligned with confirmed low-demand regime.

All observed lead times have been 0 historically.

Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show a sustained low-demand regime since Period 31 (avg \u22488.08 over 13 periods). No evidence of lead-time drift (many past orders had lead_time=0). To avoid excess holding cost given Profit=Holding ($1), keep promised lead time and set demand estimates from the recent low regime. Therefore: L=default; mu_hat use recent_N with N=13 to reflect the 13-period low-demand regime; sigma_hat use recent_N with N=13 to capture recent volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned with the confirmed low-demand regime and minimizes unnecessary holding.
