Lead time: supplier promised 0 but actual lead time unknown; arrivals will be confirmed only in conclude messages, so we cannot rely on past confirmed lead-time evidence. Forecast: recent mean ~65 but with upward momentum and a one-week spike to 113; conservatively expect demand this period ~80\u2013100 units. Cost tradeoff: Profit = $1/unit sold, Holding = $1/unit/period \u2014 unsold units immediately cost as much as the profit, so overstock is very costly. Action logic: balance capturing likely sales from the recent uptick while avoiding large leftover inventory. Place an order to cover expected demand near the midpoint of the forecast range.",
