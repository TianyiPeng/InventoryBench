Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unknown (no concluded arrivals yet), so assume potential >=0; be conservative and cover at least one week of expected demand plus a small safety stock. Profit per unit ($19) far exceeds holding cost ($1/period), so it's preferable to stock to avoid lost sales rather than under-order.
