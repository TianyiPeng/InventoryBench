Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (weekly cadence). Recent historical weekly demand samples avg=35 (values: 18,31,46,46,34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time shifts or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and use full-sample defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this provides a neutral forecast given no evidence of a regime change and balances service level vs holding cost for a low-profit ($4) / holding ($1) SKU.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (observed lead_time=0). Demand history (samples mean=35) suggests baseline weekly demand ~35. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (recent evidence = 0). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, providing a baseline replenishment that balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand observed: Period1=46, Period2=46; historical sample mean=35 (samples: 18,31,46,46,34). Lead time observed in concluded periods is consistently 0 (two observations). On-hand=1, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (observed lead_time=0). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to bias toward the more recent higher demand (last 3 samples: 46,46,34 \u2192 mean=42) so the base-stock reflects the uptick while still using some history. I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. This balances higher service for the recent demand spike against holding cost; no strong multi-period regime change yet, so no carry-over insight recorded.

Daily Profit: $152.00, Daily Holding Cost: $10.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $142.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived same period (lead_time=0 each), so actual lead time appears to be 0. Recent demand (concluded sales) over Periods 1-3 = [45,46,38] (mean ~43.0) which is higher than earlier Jan samples; I treat the last 3 periods as the current regime. Set L to recent average observed lead time to reflect confirmed 0. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the current higher-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 3 samples). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock aligned with the observed fast lead time and recent demand, avoiding understock given stronger recent sales while not inflating safety stock from older low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1/P2/P3 orders arrived in same period they were ordered).

Daily Profit: $172.00, Daily Holding Cost: $5.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $167.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals and ending on-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean = (18+31+46+46+34)/5 = 35 units/week; recent realized weekly demand in concluded periods: 46,46,38,43 (consistent with mean ~43 but limited sample). Profit/holding ratio implies high service target (q=4/(4+1)=0.8). I choose conservative/default statistics to let the OR engine compute base-stock using promised lead time (0) and the full-sample mean/std to avoid overfitting to a short recent spike. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high profit) while not inflating safety stock from a small recent uptick. On-hand (5) + in-transit (0) is well below the full-sample mean (35), so the OR engine will raise orders accordingly.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed across P1\u2013P5). On-hand=16, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand sequence from concluded periods: [46,46,38,43,31]. Promised lead time 0 is reliable. Use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine set base-stock balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1). This keeps parameters aligned with observed zero lead time and recent demand without overfitting short-term noise.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Concluded history (Periods 1-6) consistently shows arrivals same period as orders -> actual lead time = 0. Given stable recent arrivals and available historical demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std automatically. This ensures base_stock balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while covering current-period demand (L+1 periods) with minimal manual tuning.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20137) shows arrivals always same-period (lead time observed=0). Demand has been stable in recent weeks (weekly samples provided). On-hand=4, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Use promised/default lead time and population historical demand to let backend compute base-stock: this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) using the OR formula without forcing extra safety from ad-hoc higher L or inflated \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (from snapshot) have mean \u224835 units; recent single-week spike to 68 (Period 8) is not yet a sustained regime change. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I therefore keep L at default (promised=0) and use default demand dispersion and mean (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service (captures typical demand) while avoiding overreacting to a one-week surge.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) = [31,43,42,68,30] with mean ~42.8; on-hand=21, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments observed (all prior orders concluded same period). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To capture recent variability (including the week with a 68 spike) I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 so the backend bases base-stock on the most recent regime; sigma_hat left as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). L kept default (promised lead time=0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period delivery. These parameters balance service (covering current demand volatility) against holding cost by reflecting recent demand while relying on the OR engine's capped ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Recent demand is higher and volatile (last 5 demands = 43, 42, 68, 30, 52; mean=47), so use a short recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so keep default promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current mean/volatility and let the OR backend compute base_stock and cap accordingly to balance service level (protect against stockouts from recent high demand) versus holding cost.

Recent demands have ranged ~18\u201368 with mean ~35 (historical sample mean). Given no evidence of regime change and confirmed 0 lead time, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes base-stock from full-sample stats; this balances service (promised 0 LT) against holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201312) shows every order arrived same period ordered (lead time observed=0 consistently). On-hand=5, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history (provided samples and recent periods) centers around ~35 units/week with occasional spikes (e.g., Period 8 demand=68). Given confirmed same-period arrivals and no evidence of a new regime, use historical averages: set lead time to be inferred from observations and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples. This balances service (use confirmed short lead time) vs holding cost by not inflating safety stock absent sustained demand shift.

To keep the OR engine aligned with observed behavior and avoid stockouts given zero pipeline, use promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (captures baseline demand variability).

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment that covers current period demand. Use default lead time to keep backend aligned with promised 0 and use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base_stock and cap from full-sample statistics. No evidence of a sustained change in demand mean/variance requiring a recent_N or EWMA adjustment.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over). Demand history shows mostly weekly demands in the 30\u201360 range with one isolated spike (Period 16 demand=101) \u2014 not a sustained regime change. No overdue shipments. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed reliable same-period fulfillment and stable demand, I use default lead time (promised = 0) and default demand estimates (use full-sample mean and std scaled by 1+L). This balances service (cover typical 1-period demand) vs. holding cost without overreacting to a single spike.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P17 arrived same period). Recent demand shows two large spikes (P16=101, P17=103) but this is only 2 periods so not a sustained regime change. To be conservative and because lead time is confirmed at 0, use default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) so the OR backend can apply its base-stock calculation without overreacting to a short spike.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders consistently arriving same period (lead time=0). Recent demand has risen and become more volatile (last 5 demands: 55,57,101,103,88; mean ~80.8) so I target recent sample stats to capture current regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the elevated mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 across many concluded periods) and a clear upward demand trend since mid-May (several large weeks) but no missing shipments or in-transit stock (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0 lead time. I select default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std; this balances using full-sample stability while the backend's cap will limit overly-large orders. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments are needed.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained, large upward shift starting Period 16 (weeks ending 2019-05-27 onward). Use promised lead time (default L=0) \u2014 confirmed historically \u2014 and set demand estimates using the most recent regime to capture the higher mean/variance. Chose recent_N with N=5 (Periods 16-20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base stock sized for the new high-demand regime and balances service vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 16: avg demand increased from 46.9 (Periods 1\u201315) to 119.4 (Periods 16\u201320), +154% (sustained over 5 periods)

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (periods 16\u201321 demands: 101,103,88,136,169,140) \u2014 significantly above earlier mean. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand parameters with N=6 (the six most recent high-demand samples). L set to default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm 0 lead time. Using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR base-stock on the current high-demand regime to avoid stockouts while holding cost remains moderate (profit $4 vs holding $1), balancing service level against inventory cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained P1\u2013P22). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 16 (Periods 16\u201322 recent demands: 101,103,88,136,169,140,69; regime length=7). To capture the new higher mean and recent volatility, set L to default (promised lead time=0) and use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the 7-period recent regime. This balances higher service needs from the sustained demand increase against holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16 (Periods 16\u201320 avg=119.4 vs Periods 1\u201315 avg=46.9, +154%). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. I therefore keep L at default (promised=0). To capture the post-shift higher demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (the recent regime from Periods 16\u201323, regime length=8) so the OR engine uses the elevated mean/volatility rather than older low-demand history. This balances higher service level against holding cost given current on-hand and no in-transit units.

Use recent_N for demand estimates using the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201324, length=9) so the OR engine targets the new higher mean while sigma uses the same recent window to capture increased volatility. This balances higher service level against holding cost given current low on-hand inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 16: avg rose from 46.9 (P1\u201315) to 119.4 (P16\u201320) (+154%) and high weekly demand continued through P25. On-hand=42, in-transit=0 so available stock covers well under one week of the new regime. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 0. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=10 (regime length P16\u2013P25 = 10 weeks \u2192 N=10 per rules). sigma_hat also uses recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to protect service given very profitable units (profit $4 vs holding $1) while using recent data to avoid overreacting to older low-demand periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 16 (avg up ~+154%) and confirmed lead time 0. On-hand = 93, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. To let the OR backend compute base-stock using full historical mean/volatility while respecting confirmed same-period arrivals, I choose default lead time and default demand estimates so the engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service (captures elevated demand via historical samples) against holding costs given current ample on-hand inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand regime (Periods 16\u201327) is persistently higher than early periods (sustained spike starting P16). On-hand=49, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historical concludes confirm 0. To capture the higher recent mean/volatility, set L to default (promised 0) and compute demand over the recent high-demand regime. Chosen methods: L=default to trust confirmed 0 lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=12 to use periods 16\u201327 (12 samples) and reflect the elevated mean across the (1+L) review+lead window; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts during the new regime while keeping holding cost visible via the backend's cap.

Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (Period 4 insight) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (higher mean through recent periods). I keep L at default (promised lead time = 0) since multiple concluded arrivals confirm 0. To capture the post-changepoint higher demand I use recent_N with N=13 (regime from Period 16\u201328, length=13) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts over the (1+L) review+lead window using only the elevated-demand regime samples, improving service while controlling holding cost given current healthy on-hand stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201329 arrivals same period ordered). Recent demand shows a higher regime vs early history; I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to capture the current demand level (last 5 observed demands: P25\u2013P29 = 99,45,49,55,85 \u2192 mean ~66.6). Using L=default (promised 0) preserves confirmed fast replenishment; mu_hat and sigma_hat set from recent_N=5 to make base_stock responsive to the elevated recent demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand periods. This balances service (meet current high demand) vs holding cost given on-hand=45 and no in-transit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=1, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible this period. Historical concluded data confirms actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 16 (higher mean). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history repeatedly shows 0 lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=15 (the recent regime from Period 16\u201330, regime length=15) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the post-changepoint samples; this captures the sustained higher demand while keeping variability informed by the same window. This balances higher target base-stock to avoid stockouts against holding cost given current low on-hand and no in-transit stock.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=0 (earlier carry-over). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift up around Period 16; recent weeks (last 5 demands) show mean \u224870.6 and moderate volatility. No overdue shipments. I set L=default to use the promised/observed 0-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current post-shift demand regime and recent volatility, which helps the OR backend set a base-stock that improves service for higher recent demand while limiting excess holding given the $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P32) repeatedly show arrived=ordered in same period \u2192 actual lead time confirmed as 0. A sustained demand regime shift occurred at Period 16 (higher mean from P16 onward); recent behavior (Periods 16\u201332, length=17) should drive forecasts. Therefore: set L by calculating observed lead times (will be 0). Use recent_N with N=17 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint mean and volatility (N chosen = regime_length = 17, capped rules satisfied). This biases the base-stock toward the higher recent demand while sigma_hat reflects recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 16 (confirmed earlier). On-hand=38, in-transit=0; promised lead time = 0 and prior concludes confirm actual L=0. Given the regime shift, I use recent samples from the high-demand regime (Periods 16\u201333) to set demand estimates so the OR engine targets service without excess holding (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 moderate service level). Methods: L=default to keep lead time = promised (0) consistent with observed zero LT; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=18 (covering Periods 16\u201333, regime_length=18) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the new higher-demand regime and its volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=99, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201334). Demand regime increased mid-year (Periods 16\u201320) but recent weeks (Periods 30\u201334 demands = 86,78,41,85,22) show a lower, variable level. To keep responsiveness to the most recent demand pattern while respecting confirmed LT=0, I set L=default, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the latest demand mean and volatility (covers the review+lead period = 1 week). This reduces overstock risk vs. using the earlier high-demand regime.

I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201335) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher mean and variability; this avoids diluting the forecast with low pre-shift demand. No evidence of missing shipments currently (arrivals consistently concluded), so defaults on lost-order handling not needed.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Historical lead times consistently 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Recent demand has fallen: last 3 concluded demands = 22, 18, 21 \u2192 low short-run demand. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, keep L=default (promised 0) and set demand forecast using the most recent 3 observations to reflect the current low regime. Use recent_N N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes a conservative base-stock and tight cap given current low demand and high inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weeks show low demand (Periods 35-37: 18,21,25) after the earlier sustained regime shift (Periods 16-20). On-hand=72, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level using full historical sample while current on-hand inventory (72) already provides cover for short-term low demand, avoiding aggressive fresh orders given holding cost=$1 and moderate unit profit=$4.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=63, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (orders have arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 34\u201338 = 22,18,21,25,30) shows a sustained downshift over 5 periods (mean \u2248 23.2) versus the prior high regime. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use promised lead time (default L=0) and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the new low-demand regime. sigma_hat also computed from the most recent 5 samples to reflect reduced volatility. This keeps base-stock conservative and prevents overstock given current on-hand=63 and no in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: avg demand decreased to 23.2 (Periods 34\u201338) from prior summer regime (~119.4 in Periods 16\u201320), sustained over 5 periods (-81%).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has stayed in the low regime since Period 34 (demands P34\u2013P39 = 22,18,21,25,30,22; avg=23.0), a sustained drop vs. prior summer spike. On-hand=41, in-transit=0 \u2192 on-hand already covers ~1.8 weeks at current demand. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals same period). I therefore use promised lead time (default=0) and set demand estimates using the recent low-demand regime (recent_N N=6) to reflect the new mean/volatility; using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine size orders to cover (1+L) periods of the current regime and avoid excess holding cost while protecting service level.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 34 (recent weekly demands: P34\u2013P40 = 22,18,21,25,30,22,21). I set L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (regime length=7) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent low-demand samples, avoiding overstock from prior high-demand periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows the sustained low-demand regime beginning at Period 34 (weekly demands mostly 18\u201330). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. On-hand=8, in-transit=0; expected single-period demand \u2248 mean of recent low regime. To avoid overstock given $1 holding vs $4 profit, keep promised lead time (default 0) and base demand estimates on the most recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (covering Periods 34\u201341) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent low-demand samples, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; last conclude (P42) showed a stockout (demand=107, sold=26) so P42 demand is censored by availability. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained P1\u2013P42 evidence). Demand regime: earlier summer spike then a sustained low-demand regime starting at Period 34 (Periods 34\u201342 low demand). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (confirmed as 0 by arrivals). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N over the current low-demand regime (detect changepoint at Period 34); regime length = 9 (Periods 34\u201342), so N=9 to focus forecast and volatility on the low-demand regime and avoid being pulled by the prior high summer demand. This keeps target base-stock lower to reduce holding costs while matching current lower demand; using recent samples also helps limit overordering given the P42 stockout censoring risk.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (sustained). Recent demand shows a low-demand regime since Period 34 (avg ~23) with an isolated spike at Period 42 (107) that is not sustained; avoid overreacting to that single spike. Use promised lead time (default=0). For demand level, use EWMA to smooth the isolated spike (gamma=0.3). For volatility use recent_N over the last 5 concluded demand samples to capture current low-demand variability including the outlier. These choices keep baseline target low to limit holding cost while smoothing transient surge risk.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time = 0 periods (sustained across many periods). Recent demand has been in the low post-Period-34 regime with one large spike (Period 42). To be responsive to the current low-demand regime while smoothing the isolated spike, I use recent_N=5 for mean and volatility (captures the most recent week-to-week behavior). Using promised/default lead time (0) aligns with confirmed arrivals and avoids inflating pipeline coverage. These settings help the OR backend set a modest base-stock tuned to recent low demand while accounting for short-term variability.

No new sustained demand regime shift detected since prior carry-over insights. To avoid overreacting to isolated spikes (e.g., Period 42) and let the OR engine blend long-run demand with observed variability, I use default lead time and default demand estimates so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given mixed historical regimes and current moderate on-hand stock.
