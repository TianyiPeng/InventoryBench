======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead time: confirmed L=0 (carry-over). Current on-hand=92, in-transit=0. OR recommends 64 (uses historical mean); recent demands P42\u2013P46 = [143,54,34,64,46], 5-period average \u224868. On-hand (92) comfortably exceeds one-period demand plus safety stock implied by OR. With holding cost $1/unit/period and profit $19, excess ordering risks negative contribution from holding without increasing sales. No evidence of lost shipments or impending spike (recent spike in P42 already followed by replenishment P43). Therefore place 0 order to avoid unnecessary inventory while meeting expected demand this period.",
