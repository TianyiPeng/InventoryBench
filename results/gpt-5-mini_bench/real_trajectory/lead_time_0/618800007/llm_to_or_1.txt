Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show a stable mean \u224864.8. Promised lead time = 0; profit and holding cost are equal (profit=1, holding=1) implying target service quantile q=0.5 (no safety stock from z). Use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this keeps orders aligned with observed average demand while avoiding extra inventory given symmetric cost tradeoff.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). History: Period 1 order of 65 arrived in Period 1 (observed lead_time=0). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean \u224864.8; Period 1 demand=60 consistent with history. No sustained changepoint in demand or lead time detected. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend treats L=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). This keeps replenishment aligned with historical weekly demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 arrived in the same period (observed lead_times = 0), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand: recent week spike to 121 (Period 2) above prior Jan samples (84,68,51,53,68) but spike is not sustained (only one high week), so I will keep demand estimate based on all samples rather than reactively up-weighting recent demand. Using calculated L (average observed lead times) and default mu/sigma (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) balances service vs holding cost given limited evidence of a regime shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $73.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0; concluded history shows orders placed P1-P3 all arrived with lead_time=0 (consistent). Recent periods show a sustained increase in demand versus Jan samples (recent demand samples: 60, 121, 110 \u2014 average ~97 vs Jan historical mean ~65). Some sales are censored by stockouts in Periods 2-3 (sold < demand), so I conservatively use the last 3 periods to capture the new higher regime. No overdue shipments detected. I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the higher recent mean and volatility so the OR backend raises the base stock while keeping cap based on its formula.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: recent Periods 1-3 demand avg ~97 vs Jan sample avg ~65 (+49%); evidence: demands 60,121,110 (P1-P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $97.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (Jan) mean ~65, but recent selling periods (P1-P4) show elevated demand: 60,121,110,115 (avg ~101.5) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in prior periods arrived same period). I set L=default to trust promised 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over last 4 weeks). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=4) to reflect increased volatility in recent weeks. These parameters steer the OR backend toward a higher base_stock to reduce stockouts during the confirmed elevated-demand regime while using recent volatility to avoid excessive overstock given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent weeks show a sustained upward demand regime versus Jan samples: recent demands = [60,121,110,115,101] (avg ~101). On-hand=1, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and all observed lead_times = 0. I set L=default to trust the promised 0 given consistent observed 0s. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent higher-demand regime (5 most recent periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend base-stock and cap reflect the new higher mean and updated volatility, balancing service-level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand has shifted materially above Jan baseline: last 6 realized weekly demands = [60,121,110,115,101,111], mean \u2248103. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; no overdue arrivals. Observed concluded lead times across periods 1-6 are all 0, so use calculated lead time. To reflect the sustained higher recent demand, set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 6 samples so the backend sizes base-stock to current demand levels; use recent_N for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This increases service while avoiding excess holding by relying on recent data and the backend cap.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2192 no coverage. Recent realized demands show a sustained higher regime since Period 4 (demands P4-P7: 115,101,111,117; avg \u2248111) vs earlier sample avg \u224865. All observed lead times = 0. I set L by averaging observed lead times to let backend confirm (calculate). To capture the new, higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) so the OR engine sizes base stock and safety stock based on the most recent 4-period demand regime, balancing service (higher mean) against holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P8 arrived with 0 periods), so use promised/default lead time. Demand shows a sustained upward regime starting around Period 4 (previous carry-over): recent demands P4\u2013P8 = [115,101,111,117,228], recent average elevated vs earlier sample. To capture the new regime while keeping variability reflective of the last five weeks (including the large P8 spike), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR backend bases base_stock and cap on the most recent demand regime and observed volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given higher recent demand) against holding cost by not overreacting to a single extreme beyond the 5-week window.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has shifted upward since Period 4 (post-Jan samples): recent demands P4-P9 = 115,101,111,117,228,103 (mean \u2248129.2). Current on-hand=32, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals expected this period. Promised lead time historically observed as 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period), so use L=default. To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the 6 most recent periods (N=6) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean based on the elevated mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility (including the 228 spike). These choices raise target base-stock and safety stock to reduce stockouts given sustained higher demand while letting the OR backend apply the capped order to limit excess holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=6, in-transit=0; historically observed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals were same-period). I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new higher regime (gives (1+L)\xd7mean based on most recent behavior) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect elevated recent volatility. These choices raise target base stock to improve service in the new regime while using recent variance to limit overstock from the large spike.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime vs the Jan sample set (multiple weeks of >100 demand, including a 228 spike). Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default L. Backlog/risk: no in-transit stock and only 13 on-hand, so set demand forecast using recent data to capture the elevated mean and volatility. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals; mu_hat=recent_N (N=11) to base forecast on the last 11 demand observations (captures sustained higher demand); sigma_hat=recent_N (N=11) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters instruct the OR backend to raise the base-stock to meet the new regime while the sigma estimate controls safety-stock vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed from Period 1\u201311: avg demand \u2248119 vs Jan sample avg 65 (+83%), sustained high-demand regime including a 228 spike.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (orders from P1\u2013P12 arrived same period) so use promised/observed lead time = 0. Demand has shifted to a higher sustained regime (Periods 1\u201312 show elevated weekly demand vs Jan baseline, confirmed in carry-over). To capture the current regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 11 concluded demand samples (Periods 1\u201311/12) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock and cap reflect the sustained higher mean and observed volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost by limiting horizon to recent data rather than all historical samples.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u201313), so use default L. Demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime vs Jan samples: carry-over confirms avg \u2248119 through Period 12 with continued elevated weekly demand (Periods 1\u201312). Use recent_N to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent sustained regime (N=11 covers the confirmed high-demand run) so the OR engine stocks for the higher mean and observed volatility, balancing service (profit=holding cost) by sizing base stock to recent demand and variability.

Historical concluded arrivals show every order from Periods 1\u201314 arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 consistently), so use observed-average lead time. Demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime since early periods (carry-over notes); to capture recent regime I use recent_N on demand and volatility using the last 10 samples (Periods 5\u201314) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat across the review+lead horizon. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the higher recent mean while measuring recent volatility for safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Demand has been in a sustained higher regime vs Jan samples; recent variability remains elevated. To adapt quickly to the current regime while keeping safety buffer small (profit=holding so balanced), I use promised lead time (default) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 demand observations to reflect the current mean and volatility without over-weighting older low-demand weeks.

Historical concluded arrivals show all observed lead_times = 0 (orders P1\u2013P16 arrived same period), so set L via calculate to confirm actual lead time=0. Demand has shifted to a sustained higher regime vs. Jan samples (carry-over notes); use recent demand to forecast. I choose mu_hat recent_N=11 and sigma_hat recent_N=11 to base the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the last 11 realized weekly demands (captures the confirmed high-demand regime while smoothing week-to-week spikes). With L=0 this targets next-period service while limiting holding cost given profit=holding cost; these parameters bias the OR backend toward matching recent realized demand and avoiding excess inventory given zero pipeline.

Demand has been in a sustained higher regime vs Jan samples (carry-over insight previously recorded). I select L by calculating average observed lead time (captures confirmed 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to emphasize the most recent demand regime and avoid diluting with old low-Jan samples. sigma_hat left as default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while using observed lead time and conservative variability for the OR backend.

Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand plus lead. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so use calculated lead time from observed data. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime vs Jan samples (carry-over notes); to be responsive to recent demand levels I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (focus on latest 10 demand observations) so the OR backend builds a base-stock that reflects the elevated recent mean and recent volatility. This keeps service high while avoiding excess holding when demand recedes.

Date 2019-07-01. Recent demand has moderated from the high regime but remains above Jan sample average; last 5 demands (P16-P20)=117,80,65,95,98 (mean=91). On-hand=9, in-transit=0 so we need to cover current period demand plus maintain service. Use promised lead time (default L=0) since all concluded lead times =0. Forecast demand using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current moderate regime. Use recent_N for sigma (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep base_stock responsive to the recent mean while limiting holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period (orders always arrived same period). On-hand=17, in-transit=0 so no confirmed incoming supply; no overdue/lost shipments. Demand has settled lower than the earlier spike: last 10 concluded demands (P12\u2013P21) average \u224899. To reflect the recent regime and avoid overstock, set L by calculation of observed lead times, and set demand forecast and volatility using recent_N over the last 10 periods (captures post-spike stabilization). These parameters bias ordering toward recent realized demand while the OR backend will compute safety stock from profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Historical lead times observed consistently 0. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time of 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-summer regime (reduces overstock risk vs using full-sample mean). Sigma also set recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward meeting near-term demand while limiting holding cost given profit=holding.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2014 no evidence of delays, so use promised/default lead time. Demand has declined in the last 3 weeks (Periods 21-23 demands = 74, 43, 31; recent avg ~49) versus the earlier high-demand regime; this looks like a sustained short-term downward shift (summer). To react quickly, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 weeks so the OR engine reduces ordering and holding. Using recent_N=3 captures current lower mean and lower volatility, balancing service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders from Periods 1\u201324 arrived same period). Demand has recently dropped vs earlier high regime: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 21\u201324) = 74,43,31,55 (avg \u224850.8), well below the previously confirmed high-demand regime (~119). To react quickly to the recent lower summer demand while respecting the proven lead time=0, I keep L at default (promised=0) and set demand forecasts using a recent-window estimate (focus on last N=4 periods) so the backend reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding cost. I also use recent_N for sigma_hat to reflect lower recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: recent Periods 21-24 avg \u224850.8 vs prior confirmed avg \u2248119 (\u221257%), sustained low-demand regime over 4 periods.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent history (Periods 21\u201325) shows a sustained low-demand regime (avg \u224850.0 over last 5 periods: 74,43,31,55,47) versus earlier high regime. All observed lead times have been 0 historically. On-hand=4, in-transit=0. To align the OR backend with the recent lower demand and avoid excess inventory holding, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the (1+L) forecast on the last 5 periods' mean, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This reduces target base stock to match the new low-demand regime and limits over-ordering given holding cost equals profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders in concludes always arrived same period). Recent demand has shifted to a lower regime since Period 25 (demands: P24=55, P25=47, P26=48). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new low-demand regime (recent mean \u224850), and match sigma_hat to recent volatility over the same 3 periods. These choices steer the OR backend toward much smaller base-stock appropriate for sustained lower demand, reducing holding cost risk while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 21; last 7 demands = [74,43,31,55,47,48,29], recent mean \u224846.7. All observed lead times remain 0. To respond to the sustained lower-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost, I use promised lead time (default) and estimate demand and volatility from the last 7 periods (recent_N, N=7). This keeps the OR backend's base-stock and cap responsive to the new lower mean and reduced variability, improving profit net of holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Low-demand regime confirmed: Period 21\u201327 avg demand \u224846.7 vs prior confirmed avg \u2248119 (\u221261%), sustained over 7 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

I therefore use promised lead time (default=0) and base mu/sigma on the recent low-demand regime to avoid overstock: use recent_N with N=7 (the 7-period low-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant recent data, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 periods. Recent history (Periods 21\u201329) shows a sustained low-demand regime (carry-over confirmed earlier: avg \u224846.7 over P21\u201327) and recent demands remain low (last 9 demands P21\u2013P29 average \u224846). I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (use the last 9 demand samples to capture the current low-demand regime and lower variability), so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over that recent window. This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service for the sustained lower demand environment.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P30 all arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. Demand shows a sustained low-demand regime since around Period 21; recent 10-week average best represents current demand (captures Periods 21\u201330). Therefore set L=default, mu_hat=recent_N (N=10) to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility\u2014this reduces target base-stock and holding cost while preserving service during the sustained low regime. On-hand=17 and in-transit=0 noted; parameters aim to avoid overstock given low recent demand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 25 (Period 25\u201331 avg \u224847). Recent week demand (P29\u2013P31 = 52,30,23) continues lower. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0) given consistent evidence. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (use last 7 concluded periods), which reduces forecast and safety stock to avoid excess holding cost while still covering near-term demand variability.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has settled into the low-demand regime established in Jul\u2013Sep (periods 21\u201332): recent weekly sales mostly in the 20\u201350 range (periods 26\u201332: 48,29,42,52,30,23,20) vs earlier high-regime ~119. On-hand=19, in-transit=0 so we must reorder to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand; promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0 so use default L. To keep responsiveness to the recent low regime while smoothing noise, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 7 samples (N=7 captures the current low regime length while satisfying min 3). This biases the OR backend toward a lower base stock (reducing holding cost) but keeps safety for short spikes observed recently.

Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 25 (recent periods show low weekly demand: P25\u2013P35 average \u224846.7 then falling; last 11 periods reflect the low regime). Use promised lead time (default L=0). For demand forecast use recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime to capture current lower mean and reduced volatility: set mu_hat recent_N N=11 and sigma_hat recent_N N=11. This biases orders down to avoid excess holding cost while covering expected (L+1) periods of current low demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (confirmed in carry-over): recent weeks demand well below earlier high regime. Current on-hand=23, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Use promised lead time (0) since all concluded lead times = 0. Forecast demand using recent data to reflect the persistent low regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 16 periods (Period 21\u201336) to capture current lower mean and reduced volatility. This reduces ordering targets and holding cost while preserving service given low demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Historical concluded lead times = 0 every period (orders arrived same period) so keep promised lead time. Demand has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (Period 21\u201337 avg \u224846.7), so I rely on recent samples rather than all-sample mean. On-hand=27, in-transit=0; using recent_N=17 (periods 21\u201337) for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the sustained lower mean/volatility to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 25 (confirmed Period 28) \u2014 recent sells are very low (Periods 36\u201338: 10,9,9). I set L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime while smoothing week-to-week noise. sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock to match the sustained lower demand and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a sustained low-demand regime since Period 28 (recent demands: P30\u2013P39 = 30,23,20,42,15,6,10,9,9,15; 10 most recent avg \u224817.9). Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded orders had lead_time 0). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the low-demand regime (use most recent ~12 samples since the changepoint at P28) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current low mean and reduced volatility, reducing overstock risk and holding cost while maintaining service. This balances profit vs. holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 25 with recent demands: P34\u2013P40 = [15,6,10,9,9,15,18] (avg \u224811.7). On-hand=5, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0. I keep L as default (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically and no missing shipments. To reflect the persistent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (N=7 covers the most recent week-long regime). Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) reduces target base stock and holding cost exposure while preserving service for the observed lower demand. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has settled into the low-demand regime confirmed earlier (Periods 21\u201327 onward). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover (1+L) periods. All observed lead times are 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Use recent_N=7 for demand mean and std to reflect the sustained lower-volume regime (weeks 35\u201341 contain consistently low demands: 6,10,9,9,15,18,12), which reduces target base-stock and holding cost risk while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding given profit=holding cost ($1 each).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 36-42) shows a sustained lower regime vs earlier high-season: recent demands = [10,9,9,15,18,12,31], recent average \u224813.4 vs historical Jan avg \u224865. No evidence of lost shipments (arrivals have matched orders). I set L=default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the OR forecast to the most recent low-demand regime while allowing some weight on the 31 spike; this reduces overstock risk given equal profit and holding cost and current zero inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has stayed in a low regime since ~Period 29\u201343 (most recent 15 weeks: demands 52,30,23,20,42,15,6,10,9,9,15,18,12,31,10 \u2014 well below earlier highs). On-hand=5, in-transit=0 so avoid excess holdings. Promised lead time historically 0 (all concluded arrivals show 0), so keep L=default. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=15) to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and reduce target base-stock and safety stock, lowering holding cost while preserving service for current demand pattern.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep promised/default lead time. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since mid-2019; recent weeks (Periods 39-44: demands 15,18,12,31,10,6) are much lower than early-year levels. To reflect the recently lower demand and reduce holding cost risk, I use a recent_N forecast based on the most recent observations (short window) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a smaller base stock and tighter cap. No new long-term changepoint to record.
