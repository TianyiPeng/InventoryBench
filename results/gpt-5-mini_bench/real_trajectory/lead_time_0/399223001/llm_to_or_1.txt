Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 399223001 has zero on-hand and zero in-transit. Only five historical weekly samples available (late Jan\u2013early Feb 2019) showing stable weekly demand (233\u2013298). Promised lead time is 0 and no concluded arrivals exist to infer longer actual lead time. To avoid overfitting to a tiny sample and because no evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change exists, use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimators so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service (use of full-sample mean) against holding cost conservatively given holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand samples (5 weeks) show mean ~260.6 units/week and std ~25.5. Period 1 conclude shows order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=308, lead_time=0) confirming same-period lead time. On-hand=10, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus maintain service. I use L=default (promised 0, confirmed by history), mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean of all samples for a stable forecast, and sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. These settings keep the OR engine's base-stock tied to historical weekly demand and a confirmed zero lead time, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) without overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order placed P1 arrived P1, arrived=308).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concludes show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1,P2 arrived same period). On-hand=44, in-transit=0; historical weekly mean \u2248260 (samples 2019-01). Given confirmed 0 lead time and no evidence of demand regime shift, use observed lead-time average and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) so the OR engine balances service level (uses profit/holding to set z) against holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent concluded history shows three consecutive same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 observed for orders placed in Periods 1-3) and on-hand=114, in-transit=0. Demand samples (weekly historical) show mean \u2248 260-280 range; given confirmed L=0, use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time, and default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L)=1. This keeps forecast anchored to full historical mean/variance while respecting confirmed zero lead time and balancing high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $3223.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=140, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a clear downward shift over the last 4 periods (298,272,199,177 \u2192 recent mean 236.5 vs longer-run mean ~261). Lead times have been consistently observed as 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P4 arrived same period). To target service while avoiding excess holding cost, set L to the observed average (calculate). Base-stock inputs use the most recent 4 demand observations to capture the recent lower-demand regime: mu_hat recent_N N=4 and sigma_hat recent_N N=4 so the OR engine reduces ordering to match the decline and limits holding cost while preserving profit-driven service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3428.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has declined from Feb to Mar (last 5 demands: 298,272,199,177,188) and the most recent 3-week mean (~188) is materially below the long-run mean, so I bias the forecast to the recent regime. On-hand=144, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so set L using observed data. Choose recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk while maintaining service; choose calculate for L to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent weekly demand has averaged high (periods show demands 298,272,199,177,188,201), on-hand=6, in-transit=0 so risk of stockout this period. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods (orders placed in P1\u2013P6 arrived same period). I set L to 'calculate' so the backend uses the average observed lead time (confirming 0). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively; with L=0 this targets one-period demand and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead time = 0 across multiple periods) and demand ranging ~177\u2013343 with no sustained new regime (single high week at P7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need orders to cover (1+L) periods. Use default lead time to trust promised 0 (supported by multiple concluded arrivals). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set\u2014this pools historical and recent weeks, avoids overreacting to one high week, and balances service level vs holding cost given low holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand history shows weekly variability (recent demands: 298,272,199,177,188,201,343,237) with current on-hand=97 and in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period). To keep decisions aligned with observed zero lead time and the OR engine's defaults, I use a lead-time estimate based on observed lead times and default demand/volatility calculations so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (covering current-week demand since L=0) against holding cost given moderate on-hand inventory and observed demand variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=217, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand has softened relative to Jan samples; last 5 demands = [201,343,237,159,112], mean=210.4. Lead time was confirmed as 0 previously and recent arrivals have been same-period, so use promised lead time. Use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the current regime and reduce overweighting earlier higher-Jan means. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward current lower demand while preserving service via the OR backend safety-stock calculation.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders placed arrive same period). On-hand=177, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand averages ~200 (no sustained regime shift). Use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand moments so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps policy aligned with observed 0 lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given stable demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=124, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly through Period 12), so actual lead time remains 0. No evidence of a demand regime shift: recent demand samples (Periods 1\u201312) fluctuate but show no sustained >3-period change. Use L=calculate to lock in observed lead time=0; use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given stable demand and confirmed zero lead time. This keeps orders sized to cover current plus next-period demand without extra manual tuning.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=176, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P13) consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0; no missing shipments. Profit $19 vs holding $1 implies high service target. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0 from concluded history, and use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging full historical demand). This balances higher service level (due to high profit) with holding cost via the backend's z* computation.

Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201316) shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly) and stable weekly demand around historical average. On-hand=195, in-transit=0; with confirmed L=0 we can rely on same-period replenishment. Use explicit L=0 to lock in observed lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the sample history, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) without overfitting recent noise. This keeps orders sized by the backend base-stock formula while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock given reliable zero lead time.

Recent demand has been moderate (weekly demands in history range ~100\u2013343, latest weeks ~102\u2013205). Given stable, zero lead time and no evidence of a demand regime shift, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This keeps policy aligned with long-run demand estimates, balancing service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost (no artificial inflation of safety stock).

On-hand=229, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for upcoming demand. I select L=default to use promised lead time (0) since multiple concluded arrivals confirm it. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given confirmed LT=0 and moderate demand variability.

Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Demand history shows stable weekly demand with concluded arrivals each period and confirmed actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period). Current on-hand=266, in-transit=0 so no overdue shipments. Use default lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period reality and let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history. This balances service (use full-sample mean to cover typical demand) against holding cost given high starting on-hand and low holding cost ($1/unit). No explicit inflation or recent-regime detected, so defaults avoid overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent weekly demand has declined from spring peaks; last 10 concluded demands (P12-P21) average ~137/week with lower variance and recent values 48\u2013229 (most recent six 102,109,85,48,111,205 start but ending on-hand high). On-hand=205, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Promised lead time previously confirmed as 0 (Period 2). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime while keeping safety stock for service (profit=19 vs hold=1 \u2192 high service quantile), I use L=default (promised 0), mu_hat recent_N with N=10 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent regime, and sigma_hat recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce overweighting of older high-demand weeks and let the OR engine compute a high service z* (q\u22480.95) while avoiding excess long-term holding given current on-hand=205.

I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) to compute a base-stock that balances the $19/unit profit against $1/unit holding cost. This keeps orders responsive to observed demand while avoiding excess inventory given low holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and moderately stable weekly demand with no sustained spike. On-hand=247, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Given confirmed LT=0 and stable demand, use default lead time so backend trusts promised LT. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history\u2014this balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) by letting the backend set the base-stock target via its critical fractile and capped order rule.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across many periods (orders placed each period arrived same period). Current on-hand=194, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand has averaged well below 194 so on-hand is adequate but we let OR compute target using full-sample stats. Therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand dispersion; use default mu_hat/sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, leveraging the confirmed 0-period lead time and full historical data.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=121, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period). Demand has declined from spring peaks into summer (recent concluded demands lower than early-year peaks). I choose default lead time to trust promised 0. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level given profit=19 vs holding=1 while avoiding manual bias from short-term noise. This keeps orders sized by long-run demand estimates and the capped policy will limit order sizes to sensible values given observed variability.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has risen in July\u2013Aug (last 4 weeks: 60,112,182,193) versus earlier summer lows; on-hand=108, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 historically, so use default promised lead time. To react to recent demand uptick while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (captures latest regime). This raises the backend target inventory toward recent demand levels and increases safety stock for higher observed volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=28, in-transit=0 so available supply is low entering demand after decision; recent weeks show rising demand (last 5 demands: 60,112,182,193,200) indicating a short-term demand upshift. No overdue arrivals visible in concluded history; lead time has been consistently 0. To react to the recent uptick while limiting holding cost, I use L=default (promised/observed 0), and set demand estimates from the most recent 5 weeks to capture the new regime: mu_hat recent_N N=5 and sigma_hat recent_N N=5. This biases orders toward current higher demand while keeping variability measured from the same window so the OR backend balances service level (via higher base stock) against holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent weekly demand has been elevated and variable (last 5 demands: 112, 182, 193, 200, 137; mean \u2248165) while on-hand=113 and in-transit=0. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use the promised 0 lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (captures recent elevation vs. older winter samples). I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility and ensure the OR base-stock and cap calculations account for higher recent variability, balancing service level (profit per unit $19) against low holding cost ($1/unit).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many periods with arrived=ordered and explicit 'lead_time was 0 periods'). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2014 no pipeline. Demand history shows stable weekly sales with no recent sustained regime shift. I select L=default to use the promised lead time (0) which is confirmed by concluded messages. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all historical samples; this leverages full sample set to balance service (profit per unit high versus low holding cost) and avoids overfitting to short fluctuations when no clear changepoint is present. This also ensures orders will be sized to cover current period demand plus the lead-time horizon.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has jumped sharply in early Sept: Periods 30-32 demand = 225, 328, 356. Historical baseline (Periods 1-29) mean \u2248165; recent 3-period mean \u2248303 (+~84%). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use default L. Because a sustained high-demand regime is observed (3 consecutive high weeks), use recent_N on the most recent 3 samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated mean and volatility and to prompt higher ordering that balances service level vs low holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 30: avg demand increased from ~165 (Periods 1-29) to ~303 (Periods 30-32), +84%

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent weeks (Periods 30-33) show a sustained higher-demand regime (~303 avg) vs earlier ~165; on-hand=16, in-transit=0 so little buffer. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm 0, so use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 30-33) to capture the new regime; sigma_hat also use recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the post-change demand while keeping variance estimate tied to the short recent window, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given low on-hand) against holding cost.

No in-transit inventory and on-hand=167. Lead time historically confirmed 0 periods. To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (the 5-period regime since Period 30). This biases the backend forecast to the higher recent mean/volatility while keeping promised lead time (0) so orders arrive same period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14): recent demand regime (Periods 30-35) is elevated vs earlier history (mean \u2248309 vs \u2248165 prior). On-hand=168, in-transit=0 so no incoming cover; choose L=default to use promised lead time (historically confirmed 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast over the elevated regime (covers demands from Periods 30-35: 225,328,356,401,284,262). This keeps target base stock aligned to the new higher mean while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; minimizes stockouts from under-forecasting while avoiding excessive holding cost by not using full-history mean.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). Recent demand regime (Period 30 onward) shows sustained higher demand (~+84% vs Periods 1-29). Current on-hand=94, in-transit=0, so pipeline is empty and risk of stockouts is real if ordering uses older low-demand average. L set to default (promised=0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0 lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 30-36 = 7 weeks); this keeps the backend forecast focused on the elevated mean and recent volatility so the base-stock raises service level while limiting extra holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals). Demand regime increased starting Period 30 (higher weekly demand ~300+ vs ~165 earlier). I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (all zero). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (regime from Periods 30\u201337, length=8) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and volatility; this keeps base stock sized for the new higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand data.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=127, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (Period 1..38). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 30 (avg ~303 vs ~165 before) and persisted through Periods 30-38. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised=0) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the recent regime length (Periods 30-38, N=9). This biases the OR base-stock toward the higher recent mean while measuring recent volatility for service-level sizing, balancing profit-driven service with holding cost given current inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand regime increased starting Period 30 (higher weekly sales ~303 vs ~165 previously). Current on-hand=161, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments visible. I set L=default (promised 0; historical concludes consistently show 0 lead time). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the elevated demand regime (Periods 30-39) so the (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the new higher mean. For sigma_hat I use default to provide a stable volatility estimate from full history. These choices raise the target base-stock to match the sustained higher demand while keeping sigma from a small-sample overreaction, balancing service level (high profit-driven fill rate q=0.95) against holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (avg demand rose ~+84% vs Periods 1-29). On-hand=235, in-transit=0. No evidence of lost shipments; observed lead time has been consistently 0. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N over the post-changepoint window to compute demand across the (1+L) review+lead period and the corresponding volatility. This keeps the base-stock tuned to the elevated demand while L=default keeps reliance on the promised (and historically confirmed) same-period lead time.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=159, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand increased from ~165 (P1-29) to ~303 starting P30; use recent regime to forecast. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=12 (periods 30-41) to capture the higher post-changepoint mean; same N for volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods, balancing service level (profit $19) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time 0 (many periods P1\u2013P42). Demand regime increased starting Period 30 (Periods 30\u201332 avg ~303 vs ~165 earlier) and has remained elevated through Period 42. To match the elevated demand, set lead time to promised (default) since observed LT=0 is stable. Use recent_N for demand estimates to focus on the post-change regime: choose N=13 (Periods 30\u201342 inclusive) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean/volatility and avoid overstock from older low-demand periods. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost by sizing base stock from recent demand behavior.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (multiple confirms including Period 2), and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (recent average ~303 vs ~165 earlier). I set L to default (promised 0) because observed lead time is reliably 0. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean: regime length from Period 30\u201344 = 15, so mu_hat recent_N N=15. Volatility should reflect recent variability, so sigma_hat recent_N N=15. These choices bias the base-stock to satisfy the higher recent demand while keeping lead time consistent with observations, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (higher mean ~303 persists through Period 45). With no pipeline, I must size parameters to the new high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 30\u201345, 16 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained higher mean/variance.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=223, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1 arrival P1 and many subsequent 0-period arrivals). Demand regime shift detected starting Period 30 (Periods 1-29 mean ~165, Periods 30-32 ~303, sustained higher demand thereafter). I set L=default to trust promised/observed 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean/variance: regime length = 17 periods (P30\u2013P46) \u2192 N=17. This gives mu_hat tied to the most relevant higher-demand window so base-stock meets elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures the increased volatility; combined these parameters balance service level (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost given sizable on-hand inventory and no pipeline.
