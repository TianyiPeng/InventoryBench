Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent historical weekly demand (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) averages 161 units/week (samples: 172,178,181,109,165). On-hand and in-transit are zero; no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time changes. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples\u2014this balances service level using full-sample statistics without overreacting to limited data or a single low week.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows the P1 order arrived with observed lead_time=0 (ordered and arrived same period). Historical weekly demand samples mean=161. I set L via "calculate" (average of observed lead times = 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. I choose mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (leveraging full history: mean\u2248161). This provides a baseline replenishment to meet expected demand while the relatively high profit ($19) versus holding cost ($1) favors service; using full-sample stats avoids overreacting to a single period swing and handles potential lost-shipment signals if future concludes differ.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two arrivals with observed lead_time=0 (Period1 and Period2), on-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (Jan-Feb) show mean demand ~161; recent sold values (143,194) are within historical variability, no sustained regime change (only 2 recent weeks). I keep L at promised (default) since observed lead_time=0 twice. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to center forecast on the five available historical samples while keeping responsiveness to current level. I keep sigma_hat default (uses all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to let the OR backend size safety stock from historical volatility. These choices balance service (cover next period demand with L=0) against holding cost given current low on-hand (10) and no in-transit units.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2914.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals P1-P3 show orders arrived with lead_time=0 (three samples), so actual lead time = 0. Recent demand (concluded) over P1-P3 = [143,194,156], avg \u2248164.3; earlier historical weekly samples (172,178,181,109,165) are consistent. I set L using observed average lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period service. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to prioritize the most recent demand regime (captures recent spike in P2), giving the OR engine a focused forecast and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead period to balance service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2692.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Observed arrivals in Periods 1-4 all arrived same period (lead_time=0 confirmed). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-4) = [143,194,156,145], recent mean = 159.5. On-hand=63, in-transit=0. I keep L as default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the current regime mean (159.5) and avoid diluting with older Jan samples. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices give the OR backend an updated short-run forecast and uncertainty while respecting the confirmed 0-period lead time, balancing service level (use of recent mean) against holding cost (no artificially inflated lead coverage).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2141.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=82, in-transit=0. All concluded periods (P1\u2013P5) show orders arriving same period (observed lead_time=0 consistently). Demand history available (samples) shows mean \u2248161 units/week. Given consistent evidence of 0 actual lead time and no sustained demand regime shift (recent sold quantities vary but not yet a sustained change of 3+ periods), use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set. This balances service (target fill driven by profit/holding tradeoff) against holding cost while avoiding overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2158.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P6) show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and on-hand=84, in-transit=0. Profit $19 vs holding $1 implies a very high service quantile (q=0.95), so I keep promised lead time (0) and estimate demand using the most recent 6 observed weekly demands (P1\u2013P6) to capture current regime (143,194,156,145,117,118). I supply mu_hat and sigma_hat as recent_N (N=6) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from these recent samples, which balances high service level with current downward drift in demand and avoids overreacting to older samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1907.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 for all prior orders (Periods 1\u20137). Recent demand history shows steady weekly demand (~105\u2013194) with no sustained regime shift. No overdue/lost shipments observed. I therefore keep L at default (promised 0), and use default demand/volatility computations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this balances service level given stable demand and avoids unnecessary inventory holding.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 4-8) = [145,117,118,105,203] shows typical weekly demand ~110\u2013145 with a single large spike (203) in Period 8; no sustained regime shift (only one high week). All concluded orders historically arrived with lead_time=0. I keep L as default (promised lead time=0). To balance service vs holding cost I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to be responsive to the most recent demand profile while avoiding overreaction to a single spike. This yields a demand forecast reflecting the last 5 weeks and a matching volatility estimate; no new carry-over insight recorded.

Demand history shows no sustained regime shift (recent weeks vary but return to historical range), so use default demand and volatility calculations to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. These settings balance service level (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) using backend's z* formula while avoiding overfitting to recent noise.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201310) shows all observed lead_times = 0 periods. Demand over concluded periods ranges roughly 82\u2013203 with no sustained regime shift. On-hand=123, in-transit=0 so current inventory covers ~1\u20131.5 weeks of recent demand. I set L via calculate (avg observed lead time = 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L); this balances service (uses historical mean) against holding cost given current adequate on-hand and no evidence of increased volatility or seasonality. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments or seasonality are warranted.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=110, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders placed each period arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 7-11 = 105, 203, 135, 82, 96) reflects current regime with mean ~124.2; I use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent demand level and variability. Keeping L=default (promised lead time 0) is supported by consistent same-period arrivals. These parameters aim to set base-stock around current short-term mean while limiting holding cost given modest holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent weekly demand has averaged ~127 units (last 5 periods: 203,135,82,96,121) with no evidence of changed lead time (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Use L=default (promised 0) since observed lead times are consistently 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent regime (captures the post-Apr spike and subsequent demand). These parameters give the OR engine a short-horizon demand estimate and recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost given current inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=101, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show orders consistently arriving same period (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period). Recent demand (Periods 1-13) averages around ~130/week with moderate variability. No overdue shipments. To keep policy simple and leverage full history, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level given confirmed L=0 and avoids overreacting to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand history through Period 14 shows stable weekly demand without a sustained regime shift. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this trusts full historical data and lets the backend balance profit vs. holding cost given observed stability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent realized weekly demand has averaged ~103 units over the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 11-15: 96,121,104,113,81) with no evidence of delayed or lost shipments (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). On-hand=117, in-transit=0 \u2014 stock is sufficient for ~1 week at recent demand. I set L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (historical concludes consistently show 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime (stable ~100/week) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices give the OR engine a forecast focused on current demand and avoid overreacting to older samples, balancing high profit-driven service level (q\u22480.95) against holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all arrivals shown as lead_time=0), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand appears lower than earlier weeks (last 5 demands: 121,104,113,81,74 \u2192 mean \u224898.6), so use a recent-N forecast to capture the current lower regime and reduce holding cost. Chosen: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 5 weeks; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target inventory aligned to current demand and limits holding cost given ample on-hand and no in-transit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Recent history (Periods 1\u201317) shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 every concluded period) and stable weekly demand around historical sample mean (samples: 172,178,181,109,165 ; mean=161). On-hand=66, in-transit=0. No evidence of lost shipments or changepoint (demand variability moderate). Profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1) so maintain service focus. Use default lead time and default demand/statistics to let OR backend compute base stock from historical mean and std, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. Recent demand has declined vs earlier history: last 4 demands = [81,74,67,48], earlier series averaged ~140. All concluded lead-time observations show 0 periods. I therefore keep L as default (promised=0). To respond to the recent lower demand regime while preserving service, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (captures the 4-period low-demand regime). This lowers the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast and reduces safety stock, trading some service risk for lower holding cost given current high on-hand (148) and zero in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting ~Period 15: recent 4-period avg demand = 67.5 vs historical avg ~141 (\u2248 -52%).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Recent history shows a sustained drop in demand starting ~Period 15 (recent 4 weeks much lower than earlier samples). On-hand=94, in-transit=0 so current inventory is ample vs recent demand (avg of last 4 weeks). Promised lead time historically observed=0 (all concluded lead_times=0). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service given the lower regime, set L=default (use promised 0). For demand, use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new lower-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=4 chosen because the changepoint regime length \u22484 recent periods). This reduces target base-stock to match the lower recent mean and lowers safety stock reflecting recent variability, balancing profit per unit vs holding cost and avoiding overstock given zero in-transit.

Use promised lead time (default L=0). Set mu_hat to recent_N with N=6 to base forecast on the 6-period low-demand regime (Periods 15-20).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus lead. Recent history shows a sustained downshift in demand beginning ~Period 15 (periods 15-21 lower than historical). Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded periods (orders arriving same period), so use L=default. To reflect the new lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (N=7, Periods 15-21) so the OR engine targets service for the current lower mean while capturing recent variability. This reduces overstock risk versus using long-run averages and aligns orders with observed demand drop.

To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (Periods 15\u201322), use recent_N for demand estimates with N=8 (regime length ~8 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a lower base-stock and tighter cap, reducing holding cost while preserving service.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has shifted lower starting ~Period 15 (user-provided evidence). On-hand=74, in-transit=0 \u2014 no incoming arrivals visible. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead_time=0, so keep promised lead time. To target current low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility to focus the OR forecast on the post-change data (capture reduced mean/variance). Chosen N=10 to cover the regime since ~Period15 (periods 15\u201324 \u2248 10 samples). This reduces target base stock and caps orders to limit holding cost while preserving service given lower demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has fallen sharply vs earlier history: last 11 demands (P15\u2013P25) avg \u2248 67.5 vs historical avg \u2248141 (\u2248 -52%). On-hand=44, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so keep L=default. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (changepoint ~P15) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (regime length P15\u2013P25 = 11 periods) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the new regime, reducing target base-stock and holding costs while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show zero actual lead time (orders arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 15 (user supplied insight); to reflect the post-change demand profile I use recent samples rather than all-time averages. I choose recent_N with N=12 (periods 15\u201326 inclusive) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime while smoothing week-to-week noise. Using recent demand for both mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service level and holding cost given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19). No evidence of lost shipments or new lead-time shift in concluded data, so L remains default behaviorally but mu/sigma use recent data to reduce overstocking.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained downward demand regime beginning \u2248Period 15 (user carry-over notes ~ -52%). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must forecast demand to cover this and next period. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so keep L=default (promised=0). To reflect the confirmed lower-demand regime while smoothing noise, I use recent_N with N=13 (length since changepoint \u224813 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std over the most relevant regime. This balances service (avoiding stockouts in the new lower regime) and holding cost (avoiding rebuild to pre-shift stock levels).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since ~Period 15 (recent 4-period avg = 67.5 vs historical ~141). On-hand=42, in-transit=0 and no evidence of lost shipments; observed lead times have been 0 historically. To capture the recent lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 samples (focused on the new regime) while keeping L at the promised/default (0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. This reduces forecasted order quantities to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given the sustained demand drop.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift beginning ~Period 15 (recent demand substantially lower than long-run). Promised lead time has been reliably 0 in concluded history, so use default L. To reflect the recent lower demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (captures the most recent 4-week demand pattern) so the OR engine reduces target base-stock and volatility, lowering overstock risk while keeping service. This addresses missing pipeline (none) and prioritizes holding-cost reduction given low recent demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 so use promised lead time. Recent demand has been volatile (last 5 demands: 90,107,67,66,141) and shows a higher short-run mean than the low-regime documented earlier; to react to the most recent regime while limiting carry, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 samples (N=5). These choices let the OR engine size the base-stock to recent demand while reflecting recent variability to balance service (profit) vs holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show persistent lead_time=0 (no delayed/lost shipments). Demand showed a lower regime around Periods ~15-19, but the last 5 weeks (Periods 27-31 demands: 102,109,76,63,146 with recent spikes 141 and 181 in P30-31) are volatile with a recent uptick. To balance service level against holding cost, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 weeks to capture current regime/volatility. Thus: L=default; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)-period demand using recent mean; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability.

Recent demand (Periods 25-32) shows a sustained uptick vs the mid-year lull (recent 8-period avg \u2248111 units/week vs earlier depressed weeks). To respond to the recent demand regime while avoiding excess holding, keep L at promised (0) and use recent_N=8 to forecast mean and volatility so the OR engine targets inventory to the current higher-demand regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a clear uptick from Period 30\u201333 (demands 141,181,180,451; 4-period avg=238.25) versus the prior low-regime (recent 4-period avg=67.5 reported earlier). All concluded lead-time observations have been 0 historically. To capture the new high-demand regime while keeping the OR backend aware of current variability, set L=default (promised 0), mu_hat=recent_N (N=4) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 4 samples, and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=4) to reflect elevated volatility from the last 4 samples. This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts observed in Period 33 while accepting modest additional holding cost given profit/holding ($19/$1) profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Periods 30\u201333 avg demand = 238.25 vs prior recent 4-period avg = 67.5 (\u2248 +253%), indicating a new high-demand regime starting ~Period 30.

To reflect the new higher mean and short history of the regime, keep lead time at promised/default (observed LT=0 historically) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets a higher base stock consistent with the last 5 weeks. This balances service (capture high current demand) vs holding cost given ample on-hand but no pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent sustained demand regime shift starting ~Period 30 (higher demand: Periods 30\u201335). On-hand=272, in-transit=0; ample on-hand but demand remains elevated so forecast should reflect new regime. Set L=default (promised lead time=0, historically observed 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the new high-demand regime (use last 6 periods: Periods 30\u201335) to capture elevated mean and volatility and avoid understocking while holding cost is low relative to profit.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=230, in-transit=0. All observed conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 historically, so keep L as default (promised 0). Demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201336 avg demand = 226.43 vs prior avg \u2248141). To capture the new regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (periods 30\u201336) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the elevated recent regime. This keeps service high while avoiding unnecessary inventory from older low-demand data.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=151, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Demand shifted up beginning ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201333 avg=238.25 vs prior avg \u224867.5) and high demand has persisted through Period 37 (Periods 30\u201337 length=8). I set L=default (use promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to anchor forecast and volatility to the new high-demand regime (captures last 8 weeks since the changepoint) so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet elevated demand while controlling holding cost given current strong demand evidence.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since ~Period 30 (multiple large demands and large replenishments); on-hand=120, in-transit=0. Promised lead time has been observed as 0 in all concluded periods, so keep L=default. To capture the new high-demand regime, set demand estimates using the most recent regime samples (Periods 30\u201338, N=9). This ensures mu_hat reflects current elevated demand and sigma_hat captures recent volatility, letting the OR backend raise the base stock to protect service while holding cost ($1) is low relative to profit ($19).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand jumped starting ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201339 show a sustained high-demand regime). On-hand=220, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historical concluded lead times = 0. To capture the new high-demand regime I set L=default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=10 to base forecast on Periods 30\u201339 (regime length \u224810) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the higher demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in mind given substantial on-hand inventory.

Historical data shows a sustained high-demand regime starting ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201340 show elevated demand vs earlier low regime). Use promised lead time (default) since all concluded lead-times = 0. To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the confirmed post-changepoint regime (Periods 30\u201340, regime length 11). Match sigma_hat to the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This raises target base-stock for service while keeping holding cost considered by OR backend.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Demand has been in the high regime since ~Period 30 (Periods 34\u201341 avg \u2248 203 units/week); recent 8-week avg (Periods 34\u201341) = 202.75, recent 4-week avg (Periods 38\u201341) = 185. On-hand=194, in-transit=0 \u2014 on-hand roughly matches one week of recent demand but no pipeline. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods, so use default promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (covers Periods 34\u201341). This supplies the OR engine with an (1+L)-period demand forecast reflecting the new regime and a volatility estimate based on the same window, helping balance service (reduce stockouts in this higher-demand regime) against holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). History shows lead time consistently observed as 0 in concluded messages. Demand shifted up starting ~Period 30 (Periods 30\u201333 onward higher demand regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must size (1+L)-period demand to cover current-period demand after decision. I set L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded lead times are consistently 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime from Period 30 through Period 42 (regime length ~13 periods) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the recent high-demand samples, balancing service vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

No evidence of delayed or lost shipments (concluded lead times = 0 consistently). To capture the post-Period-30 demand regime, set lead time to default (promised=0) and use recent_N for demand estimates over the regime length to bias the OR base-stock toward higher demand while keeping volatility estimated from the same window.

LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-23 Period=46. On-hand=305, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods, so keep L=default (promised=0). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since ~Period 30 (carry-over noted); recent weeks include large spike (Period 42) and elevated weekly demand since. To capture the recent high-demand regime while smoothing single-week spikes, I use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the last 8 demand observations to reflect the new regime and updated volatility). This raises the backend base-stock to favor service (profit/holding implies high service target) while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability and prevents under-ordering.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

With high on-hand and no pipeline, we should rely on the post-Period-30 regime for forecasting but avoid aggressive ordering now. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 to capture the sustained high-demand regime from Period 30\u201346 (regime length 17) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher mean and volatility; this prevents the backend from under-forecasting the new regime while the large on-hand stock will keep immediate orders low.
