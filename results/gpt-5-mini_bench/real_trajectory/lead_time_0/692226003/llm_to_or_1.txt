Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Historical weekly samples (5): mean=114.2, no recent changepoint or seasonality evidence. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples to let OR backend compute base-stock balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent arrival: Period1 order=169 arrived in Period1 (lead_time=0). On-hand=31, in-transit=0; last period demand=138. Promised lead time=0 and observed lead time=0, so set L by calculate to use observed lead times. Demand history (90,75,152,112,142) shows mean ~114.2; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This keeps target base-stock aligned with historical weekly demand while accounting for low holding cost vs profit to maintain service level.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period1, ordered P1 arrived P1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demands: P1=138, P2=180 (rising vs Jan samples). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus buffer. Lead-time observed twice as 0 (orders placed P1,P2 arrived same period), so set L using observed average. To capture the recent upward demand while still incorporating older weekly samples, use an EWMA demand forecast (gamma=0.5) for mu_hat; keep sigma_hat as default to reflect historical volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances higher service (responding to recent spike) against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3382.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent demand has risen: Periods 1-3 demands = 138, 180, 180. On-hand=38, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded periods. To capture the recent regime increase, set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 demand samples (captures the higher mean and volatility). This biases the base-stock toward higher service for the sustained demand uptick while keeping holding costs controlled by using recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1-3: recent avg demand = 166 vs historical avg \u2248114.2 (+45%).

Daily Profit: $3857.00, Daily Holding Cost: $3.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $3854.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period) and a demand uplift in the most recent 3 periods (Periods 1-3 of history used in regime note). On-hand=3, in-transit=0 so no pending arrivals; no overdue/lost shipments. To reflect confirmed lead time use L by calculating observed lead times. To capture the recent demand regime shift I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the elevated recent mean/variance and avoid being diluted by older lower-demand samples. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher service (higher base stock) to reduce missed sales given low holding cost relative to profit (profit $19, holding $1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2530.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weeks show higher demand vs historical (recent 3-4wk avg \u2248170\u2013175 vs historical mean 114.2). On-hand=73, in-transit=0 so coverage is limited if elevated demand persists. Lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded periods; use calculated average to confirm. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher regime and avoid understocking; apply same recent window for sigma to reflect increased volatility. These choices bias orders upward to protect service level while the OR backend will cap orders using its cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3119.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P6 all arrived same period). Recent demand has been elevated versus older historical samples (recent periods P2\u2013P6 avg demand higher), so I bias forecasting to recent demand. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 0). I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent higher-demand regime (last 5 concluded demand samples P2\u2013P6). This increases target base-stock to improve service while keeping holding risk visible to the OR engine.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=74, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Recent demand (Periods 1-7) shows a sustained higher regime vs historical sample: recent mean \u2248163.6 units/week vs historical mean \u2248114.2 (+~43%). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I set L=default to use promised (and confirmed) lead time=0. I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to capture the sustained elevated demand regime (1+L times mean of last 7 observed demands \u2248163.6). I also use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility rather than older lower-variance history. These choices bias orders upward to meet the higher demand while keeping holding cost modest (L=0 keeps review period short).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent realized weekly demand is well above historical Jan samples (recent 8-period demand shows sustained higher levels including P8=215). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current period demand plus safety. Actual observed lead times in concludes have been 0 consistently, so use calculated lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 demand samples (captures the detected higher-demand regime and recent volatility) so the OR backend sizes base-stock and cap to meet elevated demand while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=89, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been volatile with spikes (203,215) and troughs (131); profit $19 vs holding $1 implies high service level target. Use L=default (promised LT=0, historically confirmed). Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime while smoothing older noise. Use sigma_hat=default to let backend scale variability by sqrt(1+L). These settings prioritize service (higher target inventory) given high profit and low holding cost while respecting observed recent demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1-P10 arrived same period). Recent demand has lifted vs historical winter baseline; last 5 concluded demands (P6-P10) = [167,140,215,131,155], mean \u2248161.6, std \u224828.9. On-hand = 69, in-transit = 0. I choose L=calculate to confirm observed lead time=0; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the higher recent regime (uses (1+L)*mean of last 5); sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given stronger recent demand while sigma_hat supports a reasonable safety-stock buffer; holding cost is low relative to profit so higher service is justified.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (orders in P1\u2013P11 all arrived same period). Recent demand has been above long-run mean; last 5 demands (P7\u2013P11)=140,215,131,155,154 (avg\u2248159). To reflect observed zero lead time I set L=calculate (average observed lead times=0). To capture the recent higher demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the last 5 weeks' mean/volatility, balancing service level for elevated demand against holding cost. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead time=0 consistently; use calculated average lead time. Recent demand (Periods 8-12 = 215,131,155,154,186) averages ~168, materially above historical ~114 \u2192 use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the higher regime. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock aligned to the new higher-demand regime while L=0 avoids inflating pipeline when arrivals have been same-period.

All concluded arrivals show lead time=0. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the elevated recent demand and captures recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed) and elevated weekly demand vs the small 2019-Jan sample. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must rely on forecast. I set L to default (use promised lead time=0) because multiple concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR engine uses the full-sample (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std; this balances service level (using profit/holding tradeoff inside OR) while avoiding overfitting to recent spikes given limited evidence for a new sustained regime beyond prior carry-over insights.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical demand (Periods 1-15) avg \u2248173.7 units/week, indicating a sustained higher-demand regime vs original early-sample mean. No evidence of lost shipments; lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (use promised lead time=0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=15 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the full up-to-date sample reflecting the sustained higher demand. Sigma_hat set to default to let backend compute volatility from all samples (scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service level (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given elevated demand) against holding cost by keeping L=0 and using backend cap.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand remains elevated vs early-sample mean; last 5 demands (Periods 12-16) = [186,189,257,174,151], recent mean=191.4. On-hand=93, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to target the current higher-demand regime and reduce stockouts, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine toward a higher base-stock appropriate for sustained elevated demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Demand has variability but no new sustained regime shift since prior carry-overs (recent spikes are not persistent). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (which are 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given stable lead time and no new sustained demand change.

Demand has varied (earlier spike noted), but recent weeks (Periods 17-20) show moderate demand ~90-117. I keep L at promised (default=0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has fallen vs mid-season peaks; last 8 weekly demands (P17-24) average ~84.6 units/week. On-hand=173, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory covers ~2 weeks at recent demand. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0; no evidence of lost shipments. I set L=default to trust promised 0. I use recent_N N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility to the latest lower-demand regime (captures recent decline vs earlier high weeks) so OR reduces orders and holding cost while keeping reasonable service given current on-hand stock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. On-hand=130, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected this period. Recent demand has fallen substantially over the last 5 periods (P21-25). Use promised lead time (default L=0) since concluded history repeatedly confirms 0 LT. Reduce demand forecast to recent behavior: set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained drop. Reduce volatility likewise with sigma_hat recent_N (N=5). This lowers target base-stock and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service for current lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand decline starting Period 21: avg demand P21-25 = 65.8 vs prior P16-20 = 108.4 (\u221239%), sustained for 5 periods

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=98, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen since Period 21; last 6 demands (P21-P26) = [90,93,56,47,43,32], avg \u224860.2, clearly below prior regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding while preserving service, I set L to default (promised 0). I forecast demand using the recent 6-period regime (recent_N N=6) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 6 samples), and set sigma_hat from the same recent 6 samples to capture current lower volatility. This reduces target base-stock and cap relative to historical higher-demand regime and addresses the sustained decline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 21 (P21-25 avg 65.8, sustained 5 periods) and recent weekly demands are: P23-27 = [56,47,43,32,47]. On-hand=56, in-transit=0; next period demand occurs after decision so we must cover (1+L) periods. Many conclude messages show lead_time=0 (including recent P27 arrival), so keep promised lead time. To reflect the sustained downward demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock based on the most recent low-demand regime, reducing overstock risk while preserving service. L uses default (promised lead time=0).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed previously arrived same period). Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 21 (P21-28 avg \u2248 57, recent five-week avg \u2248 43). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and current reliable lead time, set L using observed lead times and use recent_N(5) for demand moments so the OR backend targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility, reducing stocking given low on-hand and low incoming pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Recent sustained demand decline since Period 21 (lower avg demand through Period 29). On-hand=37, in-transit=0 so pipeline low; risk of stockouts small given low recent demand but avoid excess inventory. Lead time historically confirmed 0 across many concluded periods, so use promised lead time. For demand I target the recent low regime: use recent_N over the last regime (Periods 21\u201329, regime_length=9) so N=9 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture lower mean and volatility and keep inventory aligned with current demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=86, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen sharply: last 6 demands (P25-30) = [43,32,47,46,17,8], avg \u224832.2 \u2014 a sustained low regime over 6 periods. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To avoid overstock while preserving service, set lead time to the observed average (0) and base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime using the last 6 samples for mean and volatility so the OR engine targets a much lower base stock consistent with current demand and minimizes holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand further decline starting Period 25: avg demand P25-30 = 32.17 vs prior P21-24 \u224872.0 (\u221255%), sustained for 6 periods

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0. On-hand = 78, in-transit = 0; given low recent demand and high on-hand, reduce target inventory. Set L to default (promised 0) since observed lead time confirmed 0. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime and recent variability so the OR engine lowers order quantity and avoids holding cost.

Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 25 (sustained decline to ~32/week and lower through P32). On-hand=66, in-transit=0; current inventory already covers multiple weeks at current low demand, so reduce forecast to recent low regime. Set L to default (promised 0, historically confirmed). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (use demand from P25\u2013P32) to reflect the sustained lower mean and lower volatility, which lowers base-stock and limits new orders to avoid holding cost while preserving service for current low demand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 25; last 6 observed demands (P28-P33) average \u224818 units/week with modest volatility. On-hand=48, in-transit=0 \u2192 current stock covers ~2.6 weeks at recent demand, and holding cost is low relative to profit (profit=$19, holding=$1) so keep modest buffer. Lead time history (concluded arrivals) is consistently 0. I select L=default to use promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (captures the sustained low-demand regime P28\u2013P33). For sigma I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend size a small base-stock tuned to the lowered demand regime, limiting unnecessary purchases while preserving service given high profit margin.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently (orders that arrived show lead_time=0), so use promised lead time. Demand has been in the low post-decline regime since Period 25; recent 10-period average (P26-35 window available samples P26-34) is materially lower than earlier periods, so forecast using recent data to avoid overstock. I set L=default to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (reduces target base-stock and tightens order cadence). This reduces holding costs while preserving service given the low recent demand and high profit-to-cost ratio (q=0.95) which the OR backend will convert to a high z*; using recent data prevents excessive stock accumulation.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Recent demand has been in a low regime: last 5 demands (P31-35) = [8,12,18,10,5], avg \u224810.6. On-hand=46, in-transit=0 so current pipeline is zero; expected near-term demand should be covered but recent mean is very low. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default L. Because a clear changepoint to a much lower demand level began around Period 31, use recent_N=5 for demand forecasting (mu_hat and sigma_hat) to make the base-stock responsive to the new low regime and avoid excess holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has settled at a low regime since Period 31 (demands P31-36 = [8,12,18,10,5,14], recent mean \u224811.17). On-hand=32, in-transit=0 so current coverage \u22483 periods at current demand. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0. I set L via observed average lead time to ensure backend uses the confirmed 0. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (regime length=6 \u2192 N=6). This keeps base-stock low to avoid holding cost while maintaining service for the current low demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (many concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so set L via calculate (avg observed=0). Demand has shifted sharply down since ~Period 31; recent periods (P31-37 demands = [8,12,18,10,5,14,11], mean\u224811.14) define the current regime. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent_N N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect recent low-demand volatility. These selections keep target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime; using observed lead time=0 avoids inflating pipeline coverage.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 31 (recent 5 demands P34-38 = 10,5,14,11,6; mean \u22489.2). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. On-hand=15, in-transit=0. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to preserve confirmed LT=0. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (N=5 chosen because the low regime is sustained and 5 recent samples reflect current mean/volatility). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent low volatility. These parameters prioritize avoiding excessive replenishment given low demand and low holding cost, while maintaining service for the small current demand.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 31 (multiple weeks of single- and low-double-digit demand). Lead times have consistently concluded as 0 in history. To avoid excess holding while preserving service for the low recent demand, I set lead time using observed history and forecast demand/volatility using the most recent 9 weeks (regime length P31\u2013P39 = 9) so the OR engine targets a much lower base-stock that matches current demand.

Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 31 (recent 10 periods P31\u2013P40 show very low weekly sales); to avoid excess holding cost I use a recent-window demand estimate (N=10) for mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the low current regime. This keeps base stock low and reduces holding while preserving service for current demand.

Demand has been in a low regime recent periods (P37-P41 demands = 11,6,8,5,5; recent mean=7). To avoid overstock while meeting low near-term demand, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 so the OR backend sizes base stock to the very low recent demand and captures recent volatility.

Promised lead time=0 and concluded history consistently shows lead_time=0, so keep default lead time. For forecasting, use recent_N on last 12 periods (Period 31\u201342) to capture the sustained low-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean and std; this reduces forecast and prevents overstock while preserving service. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent low volatility.

Demand has been in a low, stable regime since ~P31; recent 5-week demand (P40-44 = 5,5,9,2,3) averages ~4.8. To avoid overstock while meeting a high target service level (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95), I base forecasts on the most recent 5 periods to reflect the sustained low demand. L set to average observed (0); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to capture current low mean and low volatility, keeping orders small and limiting holding cost.
