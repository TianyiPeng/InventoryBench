Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time (promised L=0). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 185.4 units and std \u224857.6. With promised lead time 0, use default methods so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248185.4 and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std \u224857.6. This keeps parameters grounded in recent observed demand while avoiding premature lead-time adjustments given no arrival evidence.

Current on-hand=50, in-transit=0; no evidence of lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, producing a base-stock that balances $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $108.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1 and P2 arrived same period). On-hand=35, in-transit=0; recent sales (136, 143) are below the provided historical sample mean (\u2248185.4). No sustained regime change detected (only two low weeks). I choose L=default (use promised lead time=0). For demand forecasting I use default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to anchor to the longer-run sample mean while observing recent softness. Sigma_hat=default to use sample volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)). These defaults let the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost without overreacting to a short two-week dip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times = 0 for Periods 1-3. Recent demand (Periods 1-3) = [136,143,93], which is ~124 avg vs historical sample mean 185.4 \u2014 a sustained ~33% drop over 3 periods. To be responsive to this confirmed downward regime, set L by calculating observed lead time average (0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the lower recent demand and reduced volatility, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service. This addresses missing pipeline (none) and keeps orders aligned with the new lower demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: avg demand dropped from 185.4 (historical samples) to 124 over Periods 1-3 (-33%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has fallen vs. historical: Periods 1-3 avg = 124 (136,143,93) \u2014 carry-over noted. Period 4 had stockout (sold 124 of 158 actual demand) so true demand likely similar to recent low regime. All observed lead times = 0 (orders arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current low-demand regime. I set L=default (promised 0) because observed lead time history confirms 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to anchor forecasts to the confirmed 3-period low-demand regime, letting the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent low mean) against holding cost by not inflating mean with older, higher-demand samples.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent periods show volatile demand with stockouts in Periods 4-5. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0. To capture recent demand level and volatility I use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and std (uses the last 5 observed weekly demands). This lets the OR backend target a base-stock reflecting the most recent demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive to observed variability. L set to default (promised lead time=0) since concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent periods show repeated stockouts (ending on-hand=0) with strong demand in Periods 4-6 (demand=158,191,152). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no overdue arrivals. Observed lead times have been 0 in all concluded periods. I set L using observed average lead time to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. Because recent demand (Periods 4-6) is lower than the long-run historical mean but represents the most relevant regime given sustained stockouts and recent sales, I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target service for the current demand level and avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Observed concluded lead times have all been 0 so use promised/default lead time. No new sustained changepoint beyond prior recorded insight, so use default demand estimates to let OR backend compute base_stock that balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (earlier baseline mean\u2248185.4) showed a drop to avg=124 over Periods1-3 (already recorded). Recent demands (Periods5-8 = 191,152,211,219) show a sustained higher-demand regime (4 periods). Promised lead time has consistently observed as 0 in concluded messages, so keep L as default. For demand forecast use recent_N over the recent regime: (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 samples to capture current elevated demand (N=4). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters align the base-stock to current higher demand while keeping lead-time assumptions consistent and limiting excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: recent avg demand over Periods5-8 = 193 (191,152,211,219) vs prior regime avg=124 (Periods1-3), increase \u2248+55%, sustained 4 periods

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has risen: Periods 5-8 avg \u2248193 (191,152,211,219) sustained 4 periods; historical samples earlier are lower. On-hand=35, in-transit=0 so current inventory is well below one-period expected demand. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders arriving same period). Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since observed lead times are consistently 0. Set mu_hat to recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (forecast (1+L)*mean of last 4 periods). Set sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet current demand while the OR backend will cap orders per its cap rule.

Use promised lead time (default L=0) so OR backend aligns with observed arrivals.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders from P1\u2013P11 all arrived with lead_time=0). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 5 (Periods 5\u20138 avg \u2248193) though recent 8-period average (Periods 4\u201311) = 166.9. I set L using observed lead times (calculate -> 0). I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent elevated demand regime while smoothing short-term noise. This raises the base-stock to cover current period demand without excessive holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time = 0 each concluded period). On-hand=52, in-transit=0; recent demand (Periods 9-12 = 159,125,120,115) shows no new sustained regime change (not >=3 periods of a new consistent level beyond already recorded shifts). Use default lead time to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals and let OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples so the policy leverages full historical data and the backend's cap logic. This balances service level (profit=holding cost) while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically. Recent demand (Periods 10-13: 125,120,115,82) is materially lower than the prior high regime (Periods 5-9 avg\u2248193). To be conservative vs holding cost, I forecast using the most recent 4 periods to capture the apparent pullback. Thus keep L as promised (default=0) and use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets base-stock to match the lower recent demand and reduced volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen in the last 4 periods (Periods 11-14 demands = 120,115,82,81; recent avg \u2248 99.5) after earlier higher regime. All observed lead times = 0 historically, so keep L as promised (default). To avoid overstock while protecting service given the recent sustained drop, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N of the last 4 samples (captures current low-demand regime). This reduces target base-stock and safety stock versus using older high-demand data, lowering holding cost risk while preserving service.

All observed lead times = 0 historically, so keep promised lead time. To avoid overstock given holding cost equals profit, use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets service to the current lower regime while limiting holding risk.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded lead times = 0 historically. I set L=default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower-demand regime (most relevant for (1+L) review+lead demand and variability) so the OR backend reduces orders versus long-run averages and balances service vs holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Recent demand has dropped and persisted since Period 13 (demands P13-17 = 82,81,79,73,52; avg=73.4 over 5 periods). Use L=default (promised lead time, historically observed 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to target the new low-demand regime (N=5 since recent regime length=5). This keeps orders aligned with current lower demand and avoids excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 13: avg demand over Periods 13-17 = 73.4 (82,81,79,73,52), sustained 5 periods, down \u224840-60% vs earlier regimes.

Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 13 (periods 13-17 avg=73.4) and last 5 demands (P14-P18 = 81,79,73,52,51) average 67.2, sustained 5 periods. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime so the OR engine reduces target base-stock and holding cost exposure while maintaining service for expected demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has settled into the low regime observed from Period 13 onward (demands P13-P19 = 82,81,79,73,52,51,43; recent avg ~66.7). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. All historical conclude messages show lead_time=0, so use promised lead time. To avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5) and the sustained lower demand, set demand forecast using the recent low-demand regime. I choose recent_N with N=7 (uses P13\u2013P19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from the current low-regime mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost. No new lead-time issues detected.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders in Period X arrived in Period X). Recent demand has been in the lower regime identified earlier (Periods 13-17 avg\u224873.4, sustained); latest observed demands (Periods 17-20 = 52,51,43,19) remain low. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms no lead-time drift. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime (use last 5 periods to estimate mean across review+lead period). I apply recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These parameters bias the OR engine toward lower base stock and tighter caps, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the currently lower demand regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical lead times observed all 0; no evidence of delayed/lost shipments. Demand has been in a low regime since Period 13 (avg \u224873) with a further recent decline in the last 9 periods (Periods 13\u201321: demand sequence shows sustained lower demand). To avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding, I bias the forecast to the most recent regime: use recent_N demand estimate over the last 9 periods. Keep lead time at default (promised 0). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings reduce overstock risk while maintaining service for current low-demand regime.

======================================================================

Promised lead time historically observed = 0; use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (N chosen = regime_length=10, within 3\u201320). This focuses the base-stock on the current low-demand level, reducing excess holding given equal profit and holding costs (q=0.5 -> z*=0), while sigma based on the same recent window captures current volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-47.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has fallen sharply and persistently since Period 18; on-hand=49, in-transit=0 so we carry substantial stock vs current low demand. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2014 keep promised lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 18-23, 6 samples) to capture the new low-demand regime and tighten variability estimates; L kept default=promised 0 so orders arrive same period per backend assumptions. This reduces ordering to match lower demand and avoids extra holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand further drop at Period 21: avg demand over Periods 21-23 = 8.7 (15,9,2) vs prior regime avg=73.4 (Periods13-17), sustained 3 periods

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has fallen and been sustained low over Periods 21-24 (15,9,2,2 \u2192 avg \u22487). On-hand=47, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time and all concluded lead times = 0, so keep L default. To reflect the new low-demand regime I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 4 periods (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets much lower base stock and reduces holding cost exposure while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 (demands P21-P25 = 15,9,2,2,4; recent avg \u22486.4 over 5 periods). On-hand=43, in-transit=0 so on-hand comfortably exceeds expected near-term demand but holding cost equals profit so avoid overstock. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0; no evidence of lost shipments. I set L to default (promised=0). To reflect the recent low regime I forecast demand using recent_N over the last 5 periods (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine reduces target base-stock and cap accordingly, lowering order quantities and holding cost risk.

Demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 21 (demands: 15,9,2,2,4,0); I therefore use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bias forecasts to the recent low-demand regime and avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Observed lead times historically = 0 (concluded every period), so keep promised lead time. To avoid excess holding (profit=holding), forecast using the recent low-demand regime: set L=default so backend uses promised 0; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures P21-27) to reflect the sustained drop and reduce order quantities/forecast variance, limiting overstock risk given zero in-transit inventory.

I keep L at promised (default 0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0 historically and no evidence of delayed/lost shipments. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201328) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 8 samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect recent low volatility. This keeps orders small to avoid holding cost while meeting current low demand.

No evidence of delayed/lost shipments; historical concluded lead times = 0. To match the current low regime and avoid excess holding cost, use promised lead time and recent-demand estimates over the last 9 periods. Choices: L=default (promised 0) so orders arrive same period; mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 to scale (1+L)*mean of last 9 samples reflecting the current low demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=9 to capture recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock low to minimize holding cost while covering current demand variability.

Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep L as default (promised 0). Demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 with very low recent weekly sales: Periods 24-30 demands = [2,4,0,5,6,2,5], recent avg \u22483.4. Use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the sustained low regime (regime length=7 \u2192 N=7). This lowers target base-stock and reduces holding cost risk while matching current low demand. Sigma estimated from same recent window to capture current low variability.

Promised lead time historically observed as 0. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (the full recent low-demand regime length) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the most relevant samples. This reduces over-ordering versus longer-horizon/regime data while allowing the capped policy to limit order size, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been in a prolonged low regime since Period 21 (demands mostly 0\u201315, avg ~5\u20139). On-hand=15, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample for one or two weeks at this low demand. Promised lead time historically 0 with no evidence of delays, so use default L to avoid inflating pipeline. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime (changepoint at P21) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (covers Periods 21\u201332) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and reduces ordering to avoid excess holding cost. This balances service level vs holding given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and current inventory.

To avoid excess holding cost given Profit=Holding=$1, keep promised lead time (default L=0). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should reflect the most recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=15 (Periods 21-35) to compute (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std so the OR engine reduces order size and limits holding cost.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (avg ~5/week) \u2014 current on-hand=3, in-transit=0, profit=1, holding=1. Historical concluded lead times all 0; set L by averaging observed lead times. To avoid excess stock vs very low recent demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the current low-demand regime (use N=16, Periods21-36) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to recent demand and lower variability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand is very low and stable (last 5 demands: P33-P37 = 7,2,3,2,3; avg \u22483.4). On-hand=2, in-transit=0 so risk of stockout this period is real but overall regime is low \u2014 use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect current low regime. Actual observed lead times have consistently been 0 in concluded history, so keep default promised lead time. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect confirmed historical 0 lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to target the most recent low-demand regime and keep base_stock aligned with current demand; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given tiny on-hand) against holding cost in a very low-demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent demand has been in the low-single-digits for many periods (Periods 34-38 demands = 2,3,2,3,1). On-hand=3, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical observed lead times are all 0. I therefore use promised lead time (default). To reflect the clear low-demand regime sustained over many periods, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (Periods 34-38) so the OR engine targets a very low base-stock and limits ordering/holding cost exposure.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Current on-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 every observed period \u2192 keep promised lead time. Demand has been in a prolonged low regime since Period 21 (many consecutive periods with single-digit weekly demand); recent regime length \u2248 19 periods (P21\u2013P39). To reflect the sustained low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 19 samples (captures current mean and volatility). L use default (promised = 0). This yields a smaller base stock (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0) aligned to recent demand, limiting overstock while preserving service given very low demand and negligible pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been very low and stable over the last several periods (Periods 36-40 demands = 2,3,1,2,3; recent mean \u22482.2). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical carry-over notes show multiple regime shifts; current regime is the low-demand regime sustained since Period 21 with especially low values in Periods 36-40. I therefore keep promised lead time (L=default) and set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current low regime (mu_hat: recent_N, N=5). I also estimate volatility from the same recent window (sigma_hat: recent_N, N=5). These choices keep base-stock aligned to the very low current demand, minimizing holding cost while preserving service for the small expected weekly demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=3, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals visible. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each arrival \u2014 use promised lead time (default). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 (many consecutive periods with single-digit demand). I therefore forecast using the most recent regime: use recent_N=20 (captures last 20 demands through Period 41) to make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the prolonged low-demand regime. This keeps base_stock small (q=0.5 implies z*=0), avoiding excess holding cost while covering expected (L+1)-period demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 21 with very small recent weekly sales (Periods 36-42 demand = 2,3,1,2,3,0,4). I therefore keep L at promised (default=0). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent 7 concluded periods to capture the current low regime (N=7 covers Periods 36-42). I apply recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility using the current low-demand regime, avoiding excess replenishment and reducing holding cost while preserving service for the small ongoing demand.

Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 21 (sustained: many periods of single-digit demand). On-hand=2, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 \u2014 use promised lead time (default). To reflect the recent low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 39-43: 2,3,0,4,1) so forecasts and safety stock are small and avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service. This keeps base-stock low and caps orders to limit inventory holding given Profit=HoldingCost.

On-hand=1, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Use L=default (promised 0) because observed lead times historically are 0 and no evidence of delays. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and keep orders minimal to avoid holding cost while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding cost given equal profit/holding (q\u22480.5) and the OR engine will compute appropriate safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (multiple periods of very low weekly demand); no evidence of changed seasonality or lead-time shifts in concluded messages. To avoid overstock given Profit=Holding, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand on the recent low-demand regime. I select recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent sustained low-demand regime up to Period 45) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 20 samples, keeping orders conservative and balancing service vs holding cost.

Recent history (Periods 40-46) shows persistently low weekly demand: [3,0,4,1,1,8,7] with the low-demand regime established since Period 13 and sustained. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in all concluded messages. To keep inventory low given profit=holding cost ($1), I use recent_N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime for both mean and volatility so the OR backend sets a low base-stock and avoids excess holding cost.
