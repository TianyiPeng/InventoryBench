Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples: mean\u224831.8, no recent changepoint or seasonality evident). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time shifts or lost shipments. Promised lead time is used (default) because there is no evidence to adjust L. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend computes base-stock consistent with historical average while keeping holding cost exposure low given modest holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Last concluded period shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=42, lead_time observed=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and last period demand was 49 (sold 42 due to stockout). Historical weekly samples (5 weeks Jan\u2013Feb) have mean \u224831.8. I confirm actual lead time = 0 (matches promise) and no sustained demand regime change (single high demand period likely a stockout-driven spike). Therefore use default lead time to let backend assume promised LT=0 and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample statistics) so base-stock targets reflect the full-sample mean/variance while the capped ordering rule will limit excessive orders. This balances service (responding to recent stockout via backend safety factor q) against holding cost given limited evidence of a sustained demand shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demand in conclude messages is elevated (Period1 demand=49, Period2 demand=57) vs earlier historical samples (28,31,39,25,36), on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so stockout risk is high. Both observed lead times were 0 periods (order arrivals matched same period), so use promised lead time. To respond to an apparent upward shift while remaining adaptive, set L=default (promised), forecast demand with an EWMA to weight recent high demands (gamma=0.5), and keep sigma at default to let backend compute volatility from full sample history. This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts while limiting excess holding cost via conservative volatility estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1311.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; last three concluded lead times are 0 (orders arrived same period). Recent realized demand (Periods1-3) = [49,57,84], substantially above historical sample mean (31.8). I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm promised 0. To capture the clear upward demand regime, I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a higher base stock reflecting the last 3 periods' mean and volatility. This addresses the zero inventory/pipeline and reduces stockouts while keeping holding cost awareness via the backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3); Demand regime shift: recent avg (Periods1-3)=63.33 vs historical samples avg=31.80 (+99%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $966.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Concluded history (P1\u2013P4) consistently shows orders arriving same period -> actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has shifted up (Periods1\u20133 avg \u224863.3 vs historical sample mean \u224831.8). To capture the higher recent demand while keeping responsiveness (low promised lead time), set L to calculated average of observed lead times, and forecast demand using the most recent 3 periods to reflect the new regime. Use recent_N=3 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise target base-stock to improve fill rates given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a higher short-run mean and increased variability vs historical baseline; carry-over already confirmed lead time=0. To be responsive while avoiding excess holding cost, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 (most recent 3 demand points) to capture the current regime (Periods 3-5 demand = 84, 53, 28) so the backend sizes base stock to recent demand and observed volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. Recent demand (Periods 4-6 = 53,28,78) shows higher mean and high volatility versus historical pre-sample mean; to capture the current regime I use a recent_N=3 forecast for both demand mean and volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock to protect service while reflecting observed variability.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): on-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times P1\u2013P7 all show 0, so I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0). Recent demand has shifted upward versus the older baseline: last 5 concluded demands (P3\u2013P7 = 84,53,28,78,72) average 63.0, showing a sustained higher-demand regime. To capture this higher mean while reflecting recent volatility, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This raises the base-stock to cover the current higher demand while sigma_hat (recent_N) accounts for elevated variance; with profit=19 and holding=1 the backend will compute an appropriate z and cap to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in past concludes; demand has shifted upward versus historical baseline (carry-over noted: P1-3 avg=63.33 vs hist avg=31.8). Recent demand (Periods 4-8 = 53,28,78,72,81) averages ~62.4, indicating the higher regime persists. Keep L as default (promised 0, confirmed). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the sustained higher recent mean and damp older low samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent variability (higher volatility in recent weeks). These parameters steer the backend toward a higher base-stock to meet the elevated demand while sigma reflects current uncertainty, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods and arrivals are consistent. Recent demand (Periods1-9) is substantially above historical sample mean (regime shift); therefore set L to promised (default) and use recent_N=9 to capture the new higher-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend raises the base stock and accounts for higher volatility while respecting the cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time=0 (orders in P1-P11 arrived same period). Demand has shifted materially above historical sample mean; recent weeks (P4\u2013P11) show sustained higher demand. Therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and set demand forecasts from recent data to capture the higher regime: mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 (periods 4\u201311) so the OR backend sizes base stock for the elevated demand while capping orders to limit holding cost exposure given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand clearly above historical (recent weeks: P8-P12 demands = 81,64,50,78,126). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated recent mean ((81+64+50+78+126)/5=79.8) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. Volatility also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability for safety stock. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given zero inventory and strong recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind via sigma_hat estimation.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=27, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Historical seed mean=31.80. Recent demand has increased materially: last 5 demand samples (Periods 9-13) = [64,50,78,126,100], mean=83.6. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To react to the sustained higher demand while limiting holding cost, set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean \u224883.6 units review+lead demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and ensure safety stock scales to current variability. These choices prioritize service (capture higher demand) while keeping holding cost controlled by using recent data rather than the low historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: recent avg (Periods 9-13)=83.6 vs historical samples avg=31.8 (+163%), sustained over last 5 periods

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent demand has shifted sharply higher and is sustained: last 5 observed demands (Periods 10-14) = [50,78,126,100,152], recent mean = 101.2 vs historical sample mean ~31.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand plus safety. Promised lead time was confirmed as 0 in prior concludes, so use default promised lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher demand regime, and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. These choices push the OR engine to a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while letting the backend cap limit control extreme orders given holding cost tradeoff.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): lead time confirmed as 0 in history; recent demand remains elevated (last 5 demands P11-15 avg \u2248114.8 vs historical sample mean 31.8, sustained). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Given high profit/low holding (q\u22480.95) we target high service using recent demand estimates. Set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (most relevant for (1+L)-period forecast and volatility). This preserves service while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (arrivals same period) and prior carry-over confirms demand regime shift with elevated demand sustained in recent periods. To capture the recent higher demand while keeping safety short (lead time=0), I set L=default (use promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (use the most recent 5 periods reflecting the sustained higher regime, Periods 12-16 demand: 126,100,152,118,132) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 5). Volatility is set to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given confirmed higher demand while sigma_hat from recent data calibrates safety stock to avoid excess holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0. Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 9 (sustained high demand through Period 17). To capture the recent higher mean/volatility, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N on demand to focus the forecast on the recent high-demand regime: select N=9 (Periods 9\u201317) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained uptick and recent variability. This increases the base-stock to reduce stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been persistently higher than historical (last 5 demands avg=117.6 vs hist avg=31.8). On-hand=63, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical concludes confirm lead time=0. Inventory (63) covers ~0.5 of recent weekly demand, so forecast should use the recent high-demand regime. Set L=default to trust confirmed 0 promised lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained elevated mean and volatility from the last 5 weeks (Periods 14-18). This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock reflecting recent variability.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 14 (sustained elevated weekly demand); on-hand=8, in-transit=0, so risk of stockout is material. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised (0) while respecting confirmed arrivals. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 6 periods since changepoint at P14 gives ~6-period regime), which raises the base-stock and safety buffer to balance lost sales (high profit) versus holding cost (low).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand remains in a higher regime vs historical samples (sustained since around Period 9\u201314). On-hand=36, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher demand I use a recent window for demand estimates (last 5 periods) where demand avg \u2248120.4, volatility captured from same 5 periods. This raises base-stock to meet higher demand while keeping holding cost modest (holding $1 vs profit $19).

Historical base samples mean=31.8 but recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime (noted earlier: avg ~83.6 over P9-13 and elevated thereafter). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded history. To capture the sustained higher demand while keeping safety sizing responsive, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to reflect the most recent high-demand regime (N=5 matches the documented sustained run) and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This biases orders upward to avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs reasonable given confirmed short lead time.

Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed 0 (sustained) and a sustained higher-demand regime since ~Period 9; recent 5-period demand (P18-22)=94,152,132,99,79 -> mean=111.2. To keep service in this higher-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding cost, I use promised lead time (default L=0) and set demand forecast using recent 5 periods (mu_hat recent_N N=5) and recent volatility (sigma_hat recent_N N=5) so the OR backend targets a base stock tuned to the elevated recent mean and measured recent variability.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22 (Period 24). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods. Demand exhibits a sustained higher regime since Period 9\u201313 (carry-over) and recent weeks remain elevated: last 5 demands (P19\u2013P23) = [152,132,99,79,66], recent avg = 105.6. On-hand=95, in-transit=0. To reflect the sustained higher mean and recent volatility while keeping lead-time as observed, I set L=default (promised 0), mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to target the current elevated demand (1+L \xd7 recent mean \u2248105.6), and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture recent variability.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=105, in-transit=0. Historical baseline samples mean=31.8 but a sustained higher-demand regime began around Period 14 (carry-over shows recent avg ~83.6 sustained). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To capture the sustained higher demand I use a recent-window demand estimate over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14-24, length=11). Methods chosen: keep promised lead time (default 0) so arrivals remain same-period; set mu_hat using recent_N with N=11 to reflect the higher recent mean demand across (1+L) periods; set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture volatility of the same recent regime. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained elevated demand while using recent volatility to temper overstocking given holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=111, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 14 (sustained elevated demand); to capture the recent regime I use recent_N on the last 13 periods to compute (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility. Using recent_N N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine target service for the sustained higher demand while default L=promised (0) avoids artificially inflating pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=115, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times confirm L=0 (sustained evidence from Periods 1-26). Recent demand (most recent 5 concluded periods: P22\u2013P26 demands = 79,66,60,50,43) averages ~59.6, materially above the long-run sample mean (31.8) and more representative of current selling rates. No overdue or lost shipments visible. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (supported by many concluded 0-LT observations). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher demand regime reflected in the last 5 periods, ensuring the base-stock targets higher service levels and reduce stockouts. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility for the backend safety stock calculation. These choices balance higher profit per unit vs low holding cost by using recent demand to avoid understocking while not inflating long-term variance estimates.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 and a prior sustained high-demand regime (Periods 9-16). Recent realized demand (Periods 23-27 = 66,60,50,43,44) shows a downward shift from the earlier peak; I treat this as a new short-term regime to avoid overstock. Therefore: keep L = default (promised lead time 0, confirmed by history). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 observed demands (captures the recent lower demand). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock versus using the full-sample mean and limits holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=32, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected this period. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals P1\u2013P26). Recent demand has trended down from the spring peak; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 24\u201328) = [60,50,43,44,39], recent mean \u224847.2. To react to this sustained lower recent demand while keeping service, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (captures the latest regime). L uses default (promised 0) since lead time repeatedly confirmed. These parameters reduce overstock risk vs using the higher earlier-season means.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201329 arrivals all same-period). A sustained demand regime shift was observed starting Period 14 (noted in carry-over). To align the OR engine with the higher post-change demand I use recent data since the changepoint: recent_N with N=16 (Periods 14\u201329) to estimate demand mean and volatility. L set to default (promised lead time 0). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the sustained higher-demand regime and limits overstock from older low-demand data while keeping service levels appropriate given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=137, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand has fallen from the earlier high regime (Periods 9-13 avg=83.6) to much lower levels in the last 5 weeks (Periods 26-30 demands = [43,44,39,24,18], avg=33.6). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost given current high on-hand and the clear recent downward shift, I base demand estimates on the most recent 5 weeks and match volatility to that window; keep lead time at default (promised/confirmed 0). These parameters steer the OR backend to cap orders and prioritize reducing ending inventory while still covering immediate demand (review+lead period = 1 period).

Carry-over insight: Recent demand decline: Periods 26-30 avg=33.6 vs prior recent avg (Periods 9-13)=83.6 (\u221260%), sustained over last 5 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16): recent demand has declined and stabilized since Period 26 (Periods26-30 avg=33.6, Period31=6). On-hand=131, in-transit=0 so inventory is ample vs expected near-term demand. Lead time history (many concluded arrivals) confirms 0 periods. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0). To reflect the new lower demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (captures Periods26-31) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std on the recent low-demand regime, reducing ordering and holding cost risk while maintaining service.

On-hand =116, in-transit=0 so current inventory already covers near-term demand; avoid overstock. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised (0). To reflect the recent low-demand regime, I use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, reducing ordering relative to historical highs and lowering holding cost exposure.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has remained low for >5 periods (Periods 32-36 demand = 15,21,11,9,8; recent 5-period avg \u2248 12.8 vs historical avg 31.8 and prior high regime ~83.6). On-hand=67, in-transit=0 so current inventory covers multiple periods of recent demand; no arrivals expected. I set L=default because lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (keeps forecast and safety stock aligned to current low demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Recent sustained lower-demand regime since Period 31 (Periods 32-37 demands = 15,21,11,9,8,22; recent 6-period avg \u2248 14.3), well below earlier high-demand regimes. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service for the new low-demand regime, I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N for demand mean and volatility using the last 6 periods to reflect the sustained decline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical data shows lead time confirmed as 0 periods (sustained evidence from Periods 1-38 arrivals). Demand regime has declined and stabilized at a low level since Period 30 (carry-over: recent declines at P31 and P35). No overdue shipments. I select L=default to use the promised/confirmed lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the current low-demand regime (Periods 30-38) so the base-stock reflects the lower recent mean and reduces excess holding cost. I use sigma recent_N (N=9) to align safety stock with recent variability. These choices reduce orders relative to earlier high-demand regimes and limit holding cost while preserving service under the current lower-demand pattern.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently (P1\u2013P39 arrivals matched same-period orders). Demand has declined and stabilized at a low recent level (Periods 35\u201339 demand = 9,8,22,12,7; 5-period avg = 11.6) following earlier higher regimes. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (default=0) and base demand forecasts on the most recent 5 periods to reflect the current low regime.

Demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 31 (recent 10 periods show persistently low weekly demand). To avoid overstock while preserving service, set L by calculating observed lead times (will be 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and reduce forecasted review+lead demand and volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 31 (Periods 31-41 avg \u224811.6 units/week). On-hand=12, in-transit=0 \u2014 low coverage vs. one-week demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 31-41) so the OR engine targets a much lower base-stock and avoids excess holding costs while keeping service for current low demand. Recent_N on sigma captures reduced volatility in this regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained). Demand has been in a low regime since Period 31 (Periods 31-42 show consistently lower demand vs earlier spikes); I therefore base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent low-demand regime (N=12 covers Periods 31-42), reducing overstock risk while meeting expected low demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times remain 0 (consistent arrivals observed every concluded period). Demand has settled at a low recent level (last 5 concluded demands P39-43 = 7,7,10,16,3; avg\u22488.6) after earlier large swings. To keep the OR backend responsive to the current low-demand regime while using the proven prompt fulfillment behavior, I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the most recent 5 weeks of low demand, reducing excess inventory and holding cost exposure.

Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 40-44 demand = 7,10,16,3,4; recent 5-period avg = 8 units), consistent with the sustained decline noted earlier. No evidence of delayed/lost shipments (many prior concludes show lead_time=0). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand regime, set lead time to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to align the forecast and volatility to the most recent low-demand regime and keep orders conservative.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand has been very low (Periods 41-45 demands = 10,16,3,4,6; avg=7.8). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. No evidence of lead-time change (lead time previously confirmed 0). I set L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime (use last 5 periods). This reduces target base stock and holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand decline at Period 46: Periods 41-45 avg=7.8 vs prior recent avg (Periods 30-34)=14.2 (\u221245%), sustained over last 5 periods

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Periods ~31\u201346 with the most recent 5-period average ~7\u20138 units/week (Periods 41\u201345 noted). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (arrivals concluded same period). To avoid overstock while preserving service, I use promised lead time (default=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent short regime (last 5 periods) so the OR engine targets a much lower base stock and reduces holding cost exposure. I also use recent_N for sigma to reflect the lower recent volatility.
