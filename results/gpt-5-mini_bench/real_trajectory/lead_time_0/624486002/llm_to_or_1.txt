Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11, recent observed demand samples (5 weeks): [47,51,71,68,66], mean=60.6. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations exist (on-hand=0, in-transit=0), so cannot infer longer or variable lead time\u2014use promised lead time. Given symmetric profit and holding cost ($1 profit, $1 holding), use default demand estimates based on all available samples to let the OR backend compute base-stock and caps from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service level (uses historical mean) against holding cost without overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent sell-through: Period1 sold 61 but observed demand was 86 (stockout); historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013Feb) average ~60.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and last order (P1) arrived with lead_time=0. No sustained demand shift (only one high demand period), no evidence of delayed/lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and population-based demand estimates from all samples to avoid overreacting to a single stockout week; this balances service vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two same-period arrivals (Period1 and Period2 orders both arrived with lead_time=0). Historical weekly samples (47,51,71,68,66) give mean \u224860.6. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish for this period's demand. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time (recent concluded lead_times are 0). For demand scale and variability I use defaults so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and limited history\u2014no strong evidence of a regime shift or lost shipments yet.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples (47,51,71,68,66) give mean ~60.6. Observed concluded arrivals for Periods 1-3 show lead_time=0 consistently (orders arrived same period). No delayed or lost shipments. Use default lead time to trust promised L=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 \u2192 z*=0) while avoiding extra inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weekly demand samples: [47,51,71,68,66], mean=60.6, std\u22489.69. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P4 arrived same period). On-hand=37, in-transit=0, so current inventory covers ~0.61 weeks vs. expected (1+L)*mean \u224860.6 units; a replenishment signal exists but OR backend will compute order using base-stock. I choose default lead time (promised L=0) and default demand estimates so the backend uses the full-sample mean and std to set base-stock, balancing service level (uses profit/(profit+holding)=0.5 \u2192 moderate z) vs. holding cost. No evidence of sustained regime change or lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Observed concluded arrivals P1\u2013P5 show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand shows a downward shift: Periods 3\u20135 demands = 56, 30, 52 (avg 46.0) vs earlier Periods 1\u20132 = 86,85 (avg 85.5). To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost, use a recent-window forecast capturing the new lower regime: set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets base stock tuned to the 3-period lower-demand regime and reduces overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: avg decreased from 85.5 (P1\u2013P2) to 46.0 (P3\u2013P5) (\u221246%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 in all periods (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand history (P4\u2013P6 = 30, 52, 128) shows a large spike in P6 but a prior sustained lower regime (P3\u2013P5 avg ~46). To balance service vs holding cost given zero inventory and volatile recent demand, I use promised lead time (default) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 periods so the OR backend emphasizes recent demand while capturing increased variance from the spike. This aims to avoid stockouts this period while limiting excess holding if the spike was transient.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. Recent demand: P1\u2013P7 = [86,85,56,30,52,128,138]; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). A prior sustained downward regime was recorded (Period 3\u20135 avg 46), but P6\u2013P7 show a sharp spike; spikes are not yet 3+ periods so I'll be conservative and bias forecast to recent 5-week behavior to capture the abrupt rise without overreacting to just two points. Promised lead time observed = 0 in concluded history, so use default L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses P3\u2013P7) so the OR backend increases base-stock to improve service during the recent surge while sigma_hat (recent_N) captures elevated volatility. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward: Periods 6\u20138 demands = 128, 138, 175 (avg 147). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. I set L=default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To capture the new high-demand regime, mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 (the 3-period new regime P6\u2013P8). This focuses the forecast and volatility on the sustained spike, increasing service while accepting holding cost given profit=holding. Parameters balance service level vs holding cost by using recent regime stats rather than long-run average which would under-forecast current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 6: avg increased from 46.0 (P3\u2013P5) to 147.0 (P6\u2013P8) (+219%); sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $147.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime from Period 6\u20139 (demands: 128,138,175,177). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all orders arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the current high-demand regime (regime length = 4 periods, N=4). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)\xd7mean based on the last 4 samples, focusing safety stock on the recent elevated mean. For volatility I use recent_N with N=4 so safety stock reflects variability in the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed high-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand data.

Demand regime increased starting Period 6 and has been sustained through Period 10 (high demand P6\u2013P10). Set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead_time=0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead demand forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 6\u201310), giving the OR engine a forecast that matches the sustained elevated demand while limiting exposure to older low-demand data.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). All observed concluded lead times = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P11 arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has jumped: last 3 concluded demands (P9\u2013P11) = 177, 181, 304 \u2014 substantially above earlier regime (P6\u2013P8 avg 147). This suggests the most relevant forecast for the upcoming (review+lead) period is the recent 3-week demand. I choose L=default to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time, mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 so volatility reflects recent variability (including the large 304 observation). These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained upshift observed since Period 6 while keeping variability-informed safety stock to control holding cost. No overdue or in-transit inventory to reconcile (on-hand=0, in-transit=0).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=64, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 6; last 5 demand samples (P8\u2013P12 = 175,177,181,304,157) average \u2248198.8. No delayed/lost shipments (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). To match the recent high-demand regime while using observed lead-time behavior, set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the elevated mean demand over the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock aligned with the recent regime and avoid understocking given current on-hand=64.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=121, in-transit=0. Observed lead times have been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use promised lead time. Recent demand has high variance after the large spike in P11; last 3 periods (P11\u2013P13) suggest a lower post-spike mean (~180 units) vs the earlier spike. To be responsive to the most recent regime, set L=default, mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 demands, and use sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility across the past 5 samples. This balances service (capture the recent elevated mean) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has shifted up vs. the early-sample baseline: last 5 observed demands (P10\u2013P14) = [181,304,157,78,107], average \u2248165.4. All concluded periods show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period repeatedly), so use promised/default lead time=0. On-hand=73, in-transit=0; expected (1+L)-period demand \u2248165 \u2192 we must replenish to cover elevated recent demand while avoiding excess holding cost. I set mu_hat using recent 5 samples to capture the new higher regime and sigma_hat using the same recent window to reflect recent volatility; L left as default to reflect consistent observed lead time=0.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent history shows observed lead_time=0 for all concluded orders (P1\u2013P15). On-hand=37, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Demand has experienced past regime shifts (recorded) but most recent 3 periods are mixed (78,107,129 then 47), so no new sustained change. I choose L=calculate to reflect observed lead times (will compute avg observed = 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples); with L=0 this targets one-period demand using full history, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding so q=0.5. This keeps orders responsive to historical variability while avoiding extra inventory given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows frequent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and demand volatility with recent high peaks but no new sustained regime change since last insights. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover expected (L+1) periods. I use default lead time (promised L=0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, letting the engine set the base-stock and cap given its loss/lead-time model. This keeps parameters simple and leverages full-sample statistics while acknowledging no new confirmed shifts requiring explicit overrides.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded orders show lead_time=0). Recent demand history shows elevated and variable weekly demand (several periods with very high demand P9\u2013P17). I will use the promised/default lead time and let the OR backend compute demand forecast using all samples so base_stock and cap reflect the full historical variability. This keeps service level aligned with observed zero lead time while leveraging backend's statistical estimate to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period 6 (carry-over: regime shift to avg ~147 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current demand risk. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders always arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N to focus the estimate on the post-change regime: choose N=13 covering Period 6\u201318 (regime_length \u224813) to capture the sustained higher mean/volatility. This balances service (captures higher recent mean) against holding cost by avoiding dilution with older low-demand periods. Sigma uses the same recent_N window to reflect current volatility.

LLM Rationale:

Demand shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 6 (P6\u2013P19), so I use recent data to reflect the current elevated mean and variance. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (observed lead_time=0 throughout). Use recent_N (N=14, covering P6\u2013P19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the current high-demand regime, improving service while controlling holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders from P1\u2013P20 arrived same period). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 6 with recent weeks (P13\u2013P20) elevated and volatile; to reflect this I use recent data window to set demand forecast and volatility so the OR base-stock adapts to current high-demand regime while keeping lead time = promised (0). Chosen methods: L=default (promised 0, confirmed historically), mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to capture the recent high-demand regime (periods P13\u2013P20), sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service (capture current elevated mean) against holding cost by using a focused recent sample rather than older low-demand data.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Demand exhibits a sustained high-demand regime beginning at Period 6/9 (carry-over shows shift to ~147 since Period 6\u20138); to capture the current regime I use recent_N over the most recent continuous high-demand regime (use last 16 periods available). Thus: L=default to trust observed 0 lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=16 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the recent high-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=16 to reflect volatility in that same regime. These choices steer the OR engine to provision for the sustained high demand while keeping holding risk tuned to recent variability.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 6; last 5 demands (P19\u2013P23 = 160,170,187,124,136) average ~155, showing sustained elevated demand and moderate volatility. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in history arrived same period). On-hand=20, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the high recent regime. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with concluded history. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the most recent high-demand regime and capture recent volatility; this balances service (higher target) versus holding cost given on-hand inventory is low.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (orders arriving same period), so keep promised lead time. Recent history shows high and variable weekly demand since Period 6 with no new sustained changepoint since prior carry-over insights. With L=0, use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This balances service (captures observed high mean) against holding cost given inventory already low and no in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=12, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and all concluded orders historically had lead_time=0. Recent demand (P21\u2013P25) = [187,124,136,129,113], mean\u2248137.8 and still in the higher regime established earlier. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I use recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat and leave L as default (promised=0). This gives the OR engine a forecast focused on the most recent stable pattern and avoids diluting with much older low-demand weeks.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been lower than earlier peaks; last 5 demand observations (Periods 22\u201326) = [124,136,129,113,77], mean \u2248115.8 and std \u224823.3. On-hand=61, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and recent arrivals have matched promises (no lost shipments). To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding= $1), I target service for the short (L+1) review window using a short-run recent estimate: set L=default (0), mu_hat based on last 5 periods to capture the current regime (N=5), and sigma_hat based on last 5 periods to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the recent downshift while avoiding excessive holding.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent history shows demand variability but no NEW sustained changepoint since prior recorded insights. Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full historical mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0) so base_stock will equal mu_hat.

Recent demand has been modest (last 4\u20135 weeks: 77,73,82,60,60[prior]) so I target a short-horizon forecast using recent data to reflect the current lower regime and avoid excess holding cost. Set L=default to use promised 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 5 samples, keeping replenishment responsive to the current lower-demand regime and limiting overstock risk.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled lower after the spikes earlier in the year (carry-over insights: regime shifts recorded previously). Last 5 observed demands (P26\u2013P30) = [77,73,82,60,33], recent mean=65. I keep L as default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To reflect the recent lower regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent stable pattern and meets the N selection rules). This reduces over-ordering vs. using long-run mean while allowing the OR backend to compute safety stock based on recent volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent on-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use default promised L=0. Demand has fallen in the most recent 5 weeks (P27\u2013P31: 73,82,60,33,18); I therefore use a recent_N forecast to capture the lower current mean and reduced variability. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat with recent_N, N=5 focuses the OR engine on the most recent demand regime and avoids overstock from earlier high-demand periods. This balances service (cover near-term demand) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

All concluded lead-time observations show lead_time=0 (no evidence of delay). Use L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new lower regime (N=5 balances recency and sample size). Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect current variability and avoid overstating uncertainty from earlier high-demand periods. These settings lower target base-stock to reduce holding cost while preserving service for the current demand regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=13, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals in concluded history. Observed lead times historically = 0 periods (orders repeatedly arrived same period), so keep promised/default lead time. Recent demand has fallen sharply in last 5 weeks (P29\u2013P33: 60,33,18,16,29) versus prior weeks. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, I use a short recent-window forecast: set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 samples to reflect the new lower demand regime. This keeps base-stock small and reduces overstock risk given holding cost = profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg decreased from 73.0 (P26\u2013P29) to 21.0 (P31\u2013P33) (\u221271%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand is low and stable following the confirmed regime shift around Period 30: last 4 demands = [16,29,20,15], mean \u224820. On-hand=6, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments observed (all concluded lead_times=0 historically). To keep service while limiting holding cost I set lead time to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand is low/stable vs earlier spikes: last 7 demands (P31\u2013P36) = 18,16,29,20,15,12 (avg ~18.3). On-hand=8, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all historical samples\u2014this leverages full sample history while keeping policy simple given no new sustained changepoint since Period 34. This balances service (using long-run demand estimate) against holding cost given current low on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0. I choose L=default to trust promised 0-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime and low volatility so the OR backend reduces ordering and holding cost exposure.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times remain 0 historically (no evidence of change) so keep L=default. Recent demand has settled to a lower regime since ~Period 31 (demands P31\u2013P38 = 18,16,29,20,15,12,15,7; recent mean \u224813.8). To capture this sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N=8 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine sets base-stock to reflect current lower demand and avoid excess holding cost. No new sustained lead-time or seasonal signals to record.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=63, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods; no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Demand has been in a low regime since Period 31 (P31\u2013P39 demands: 18,16,29,20,15,12,15,7,17 \u2014 9 samples). No new sustained changepoint detected. Set L=default to use promised lead time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture the current low-demand regime (use the last 9 observed demands) so the OR backend targets inventory for this lower-demand period and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service level.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals: lead_time=0). Recent demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 31 (demands roughly 33,18,16,29,20,15,12,15,7,17,14 -> recent 10 mean \u224813.3). No overdue shipments. To keep inventory aligned with the sustained low-demand regime while the backend uses promised L=0, I set L=default (promised), and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the low-demand regime and reduce excess holding cost risk.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (P38\u2013P41) show low demand (7,17,14,7) after a prior regime shift; no concluded arrivals or lead-time changes observed (all historical concluded lead_times = 0). To avoid overreacting to a short low-demand run and because promised lead time remains 0 with many historical zero lead-time observations, use default lead time and population-wide demand statistics so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service vs holding cost given current moderate on-hand stock and no in-transit coverage.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=73, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been low and stable over the last 5 concluded weeks (Periods 38\u201342 demands = 7,17,14,7,19; mean=12.8), indicating a sustained low-demand regime since Period 37. Use promised lead time (default L=0). For demand forecast, use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks). Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent low volatility. These choices reduce ordering to match the sustained lower demand and limit holding cost while preserving service given current on-hand stock.

No evidence of lead-time deviation (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Set L to default (promised=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime and lower volatility, letting the OR backend size orders to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand while limiting holding cost exposure.

Promised lead time=0 and recent concluded arrivals confirm 0 historically; no evidence of lost shipments. To avoid excess holding cost vs small profit (profit=holding), target the current low-demand regime using recent data. Set L to default (promised lead time=0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 (captures Periods 37\u201344 average demand across review+lead). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent low volatility. These parameters align base-stock to low current demand and reduce overstock risk while maintaining service.

Recent weekly demand low (Periods 41\u201345: 7,19,9,7,14) after earlier regime shifts; no evidence of changed lead time (all concluded lead_times = 0). To keep inventory aligned with the current low-demand regime, use L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent mean demand (~11.2 units/week). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent low volatility. This keeps base_stock near current demand (z*=0 since profit=holding), avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=25, in-transit=0 \u2014 available stock is small but roughly in line with the recent depressed demand regime. No evidence of lead-time shifts (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0). To make the forecast responsive to the clear low-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend base-stock and cap reflect the last 5 weeks' mean and variability, reducing overstock risk while preserving service for current demand levels.
