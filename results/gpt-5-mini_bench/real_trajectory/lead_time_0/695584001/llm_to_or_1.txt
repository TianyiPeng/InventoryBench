Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward trend (0,0,37,61,109) with the last three weeks averaging ~69 units/week; on-hand and in-transit are zero so we must cover current period demand. Promised lead time is 0 and no concluded arrivals exist, so use promised lead time (default) to keep OR engine expectations aligned. For demand, use a recent_N estimate focusing on the last 3 samples to capture the new higher-demand regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=3) to reflect increased volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize meeting rising demand this week while allowing the OR backend to compute service-level stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=100, lead_time=0), confirming actual lead time = 0 so far. Recent demand shows variability with some increases but not a sustained 3+ period shift; therefore I use observed lead time (calculate) and default demand estimates to let the OR engine compute base-stock balancing $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in same period (lead_time observed=0 twice). Recent demand samples (most recent periods: 2019-02-04:109, P1:63, P2:90 and earlier weeks) indicate elevated recent demand vs earlier zeros. I set L to 'calculate' to use the observed lead times (confirmed 0). For mu_hat I choose 'recent_N' with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures the recent higher demand regime). For sigma_hat I use 'default' to let the backend compute volatility across all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat from recent data) while using confirmed short lead time to avoid over-pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands: P1=63, P2=90, P3=60 (avg\u224871) \u2014 materially higher than the small Jan samples, indicating a new demand regime. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods. No overdue shipments. To capture the recent regime, set L to default (promised=0) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the three most recent weeks, which balances service level for elevated demand against holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent observed weekly demand has been stable around 57\u201390 (Period1=63, P2=90, P3=60, P4=57). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0; use that to set L. To capture the recent demand regime, use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (the four most recent demand observations) so the base-stock reflects current demand levels and variability while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed 0) and steady weekly demand (concluded demands: 63,90,60,57,48; on-hand=33, in-transit=0). No overdue shipments. Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with observed 0-period arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, letting the OR engine set a base-stock that balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost given the observed demand variability.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded weeks show stable weekly demand: [63, 90, 60, 57, 48, 59] with ending on-hand 23 and zero in-transit. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods (orders arriving same period). I select L=default to use promised lead time (0). To keep the forecast responsive to the most recent six weeks, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 6 samples; this balances service (captures recent demand level and variability) against holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and same-period replenishment.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized demands (Periods 1-7) = [63,90,60,57,48,59,74]; on-hand=1, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To capture the most recent demand regime I use the last 7 observed demand periods for forecasting (N=7). This keeps the (1+L)*mean responsive to recent variation while sigma uses the same window to reflect current volatility. Parameters balance service (avoid stockout with low on-hand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than long-ago samples.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent realized weekly demands (Periods 1\u20138) = [63,90,60,57,48,59,74,68]; on-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving same period (lead time=0). I choose L by calculating observed lead times to reinforce confirmed 0-period lead time. Demand appears stable with no sustained regime shift; use recent_N=8 to capture the full recent sample for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base_stock reflecting current weekly demand. This balances service (use recent demand mean) against holding cost by relying on recent volatility for safety stock rather than inflating mean.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand (Periods 1-9) has averaged moderate weekly sales with no observed delivery delays: all concluded arrivals show lead time 0. On-hand=25, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (should confirm 0). I choose default demand and volatility calculations so the OR backend uses the full sample history to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. This keeps parameters responsive to all observed demand while relying on confirmed zero lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent realized lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed in Period 3 conclude and all subsequent concludes). On-hand=34, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand has averaged moderate levels (roughly 50-65 units/week across history). Promised lead time remains 0 so use default lead time to match the supplier promise and confirmed observations. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from all historical samples, which balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while letting the engine apply its capped order logic given reliable zero lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201311) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and stable weekly demand around 50\u201370 units. On-hand=23, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I use L=default (promised lead time 0) because lead time was confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine set the base-stock and cap consistent with historical variability and the profit/holding tradeoff. This keeps service level targeted while avoiding excess holding given moderate holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded history (Periods 1-12) shows consistent same-period arrivals and demand around 47-74/week with current on-hand=30, in-transit=0. Promised lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior conclude messages, so keep L at default. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default sigma (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend applies its base-stock and cap formulas using the full historical sample set. This balances service (high profit-to-cost ratio q=0.8) against holding cost while accounting for zero lead time and current modest on-hand stock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concluded history (Periods 1\u201313) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in Period 3 insight). Inventory is adequate for near-term demand but no pipeline cover exists. I use default lead time to trust the promised/observed 0-period lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the policy aligned with long-run historical demand, avoids overfitting to recent low demand (Period 13=27), and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Observed lead times have been 0 in concluded history; use promised/default L to reflect reliable same-period arrivals. Recent demand has declined over the last 4 periods (Periods 11-14: demands 56,49,27,22) so I downweight long-run mean and set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new lower regime while retaining a small smoothing window. Sigma is set to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep safety stock responsive to the recent demand drop while avoiding overstock given holding cost >0 and zero in-transit units.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting around Period 13: prior long-run avg ~53 (Periods 1-10/earlier), recent avg (Periods 11-14)=38.5 (-~27%), sustained for 4 periods.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen: last four demands = {49,27,22,14}, confirming the previously noted regime shift starting ~Period 13. Lead time historically confirmed as 0. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history shows consistent 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new lower-demand regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 4 samples). Sigma uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock to match the sustained lower demand, lowering holding cost while preserving service against current demand pattern.

Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N (N=4) for demand mean and volatility (captures P13-16). Using default lead time (promised=0) keeps OR engine expectations aligned with observed arrivals. These settings reduce target base stock and cap orders to limit holding cost while maintaining service for the new lower demand level.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (multiple P arrivals same period). Recent demand has settled lower after a regime shift around Period 13: demands since P13 = [27,22,14,8,12] (P13\u2013P17) \u2014 regime length 5. To capture the new lower-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0, confirmed). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (use the last 5 samples to reflect the post-changepoint mean/volatility). This keeps the base-stock tied to the current low-demand regime, reducing excess holding cost while preserving service given confirmed zero lead time and no in-transit stock.

Lead time historically confirmed as 0. To reflect the lower recent regime, set L to promised (default=0) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 6 periods (captures the post-changepoint regime). This keeps target stock aligned with the lower demand to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has fallen sharply since Period 13: demands P13-P19 = [27,22,14,8,12,8,18] (avg \u2248 15.86). On-hand=4, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (matches confirmed 0). I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime (regime length 7, so N=7). This biases the base-stock toward the lower, current demand to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 13: avg demand P1-10 \u224853 (historic), recent avg P13-19 \u224815.86 (\u221270%), sustained for 7 periods (P13\u2013P19).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P20 arrived same period) so set L to calculated average (0). Demand shows a sustained downshift starting ~P13 (P13\u2013P19 avg \u224815.86, 7 periods); I treat this as the current regime for forecasting. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7 to capture the lower recent mean and volatility over the current regime. These choices keep target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while preserving service for the confirmed lower-demand regime. No overdue shipments to reconcile (arrivals have been concluded timely).

Recent demand shows high volatility with a sharp uptick in Periods 20\u201321; to respond to this recent regime while limiting inventory risk I use recent_N estimates based on the most recent data. L uses default (promised 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast and variability on the last 5 demand observations, helping the OR backend raise the base stock to cover the recent demand spike while keeping cap constraints to limit overordering.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 and recent demand has spiked sharply in Periods 20-22 (53,77,109) after a low regime (P13-19 avg ~15.9). To respond quickly I keep L = default (promised 0, confirmed by history). For demand scale I use an EWMA to weight the recent surge while smoothing older low-demand periods (mu_hat: EWMA_gamma with gamma=0.3). For volatility I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the increased variance from the recent spike period while including a few prior observations (N=7 covers P16\u2013P22). These settings bias orders upward to recover service during the current spike while limiting overreaction to a single-period blip.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 20: recent avg P20-22 = 79.67 vs prior P13-19 avg \u224815.86 (+~402%), sustained for 3 periods (P20\u2013P22).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has shifted sharply upwards starting Period 20 (periods 20\u201324 demands = 53,77,109,173,106) \u2014 current regime length = 5. On-hand=41, in-transit=0 so no pipeline coverage; historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. To respond to the sustained higher-demand regime, set lead time to the observed average and use a recent-N forecast (most recent 5 weeks) for mean and volatility so the OR engine raises target stock to cover the new spike while keeping holding cost in mind.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=74, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time=0 across all arrivals. Demand has recently been volatile with a high-demand regime in Periods 23\u201325 (demands 173,106,68). To respond to this most recent regime while keeping inventory risk controlled, I use calculated L from observed lead times (avg=0) and recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the last 3 weeks of demand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=74, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders arrived same period). Recent demand elevated and volatile: Periods 23-26 demands = 173,106,68,87 (regime from P23, length=4). To reflect the recent post-spike regime while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed concludes, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the most recent 4 weeks of demand (captures the spike and subsequent moderation). This raises target stock to protect service during higher recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability; together they balance service level (higher profit per unit) against holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (P1\u2013P27). Recent demand (Periods 19\u201327: 18,53,77,109,173,106,68,87,91) is elevated and more volatile than the long-run; I therefore bias the forecast to the recent regime. Use L=default to trust concluded lead-time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (captures the full recent high-demand spell from P19\u2013P27). This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to current high demand while the sigma estimate accounts for increased volatility, balancing service level (high q from profit/holding) against holding cost. On-hand=56, in-transit=0 \u2014 parameters aim to replenish to cover current period+lead demand using recent demand stats.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many periods P1\u2013P28). Demand shifted up starting Period 20 and has been high and sustained through Periods 20\u201328 (recent sample mean \u224894.7 over last 9 periods). To target service while avoiding excess hold, set L based on observed lead times and set demand estimates using recent data from the high-demand regime: L use calculate (observed lead time=0); mu_hat use recent_N with N=9 to capture the new high-demand regime (1+L times mean of last 9 demands \u224894.7); sigma_hat use recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend builds a base-stock appropriate for the elevated demand and minimal lead time, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 20 (P20\u2013P29 demands = [53,77,109,173,106,68,87,91,88,89], avg ~94). On-hand=35, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arrivals visible next period. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (concluded arrivals each period). To capture the recent high-demand regime I set L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (last 10 periods P20\u2013P29) so the OR engine's base-stock and cap reflect the elevated mean and volatility; this balances higher service level needs against holding cost given profit/holding ratio (q=0.8 -> high target service level).

LLM Rationale:

Demand regime since Period 20 shows sustained higher demand (Periods 20\u201330: 11 samples) so use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean and volatility over the high-demand regime. This balances service (covering (1+L) periods of elevated demand) against holding cost given on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent history shows lead time consistently observed as 0 periods (many concluded arrivals with W=0), and a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 20 (Periods 20\u201331 demand elevated). On-hand=61, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I therefore keep L as promised (default). For demand I target the confirmed recent regime (P20\u2013P31) using recent_N to capture its mean and volatility (regime length = 12 weeks), so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=12. This emphasizes service in the current high-demand regime while the OR backend will compute safety stock given profit/holding tradeoff.

Demand shifted up starting Period 20 (sustained high demand P20\u2013P32); use recent_N over the recent high-demand regime to set forecast and volatility so the OR engine raises base-stock to meet the elevated demand while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). Recent demand sharply increased starting Period 20 and has been sustained through Period 33: mean demand P20\u2013P33 \u224885.4 units/week (14 samples) versus prior depressed regime P13\u2013P19 \u224815.9. On-hand=43, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historically confirmed actual L=0. I set L=default to use promised lead time (observed lead time consistently 0). To capture the new high-demand regime, I use recent_N with N=14 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (regime length P20\u2013P33 = 14 periods) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the sustained high-demand window. This increases target base-stock to better cover upcoming high weekly demand while the capped policy limits extreme over-ordering given holding cost.

Recent demand (Periods 30-34 = 71,58,55,71,69) shows a stable higher regime vs earlier low/volatile periods; use a short recent_N window to capture current weekly demand. I choose mu_hat recent_N N=5 and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to align base-stock to the last 5 weeks of realized demand, balancing service level (using recent higher mean) against holding cost given current positive on-hand inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand has rebounded since the low periods (P20\u2013P22 spike then sustained higher weekly sales through Sept/Oct). To balance service vs holding cost I keep promised lead time (default=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent 7 weeks to capture the current higher-demand regime while limiting responsiveness to short blips. Using recent_N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute a base-stock that reflects current mean and volatility; default lead time avoids inferring spurious delays when all concluded LT observations are 0.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P37 arrived same period). Demand regime: sustained higher demand since Period 20 (P20\u2013P37 average ~60\u201390 range) \u2014 changepoint at Period 20 is supported by multiple subsequent periods of elevated demand. To keep service while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time (default L=0) and estimate demand from the recent high-demand regime using recent_N over the last 18 periods (P20\u2013P37) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds a base-stock reflecting the current sustained higher demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple P1\u2013P38 confirms). Recent demand (Periods 34\u201338 = 69,60,83,97,49) suggests a higher-but-volatile regime; to be responsive I set parameters using recent_N=5 so the OR backend targets current demand levels while capping orders. This balances service (capture recent spikes) vs. holding cost given on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving same period (lead time observed=0 in multiple periods), and recent demand shows no new sustained regime change since prior carry-over insights. With promised lead time = 0 and no new changepoint, use default lead time and demand statistics so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This keeps service vs. holding tradeoff aligned with historical data and avoids overreacting to short-term variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Recent 10-week demand (P31\u2013P40) averages ~65 units/week with notable variability; no new sustained changepoint since supplied carry-over insights. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To adapt to the recent higher-demand regime and variance, set lead time to promised (default) and use recent_N=10 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets a base-stock reflecting current demand while capping orders to limit overstock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show persistent lead_time=0 (confirmed in prior periods). Recent demand shows a moderate regime with higher volatility since Period 35; last 7 demand samples (Periods 35\u201341) have mean \u224860.1 and capture current demand level post-regime shifts. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed lead time=0. I choose mu_hat recent_N (N=7) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean using the most recent regime, avoiding stale long-run averages. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=7) to reflect current volatility. These choices keep target base stock aligned with recent realized demand (improving service) while avoiding excess inventory from older high-demand periods, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals \u2014 actual lead time confirmed 0 (multiple periods). Recent demand has increased since mid-year; last 7 concluded period demands (P36\u2013P42) average ~59.4, capturing the recent higher-volume regime through late Oct\u2013Nov. To balance profit vs holding cost with current low pipeline and a confirmed 0 lead time, set L=default (use promised 0), forecast demand using recent_N N=7 to reflect the current regime, and set sigma_hat using recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps service high during the recent elevated demand while limiting excess inventory buildup given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been volatile but the last 5 weeks (Periods 39\u201343 demands = 58,34,40,55,17) average \u224840.8 and shows no new sustained regime beyond prior carry-overs. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 target service quantile moderate), I set L by calculated observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 0). For demand I use a recent_N=5 estimate so mu_hat reflects the most recent realized demand level and adapts to the late-Nov/early-Dec pattern. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility for safety stock sizing.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show consistent actual lead time=0 (many periods) and no new sustained demand regime shift in the last 3+ periods (recent demands: P42=55, P43=17, P44=10 \u2014 short low spell only). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed 0 lead time and long-run demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand moments (uses all samples). This avoids overreacting to the 1\u20132 period low demand blips and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Recent demand shows a lower/variable regime vs earlier high-season spikes; last 7 concluded demands (P40\u2013P46) = [34,40,55,17,10,32,17] with a recent mean \u224830.7 and noticeable volatility. To adapt to the current regime while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 samples (recent_N N=7) so the OR backend targets a base stock tuned to current demand and observed variability.
