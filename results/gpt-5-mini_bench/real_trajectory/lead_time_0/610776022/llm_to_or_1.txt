Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable demand (avg ~176/week). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence; no sustained changepoint detected. Use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service vs holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/02/18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. History: Period 1 order (177) arrived same period (lead_time=0) and demand was 267 (one high demand observation). No sustained demand regime change (only one high-demand period). No overdue shipments. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time (average of observed lead times = 0). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses all historical samples (no premature shift from a single high week). This balances service level (capture historical mean) versus holding cost while we await more periods to confirm a new demand regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent realized demand was high (Period1 demand=267, Period2 demand=354) and on-hand+in-transit = 0, so we must replenish to cover imminent demand. Concluded history shows two arrivals with lead_time=0 (ordered P1 arrived P1; ordered P2 arrived P2) but this is only 2 observations\u2014below the 3+ period threshold for a sustained update\u2014so retain the default lead time and use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances service level (using observed demand samples) against holding cost while avoiding overreaction to a short 2-period signal.

Daily Reward (R_t): $215.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-3) = [267, 354, 277], substantially above earlier sample mean (2019 Jan samples mean=176.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must plan for elevated demand. Observed concluded lead times for prior arrivals = 0 periods (orders in P1-P3 all arrived with lead_time=0), so use promised lead time. I set L=default to keep lead time = promised (0). Demand forecast uses recent_N on the last 3 realized demands to capture the new higher regime ((1+L)*mean of [267,354,277] = 299.33 expected demand over review+lead). Volatility is set using recent_N with N=3 to reflect variability in the new regime. These parameters push the OR engine to target a higher base stock to avoid stockouts under the sustained higher demand while sigma from recent data sets safety stock consistent with observed variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Jan sample mean=176.4 vs recent Periods 1-3 mean=299.3 (+69.8%); sustained for 3 periods (267,354,277).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand history shows high recent demand (Periods1-3: 267,354,277) with a drop in Period4 (166); prior Jan samples averaged ~176.4. Observed concluded lead times = 0 in all arrivals, so use observed lead time. To capture the most relevant recent demand regime while smoothing the Period4 dip, set L based on observed lead times and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 4 demand samples: 267,354,277,166). These parameters balance service (cover recent higher demand) against holding cost by relying on recent demand variability rather than all-time averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $74.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (orders from P1-P5 all arrived same period), so use calculated lead time. Demand has shifted upward vs. the Jan sample (recent weekly demands: 267,354,277,166,170); to prioritize recent demand while smoothing noise I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.4). For volatility I use recent_N=5 to capture current variability. These settings raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while capping excess inventory via the OR engine's cap to limit holding cost exposure.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands (Periods 4-6): 166,170,310 \u2014 elevated and volatile versus earlier Jan samples. All observed arrivals show lead time = 0 (orders in P1-P6 arrived same period). To prioritize service with current zero inventory and short confirmed lead time, set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate => 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 4-6) so the OR engine responds to the recent higher/volatile demand while limiting excess hold costs.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all prior orders arrived with lead_time=0 (Periods 1-7), so set L by observed average. Recent demand (last 3 concluded periods: Periods 5-7 = 170,310,256) reflects the current regime; use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for this recent demand level while keeping holding cost in check.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders ordered and arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 4-8 = 166,170,310,256,204) shows a higher regime than the original Jan samples; I use a recent-window forecast to capture current demand. Set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) -> 0. Set mu_hat as recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)*mean of last 5 demands and capture current regime. Set sigma_hat as recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters align base-stock to current demand while avoiding over-reliance on stale Jan data and accounting for low observed lead time, helping OR balance service vs holding cost.

Recent demand shows a higher, variable regime vs Jan samples; using recent_N=5 (Periods 5\u20139 demands: 170,310,256,204,173) to capture current mean and volatility for (1+L) review+lead demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand since the confirmed Jan regime shift (Period 4) has been higher but stabilized over the last 7 periods (Periods 4\u201310). On-hand=17, in-transit=0 so coverage is low; promised LT=0 but observed arrivals have consistently been same-period (lead_time=0). I set L by calculating the average observed lead time (returns 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (regime length from Period 4\u201310) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the post-changepoint regime (balances service vs holding cost by sizing to recent realized demand and volatility).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (every concluded order arrived same period), so promised lead time is reliable. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: 256,204,173,206,291) averages ~226 \u2014 demand remains above the older Jan samples and the previously recorded regime shift. To balance $1 profit vs $1 holding cost (q=0.5) and react to recent demand, set L to promised (default=0), use a recent_N mu_hat to reflect the last 5 periods' mean demand across the review+lead window, and use recent_N sigma_hat to capture recent variability (N=5). This keeps service responsive to the recent higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holdings given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (all concluded lead_times=0) and volatile weekly demand averaging ~236 across samples with several stockouts; current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover (1+L) demand. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (backend will average concluded lead times, which are all 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples \u2014 this balances service vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1 each) and no strong new regime signal since the Period 4 insight is already recorded.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13. On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show observed lead_time=0 in all arrivals \u2192 use promised/default lead time to keep timing aligned. Recent demand shows a modestly lower recent regime (last 3 demands = 291, 278, 168); use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory to the most recent demand level and variance rather than older higher-demand weeks. This balances service (protect against current-week demand) vs holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent observed lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Demand has moderated since the large early-Jan/Feb spikes; the most recent 6 weeks (Periods 9-14 demands = 173,206,291,278,168,161; mean \u2248212.8) represent the current regime. I set L by calculating observed lead time average to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current demand regime and avoids overstock from earlier higher-demand periods. This balances service (by sizing to recent mean) against holding cost given profit=holding, keeping safety stock moderate via the backend z* calculation.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in every observed period (orders arrived same period). Recent demand has varied but shows no new sustained regime change beyond the previously recorded Period 4 insight. Given stable observed lead time and no new sustained demand shift, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples; this balances service vs holding cost without overfitting recent noise.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands (P1-P16) show no sustained regime shift since the earlier Period 4 insight; recent weeks average around ~200 units. All observed arrivals have lead_time=0 consistently. To keep policy aligned with observed lead time and stable demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine uses full-sample mean/std (with (1+L) scaling). This balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) while avoiding unnecessary holding given zero inventory and no delivery delays.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201317) shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly) and current on-hand=19, in-transit=0. No evidence of lost or delayed shipments. Demand across concluded periods centers ~200 units/week with variability; prior carry-over noted a Jan regime shift (already recorded). I therefore keep lead time at the promised/default (L=0). To let the OR backend compute base-stock using full-sample demand statistics, I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so they are (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) respectively. This balances service level vs holding cost by letting the engine compute safety stock from historical mean/variance while honoring the low promised lead time and current low on-hand inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all past arrivals show lead_time=0). Demand history shows the earlier documented Jan regime shift but subsequent weekly demands through Period 18 are mixed; no new sustained changepoint since previous insight. Given consistent observed lead time and to let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics, I select default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps L anchored to the promised/observed 0 and lets the capped base-stock calculation balance service level vs holding cost (profit=holding, so target service quantile is 0.5).

Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 consistently (orders in P1\u2013P19 all arrived same period). Demand history is stable with multiple recent weeks; profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) implying q=0.5 (median service target). I set L via calculate to reflect the observed average lead time (0). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples, which is appropriate given no detected new demand regime beyond the previously recorded Period 4 insight and equal profit/holding (moderate service, avoid excess holding).

Recent demand has stabilized around ~200/week though initial Jan samples averaged 176.4; no new sustained changepoint detected. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base-stock from the full sample mean/variance. This lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost, relying on the engine's capped ordering to avoid excessive inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent history shows stable weekly demand mostly between ~140\u2013240 with prior Jan spike noted in carry-over. On-hand=71, in-transit=0 so pipeline short of covering upcoming demand; no evidence of lead-time slips (all concluded lead_times=0). I choose L=default to trust promised 0-period lead time and keep OR engine's lead-time assumption. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so backend uses full-sample mean and std (scaled by 1+L) \u2014 this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost and avoids overreacting to transient swings. No new sustained regime or lead-time changes detected.

Recent demand (Periods 13-22) average = 176.6 units/week (10 samples) \u2014 lower and steadier than early high spikes. To keep the OR base-stock responsive to the recent lower regime while avoiding overweighting old high values, set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most recent 10 samples.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has declined over the last 3 periods (Periods 21-23: 143,129,106) vs longer-run mean ~210. On-hand=71, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Use promised lead time (0) because historical concluded lead times remain 0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new lower-demand regime (3 consecutive lower periods), which reduces target base-stock and holding risk given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has trended down over the last 5 periods (152,143,129,106,70), suggesting a lower recent demand regime vs earlier months. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. For uncertainty I use recent_N (N=5) so sigma reflects recent variability. These choices reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given current lower demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=68, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods; no lost shipments observed. Demand history (including Jan samples) shows no new sustained regime change since prior insight. Profit and holding cost equal ($1/$1) implies q=0.5; use default lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/std. This balances service level vs holding cost given stable history and current on-hand coverage.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. On-hand=160, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (all arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep L at promised (default). Demand has fallen sharply in recent weeks (Periods 23-26: 106,70,52,35); I use recent_N=4 to capture the current low-demand regime for both mean and volatility so the OR engine reduces replenishment and holding costs. This respects the pipeline coverage rule (1+L periods) and trades service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: average demand P23-26=65.75 vs prior P19-22 avg=146.5 (\u221255%), sustained 4 periods (106,70,52,35).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=122, in-transit=0. Historical lead times have been 0 (orders concluded same period), so use L default (promised). Recent demand regime has been lower since Period 23 (demands P23-27 = 106,70,52,35,38); use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower mean/variance and avoid excess holding given profit=holding ($1/$1 => target service quantile=50%). This reduces recommended base-stock versus using the long-run mean and limits holding cost with minimal service-level loss.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand downshift confirmed (Periods 23-28 avg \u2248 57 units/week vs prior ~146); on-hand=79, in-transit=0 so current stock covers ~1.4 weeks at recent rate. No overdue arrivals observed. Set L=default because historical concluded lead times remain 0. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=6) to capture the new low-demand regime (Periods 23-28). This reduces target base-stock to match the lower demand, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen and a lower-demand regime is sustained since Period 23 (P23-29 demands: 106,70,52,35,38,43,35) \u2014 current weeks are far below earlier averages. No evidence of delayed/lost shipments (all concluded lead_times = 0). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service in the new low-demand regime, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent sustained regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covering P23\u2013P29) so the OR engine targets replenishment appropriate for the lower, sustained demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (P27-30) show a sustained low-demand regime (demands 38,43,35,42). Lead times historically conclude as 0 when ordered; no evidence of delays or lost shipments. I set L=default to trust promised 0. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 4 periods (regime length=4). sigma_hat also uses recent_N with N=4 to capture recent low volatility. These parameters reduce ordering to match lower demand and limit holding cost given high holding=profit parity.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 23 (sustained low: P23-31). Actual lead time history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. I set L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N to capture the current low-demand regime: N=9 (Periods 23-31) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes the (1+L) forecast and safety stock to recent lower mean/volatility. This prevents overstock while covering near-term demand given no pipeline.

Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 23 (sustained lower weekly demand P23\u2013P32), so I base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (regime length P23\u2013P32 = 10) so (1+L)-period demand and volatility reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid overstating inventory that would increase holding cost while preserving service level.

For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the post-Period-23 lower-demand regime (reduces forecast and safety stock to avoid holding cost). This selection balances service vs holding cost by basing base-stock on the lower, sustained demand regime and the short lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. Recent demand has settled at the lower post-change regime identified at Period 23 (sustained lower mean). On-hand=14, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period only (promised lead time=0). I set L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (historical concluded arrivals consistently show 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime (Periods 30-34 demands = 42,34,34,33,33) so mu_hat reflects the most recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk by sizing base stock to the current low-demand regime while maintaining service for the immediate period.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=11, in-transit=0 so low stock vs typical recent weekly demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time=0. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to anchor the (1+L) forecast to the current low-demand regime. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk from older high-demand periods while preserving service for the current lower demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $16.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-10-21: demand has been in a lower regime since Period 23 (sustained ~35\u201370 weekly sales). On-hand=8, in-transit=0 so risk of stockout is present this period. Promised lead time=0 with all observed conclues showing 0 \u2014 use default promised L. To reflect the sustained lower regime I use recent_N for demand estimates over the last 10 concluded periods (P27\u2013P36) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the new lower mean and volatility without overreacting to older high-demand weeks. This keeps base_stock aligned to recent demand and limits holding given profit=holding ($1 vs $1) which yields a conservative service level.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 23 (sustained low sales ~35-70); on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so risk of stockout exists. Historical concluded lead times are 0; use calculate to confirm L=0. To capture the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (covering Periods 23-37) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility rather than the higher older mean. This balances service against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand is low following the sustained down-regime identified earlier (Periods 23-26). On-hand=26, in-transit=0 \u2014 modest cover for ~1 week of demand. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0; no evidence of delays or lost shipments. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (most recent demands: P34-38 = 34,25,24,38,17) so mu_hat reflects the latest mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This keeps target stocking tight to avoid holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (all concluded orders had lead_time 0). Recent demand since the regime shift at Period 23 has been lower and sustained (many periods with weekly demand ~30\u201340). On-hand=20, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Choose L='default' to use promised lead time (0) since concluded history confirms it. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=17 (Periods 23\u201339 regime length=17) so the (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the current low-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=17 to capture current volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the confirmed low-demand regime, avoiding excess holding given profit=holding and empty pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical lead times observed = 0 consistently (orders concluded same period). Demand has been in a low regime since Period 23 (sustained lower weekly demand). On-hand ~25 already covers about one week of current low demand; to avoid excess holding cost I keep L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime (capture most recent 11 weeks, reducing mean/variance relative to the long-run). This biases orders downward to balance profit vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period so use promised lead time. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 23 (sustained low demand vs earlier year); recent demand samples (Periods 23\u201341, 19 samples) are the most relevant for forecasting. I set L=default to keep backend lead-time assumption (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=19 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (reduces ordering to avoid excess holding) while capturing recent demand variability for safety stock. This balances service level and high holding cost (profit=holding), favoring lower inventory consistent with observed lower demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods. Recent demand (Periods 38-42 = 17,8,15,13,22) is low and appears stable over the last 5 periods. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0). To make the backend responsive to the recent low-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and uncertainty reflect the most recent five concluded demands, keeping orders small and limiting holding cost while maintaining service. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 40-43 demands = 15,13,22,6; recent mean=14) suggesting a sustained lower-demand regime versus earlier high-season values. Promised lead time = 0 with no late/lost shipments in concluded history so use default lead time. To reflect the recent lower demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 (captures the 4-period low-demand regime). This reduces target base_stock and holding costs while maintaining service for the current low-demand environment.

Demand has been in the lower post-Period-23 regime (sustained lower weekly demand); keep forecast based on full-sample default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and variance scaling, which balances service vs holding given equal profit and holding cost. Using default sigma to reflect full-sample variability. This keeps orders conservative given low pipeline and small on-hand.

Recent demand is in a low regime (Periods 41-45 demands = 13,22,6,3,8; mean=10.4) after the summer-to-fall drop already recorded in carry-overs. To avoid excess holding given profit=holding, set mu_hat using the recent 5-week mean scaled by (1+L).
