Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (weekly data through 2019-02-04). No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no overdue shipments. Use promised lead time (default) because no evidence to change it. Demand history (22,11,20,13,41) shows mean ~21.4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (5): [22,11,20,13,41]. Period 1 concluded an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=22, lead_time=0). Single recent observed demand=60 was heavily censored by stockout (sold=22) \u2014 not enough sustained evidence to treat as a new demand regime. I therefore confirm lead time = 0 and use population-based demand estimates: set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, balancing service (using all available demand history) against holding costs while avoiding overreaction to one high but censored demand observation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order placed P1 arrived P1)

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25): on-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent concluded history shows orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived same period \u2192 lead time confirmed as 0. Demand history (5 weekly samples: 22,11,20,13,41) shows no sustained regime shift; use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters tied to full-sample estimates and leverages confirmed 0 lead time to let the OR engine set base-stock balancing $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent concluded periods show sharp demand increase: Periods 1-3 sold 22/28/35 due to stockouts but observed demand (conclude) was 60, 77, 98 indicating true demand has risen above historical Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). Promised LT=0 and all concluded arrivals indicate actual LT=0; use calculate to let backend confirm. To capture the recent demand regime shift, use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last three observed demand samples (period demands 60,77,98). This raises the base-stock to cover the new higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety for variability, balancing service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $79.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=0; last four observed weekly demands (Periods 1-4) show a clear higher-demand regime: 60, 77, 98, 89 (mean=81). Lead time history (concluded messages) consistently shows 0 periods. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (gives mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent = 1*81). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to reflect volatility in the latest regime. These choices raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while keeping holding exposure minimal because holding cost equals profit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples: [22,11,20,13,41]; recent concluded orders all show actual lead time 0. No evidence of lost shipments or regime shift (ending inventory positive but demand variability present). Promised lead time 0 is confirmed, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent observed demand (Periods 1-6 conclude) is much higher than the seed 5-sample series \u2014 recent weekly demands: 60,77,98,89,50,42. On-hand=7, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded periods. To reflect the recent demand regime I use recent_N=6 for demand mean and variance (captures all concluded selling periods). This keeps (1+L)\xd7mean responsive to the current higher-demand regime while using observed lead time via calculate so the OR backend sizes orders to meet (L+1) period demand and balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (P1\u2192P1, P2\u2192P2,...P7\u2192P7). Demand has clearly shifted upward vs. the Jan samples: last 7 concluded period demands = [60,77,98,89,50,42,70], mean \u2248 69.43, sustained for 7 periods. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (recent_N, N=7) so the backend forecasts using the current higher-demand regime (1+L times mean of last 7). This keeps service high while avoiding excess inventory since holding cost equals profit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all show 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P8 arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 4\u20138 = 89,50,42,70,75) indicates a sustained higher/volatile regime versus the sparse Jan samples; I use a recent-window forecast to capture current demand. Set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the last 5 observed demands, which balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 vs $1).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20139) shows demand series: 60,77,98,89,50,42,70,75,52 (mean \u224868.1) and every concluded arrival indicates lead time=0. No evidence of lost shipments. To keep policy aligned with observed lead time and let the OR engine compute appropriate base-stock and variability, set L via observed average lead time and use default demand/volatility (allowing backend to use full-sample mean/std). This balances service (use confirmed L=0) vs holding cost by letting the backend compute safety stock from full-sample stats.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 -> no pipeline cover. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (confirmed earlier), so use calculate for L. Recent demand shows a higher, stable regime over the last 5 weeks (Periods 6-10 demands = 42,70,75,52,64; mean=60.6) so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect current demand level and volatility. This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period forecast centered on the recent mean (avoids diluting with older low-demand samples) and a recent-volatility estimate to balance service level vs holding cost.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, leveraging full history for stable forecast and letting the capped policy limit order size to control holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use calculate to reflect observed lead time. Demand history (Periods 1-12) shows variable weekly demand but no sustained regime change; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps forecasts stable while the confirmed 0-period lead time lets the OR engine target service with minimal extra pipeline and avoid excess holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed Pn arrived same period); therefore set L by calculating observed lead time average. Recent demand (Periods 1\u201313) averages ~68 units/week with substantial variability; to capture current regime I use recent_N over the last 13 demand observations for both mean and volatility. These parameters raise the (1+L)\xd7forecast to meet current high demand while sigma from recent data sets safety stock; this balances profit-driven service level against holding cost given Profit=Holding=$1/unit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). SKU 678342002 has on-hand=0 and in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead time=0 in all concluded periods), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history across conclude messages is the primary data source; no sustained changepoint or seasonal spike detected. Profit and holding cost are equal (q=0.5) so target service z*=0 and base_stock should follow the (1+L)\xd7mean demand estimate. I therefore select default methods so the OR engine computes L from the promised lead time and mu_hat/sigma_hat from all samples. This keeps orders aligned with long-run average demand while avoiding overreacting to short fluctuations or transient shortages (and handles missing pipeline = 0).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been high and stable (~57\u201391 units/week, recent mean ~80). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. Observed concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime (Periods 11\u201315 demand: 57,91,81,89,83) so the backend sizes base stock to recent demand levels and volatility while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand samples.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent realized weekly demand is high and volatile (many weeks in the 50\u2013100 range; latest demands: P12=91,P13=81,P14=89,P15=83,P16=98). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so orders must cover (1+L) periods of demand. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=0, so use promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, ensuring the base-stock aligns with long-run observed demand while letting the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent weekly demand has been consistently high (~55\u201398, typically 60\u201390) and on-hand + in-transit = 0 so we must replenish for current-period demand. Lead times historically observed in concluded history are all 0 \u2014 use observed average. To capture the recent demand regime (late Apr\u2013early Jun elevated demand), I use recent_N=7 (Periods 11\u201317) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility reflect the most recent behavior and avoid dilution by early-Jan low samples. This balances service (cover immediate high demand) against holding cost by focusing on recent demand estimates while keeping L at observed value 0.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed). Demand regime since Period 1 is much higher than the sparse Jan samples; recent periods (P1\u2013P18) show sustained high weekly demand (many weeks 50\u201398). I set L to default (promised 0) since concluded history confirms 0. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=18 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the full recent high-demand regime (captures current mean and avoids diluting with Jan lows). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=18 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices align orders to current demand while keeping safety stock tuned to observed variability, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1..18 orders arrived same period as ordered).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical early-sample mean (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) = 21.4/wk but recent demand (Periods 12\u201319, dates 2019-04-29..2019-06-17) averaged 83.0/wk, a sustained higher regime over 8 weeks. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed Periods 2 and 19 concludes). To react to the confirmed 0 lead time and recent higher demand, set L=default (use promised 0). For demand forecast use recent_N on the last 8 demand observations to capture the new regime (reduces understock risk). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters push the OR engine to raise base stock to serve higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: early-sample mean (2019-01-07..2019-02-04)=21.4/wk vs recent Periods 12\u201319 mean=83.0/wk (+287%), sustained for 8 periods.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 12 with recent-period mean \u224883 units/wk (Periods 12\u201319) and concluded lead times = 0 for all observed orders. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current and lead demand. I set L by calculating observed lead times (all 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 12\u201319 length=8) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 8 samples. I use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward the higher recent mean (improving service) while keeping L=0 to avoid over-stocking for phantom delays.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift: periods 12\u201321 have much higher weekly demand (~83/wk) vs early-sample mean 21.4/wk. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will reflect confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the new high-demand regime (covers the sustained high-demand window) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a higher base stock and accounts for recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding. This avoids being understocked after the clear, sustained uplift.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime (Periods 12\u201322 average \u224883\u2013107/wk with sustained spikes in P20\u2013P22). On-hand=11, in-transit=0, promised lead time 0 has been consistently confirmed. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent samples for demand mean/volatility while keeping lead time at the confirmed promised value. Chosen methods: L default to use promised (confirmed 0); mu_hat recent_N (N=8) to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 8 demand samples and reflect the elevated recent demand; sigma_hat recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise target base-stock to balance lost-sales risk against equal profit/holding costs.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment; promised lead time=0 and prior confirms (Periods 1..23) so use default L. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime beginning around Period 12 (carry-over note: Periods 12\u201319 mean\u224883/wk vs earlier mean\u224821.4). To capture the elevated demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data from the post-changepoint regime. Method choices: L=default to keep promised lead time=0; mu_hat=recent_N with N=12 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 12 samples (captures sustained high-demand regime); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters tell the OR backend to raise the base stock to meet the new higher demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock; ordering will be sized to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand given zero pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has shifted up and been sustained since Period 12\u201319 (avg \u224883/wk); latest weeks (Periods 20\u201324) show continued high demand including a 145 spike. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand plus lead. I set L=calculate to use the observed lead-time history (all concluded arrivals show 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the confirmed higher regime (Period 12\u201319 regime length=8) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices keep the OR base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while using recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (confirmed P1 and P19). A sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 20 (recent higher-demand regime from P20 onward; regime length P20\u2013P25 = 6). To capture the elevated recent demand while trusting the confirmed same-day arrivals, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (captures the 6-period high-demand regime) so the OR backend computes base_stock using the recent higher mean and volatility\u2014this raises service targets to avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost by focusing on the recent regime instead of older low-demand samples.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting around Period 12 with much higher weekly demand; recent weeks (Periods 19\u201326) remain elevated. Set L to default (promised=0). For demand, use recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (uses last 8 samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the new higher-demand regime while avoiding dilution by much older low-demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand shifted up starting Period 20 and the higher-demand regime has persisted; I anchor forecasts on the recent regime. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (the recent 8-period high-demand regime, Periods 20\u201327) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the current sustained regime, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 12 (Periods 12\u201319 mean=83/wk) and all concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. Current on-hand=18, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 12\u201319) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 8 samples, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the new higher mean while keeping safety stock sized to recent variability, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show sustained higher demand since Period 12 (recent weeks mostly 70\u2013145 units). Lead time has been empirically 0 in concluded history. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect confirmed observed lead time (avg of concluded lead times \u22480). To capture the persistent higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 18 demand samples, balancing service (avoid stockouts in this higher-demand regime) against holding cost given profit=holding. This keeps orders responsive to the new demand level without over-weighting older low-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed P1 and P19) and a sustained demand regime shift to higher demand beginning around Period 12\u201320 (noted previously). No missing shipments observed. To prioritize recent higher-demand behavior I set L to default (use promised 0) and use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime (captures recent mean/variance while keeping responsiveness). This balances service (using recent high mean) against holding cost by keeping horizon short and volatility estimated from the same recent window.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=46, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue or missing shipments observed (lead time has consistently been 0). I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) given repeated confirmations. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L); this leverages the confirmed zero lead time and long recent demand history to produce a base-stock that balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) versus holding costs without overreacting to short-term noise.

Historical concludes show stable same-day arrivals (lead time = 0) and a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning Period 12\u201320 (recent higher mean). I set L to default (promised 0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. To capture the recent high-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (covering the most recent sustained high-demand periods) so the OR engine sizes base stock to current elevated demand and reflects recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost by limiting N to the recent regime rather than all historical low-demand samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent on-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time 0. Demand previously shifted up around Period 20 (carry-over). More recently (Periods 26\u201333) demand softened: sample demands = [97,47,86,76,47,44,28,43], recent mean \u224858.5/week versus earlier elevated levels. No overdue shipments. To reflect confirmed same-period arrivals set L to calculated (uses observed lead times). To capture the recent downshift I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (the recent regime length) so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5). This reduces excess inventory while preserving service for current demand regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0; use promised lead time (default). Demand has downshifted since late summer (lower weekly sales in Periods 27\u201336); to capture the recent lower regime I set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 10 demand samples (focuses the (1+L) forecast on the most recent pattern). Volatility also set to recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices reduce overstock risk while preserving service given current low pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen from the mid-summer peak; last 8 concluded weekly demands (P30\u2013P37) = [47,44,28,43,52,33,27,32], showing a lower recent regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history; use calculate to let backend confirm. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent 8-week regime to capture current lower mean/volatility and avoid overstock given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time repeatedly confirms 0. Demand has shifted since early samples; recent 8 periods (Periods 31-38) show lower, stabilized demand (~37.6/wk). I choose L=default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to reflect the most recent demand regime and avoid overweighting early low-sample data or earlier high spike period. This biases the base-stock toward recent demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (consistent through Period 39). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 20 and that higher regime persisted; use recent regime data for forecasts. Set L to promised (default) = 0. For demand scale and volatility use recent_N with N=20 (regime from P20\u2013P39, 20 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained post-shift demand. This keeps base-stock tied directly to the recent higher-demand mean while sigma captures recent variability; with profit=holding the backend targets q=0.5 (z*=0), so mu_hat chiefly determines the target level. Low on-hand and zero pipeline means orders will be needed to meet current-period demand after decision.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen from the mid-summer spike; last 8 demand observations (Periods 33\u201340) = [43,52,33,27,32,42,36,10], mean \u224834.4/wk. No new sustained lead-time signal (previously confirmed L=0). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the recent lower-demand regime (N=8 is the regime length used from the most recent consistent period), so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from those 8 samples. This keeps target stock aligned with current demand while avoiding excess holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows stable same-period lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 12\u201319 confirmed earlier. Current on-hand=41, in-transit=0; no arrivals scheduled. To balance service vs holding cost with profit=holding=$1, use the promised lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend computes the base-stock targeting the cost-optimal service level. Methods chosen: L=default to rely on confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat=default to let backend use full-sample mean scaled by (1+L); sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample volatility (sqrt(1+L) factor). This keeps parameter inputs conservative given zero pipeline and avoids overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show same-period arrivals; actual lead time sustained at 0. Recent demand has trended lower versus the mid-year peak; use the most recent 7 weekly samples to capture current regime (Periods 36\u201342 demands = 27,32,42,36,10,18,33). Set L by calculating average observed lead times (confirms 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect current lower-variance demand and avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5 implies moderate service target). This balances service vs holding by sizing base_stock to recent realized demand rather than the high mid-year peak.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historic lead time consistently observed = 0. Recent demand (Periods 36\u201343 = 33,32,42,36,10,18,33,14) shows a clear downward regime versus mid-year peak; most recent 8 weeks average = 27.25/wk. With profit=holding, z*=0 so base_stock equals mu_hat; using a recent-N estimate captures the recent lower demand and avoids overstock. Set L to promised (default). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm consistent lead time 0. Recent demand (Periods 40\u201344 = 10,18,33,14,12) is substantially below the earlier high regime (Periods 12\u201319 mean=83), indicating a new low-demand regime over the last 5 weeks. To target the current low-demand regime and avoid excess holding (profit=holding \u2192 q=0.5, z=0 so base_stock = mu_hat), I use promised lead time (default) and recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sets base_stock to the 5-week mean and volatility to recent volatility. This balances service level against holding cost given the December demand dip and zero in-transit inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (many periods). Demand has fallen in recent weeks (Periods 40\u201345: demands = [10,18,33,14,12,18], avg \u224817.5/week) compared with the earlier high regime (Periods 12\u201319 mean \u224883). I therefore keep L as default (promised=0, confirmed). For forecasting I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the new low-demand regime (N=6 covering Periods 40\u201345). I also use recent-N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and holding risk given low recent demand and zero lead time while keeping pipeline responsive to any reversal.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 40\u201345 avg=17.5/wk vs prior high regime (Periods 12\u201319) avg=83.0/wk (\u221279%), sustained for 6 periods.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent demand has settled into the low regime confirmed in carry-over (Periods 40\u201346 avg \u224817.5/wk). Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 0. To keep service while avoiding holding, set L to default (promised=0). Use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 40\u201346, length=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower mean and reduced variability. This reduces excess inventory given current low demand and equal profit/holding (q=0.5).
