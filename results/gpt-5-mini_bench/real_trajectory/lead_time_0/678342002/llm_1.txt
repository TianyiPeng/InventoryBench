Product: basic fitted cotton T-shirt \u2014 staple item with modest, stable demand. Historical demand (weekly): 2019-01-07:22; 01-14:11; 01-21:20; 01-28:13; 02-04:41. Sample mean \u224821.4 but last week shows a one-off spike to 41; no 3+ period sustained regime change. Lead time: supplier promised 0 but no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time unknown; cannot assume reliable same-period arrival. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Cost tradeoff: profit per unit = $1, holding cost = $1 per unit/period \u2192 high penalty for overstock; better to lean conservative and meet expected demand rather than fully cover the spike. Forecast for next week set near recent average \u224821. Place an order to cover expected demand (~21\u201322) while avoiding costly overstock.
