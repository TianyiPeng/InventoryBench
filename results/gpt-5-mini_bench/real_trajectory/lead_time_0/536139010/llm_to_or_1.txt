Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent observed demand samples: 47,63,69,60,61 (weekly). Period 1 demand observed = 47. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so immediate stockout risk exists this period. No concluded arrivals or observed lead-times yet, so use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. I select L=default to rely on promised lead time (no evidence to adjust). I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, providing a balanced base-stock forecast given equal profit and holding costs; this avoids overreacting to a single low week while enabling the backend cap to limit order size.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand samples (historical weeks) average ~60 units/week. On-hand=19, in-transit=0; Period 1 order (60) arrived same period (observed lead_time=0). I use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps target base-stock near historical mean (balances profit=holding cost equal, so service versus holding tradeoff handled by OR engine).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand samples mean=60 (samples: 47,63,69,60,61). Concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 for orders placed in Periods 1 and 2. Current inventory: on-hand=7, in-transit=0; recent demand consumed arrivals (sold 41 then 50). Given observed lead time=0 and no evidence of delays or regime change, use default lead time and default demand moments so base-stock centers on long-run sample mean (balances service vs holding since profit=holding).

Daily Reward (R_t): $56.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive periods with actual lead_time=0 (orders placed in P1-P3 arrived same period) and demand in those periods = 41, 50, 62, which is ~15% below the longer-run sample mean (60). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the coming demand. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=0 from concluded periods. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower-demand regime (uses P1-P3 concluded demands) so the OR backend targets a lower base-stock and reduces holding cost exposure while maintaining service given the current observed pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: recent avg demand = 51 (P1-P3) vs historical mean = 60 (Jan samples), ~-15% decline

Daily Reward (R_t): $51.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent realized demand has declined versus historical Jan samples: Periods 1-3 avg = 51 vs historical mean = 60 (~-15%). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand only. Observed concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 in prior periods. To reflect the recent lower demand regime I set L to the calculated (observed) lead time and use a recent_N forecast (last 3 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a lower base-stock and reduced cap, avoiding excess holding given profit=holding. This balances service with holding cost under the new lower-demand evidence.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent realized demand (P3-P5 = 62,51,53) averages ~55, below historical mean 60 and consistent with earlier noted downshift. On-hand=5, in-transit=0; lead time has been observed as 0 in all concluded periods. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent lower demand regime (keeps orders conservative vs historical mean). Volatility also from recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability. These settings limit overstock given equal profit and holding costs ($1/$1) while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $7.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent weekly demand has fallen vs earlier Jan samples: last three concluded demands = 60, 53, 33 (Periods 4-6). On-hand=26, in-transit=0, so coverage is limited versus recent demand. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so use default promised L. To react to the recent lower-demand regime while keeping service, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (captures the recent decline and lower volatility) so the OR backend reduces ordering vs the long-run Jan mean and avoids excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 4-6: avg recent demand = 48.7 (Periods 4-6) vs historical Jan mean = 60 (~-18.8% decline)

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded demands (Periods 5-7) = [53,33,43], recent mean = 43 units. On-hand=6, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. All concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period). To respond to the recent downward demand regime, set L via calculated observed lead times (0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (mean 43 over last 3 concluded periods), balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost ($1 each).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals visible; all concluded periods show actual lead_time=0 consistently. Recent demand (Periods 6-8 = 33,43,49) indicates a lower demand regime vs historical Jan mean (~60). To reflect the recent downward shift and give the OR engine a short-term forecast, set L to the observed average lead time and use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility (captures the most recent regime of 3 periods). This balances service (cover immediate demand) while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised lead time (default). Recent demand has fallen vs Jan historical; use the last 5 periods to estimate demand (Periods 5\u20139 mean=44.2) so the OR backend sets base_stock to the recent demand. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This adapts quickly to the lower regime and, with profit=holding (q=0.5 => z*=0), keeps base_stock = mu_hat to balance service and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 5-9 avg demand = 44.2 vs historical Jan mean = 60 (\u2248 -26.3%)

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has shifted down vs historical Jan mean (carry-over shows confirmed drop to ~44.2). On-hand=3, in-transit=0 -> very low available stock vs expected one-period demand. All concluded orders show lead_time=0 historically. I set L to 'calculate' so backend confirms observed lead time=0. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower regime (use last 5 demand observations rather than the older Jan samples). Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base_stock relative to historical mean, avoiding excess holding cost while meeting the lower current demand level.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2192 keep promised lead time. Recent demand has settled below historical Jan mean; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 7-11 = 43,49,43,42,39) average \u224843.2, so I use a recent_N forecast to adapt to the lower regime. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect volatility in the same window. These parameters reduce overstock risk while preserving service given low pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand remains well below historical Jan mean: latest demand=47; no on-hand or in-transit stock (risk of stockout). All concluded orders show actual lead time = 0 historically. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) since observed lead times are consistently 0. Demand appears in a new lower regime spanning Periods 5-12 (avg ~43.5); to capture this sustained shift I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (the regime length) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variance from the most recent 8 samples. This reduces overstock risk vs using the older Jan mean while keeping service given zero pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed continuing through Periods 5-12: avg demand = 43.5 vs historical Jan mean = 60 (\u2248 -27.5%)

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent periods show a sustained lower demand regime vs historical Jan mean (carry-over insights already recorded through Period 13). On-hand=4, in-transit=0 so current availability low; expect current-period demand after decision. Actual lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history (orders placed each period arrived same period). I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). To reflect the confirmed lower recent demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N on the most recent 9 periods (Periods 5-13) to base the (1+L)*mean on current demand; similarly set sigma_hat using recent_N N=9 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce ordering toward the lowered demand regime while the OR backend will compute service level via profit/(profit+holding) and cap orders to limit overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). Recent demand has shown a sustained downward regime vs. historical Jan mean (multiple periods P5\u2013P14 averaging ~43\u201344 vs historical 60). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). I keep lead time at promised value (0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (regime length P5\u2013P12 \u22488 weeks) so mu_hat reflects the reduced recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding given falling demand while retaining service by using recent observed mean/volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical Jan mean=60; recent periods show a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 5 (carry-overs recorded). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (regime from Periods 5\u201315, length=11) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 11 samples to capture the lower recent average; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices lower target base-stock to reduce holding costs while maintaining service for the confirmed lower-demand regime.

Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so set L by calculating average observed lead times. To capture the recent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match lower demand while preserving service versus holding cost tradeoff.

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. To avoid overstock while maintaining service in this lower-demand regime, use promised lead time (default) and compute demand forecast and volatility from the recent regime (use recent_N with N=14, covering Periods 5-18) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the persistent ~27% demand decline versus historical Jan levels. This keeps base-stock aligned to current demand and reduces holding cost risk given Profit=Holding cost.

Promised lead time=0 and all concluded orders show actual lead_time=0 historically, so use default L. To reflect confirmed downward demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures most recent demand level and volatility) so the OR backend targets a lower base-stock and reduces holding cost risk while maintaining service.

Historical Jan mean ~60 but demand has shown a sustained downshift since Periods 5-12 and continuing through recent weeks (carry-over insights report ~-25% demand vs Jan). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 consistently. To avoid excess holding given Profit=Holding= $1/unit, I use promised lead time (default). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the sustained lower recent demand and recent volatility (focus on the latest 8 periods to capture the shifted regime), so the OR engine computes base_stock over (1+L) periods using recent demand stats rather than the historical January mean.

To avoid excess holding and match current lower regime, set lead time to default (promised 0, historically observed 0) and use recent_N with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent 9 periods (P13\u2013P21).

Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded orders show actual lead time=0 historically, so keep L as default. To reflect the persistent lower recent demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent sustained regime (~Periods 5 onward). I choose recent_N with N=18 (captures Periods 5\u201322 demand signal) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean_recent and sqrt(1+L)*std_recent, which will reduce target base-stock and cap orders to avoid excess holding given profit=holding (q=0.5).

Demand has been in a lower regime vs Jan baseline (carry-over notes through Period 13). Recent 10 weeks (Periods 14-23) show variable but overall subdued demand; I use a recent_N forecast to capture the current lower regime while smoothing recent spikes. Keep L at promised (default=0) since observed lead_time=0 throughout history. Using recent_N N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances responsiveness to recent declines and volatility from a few higher weeks.

Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical samples (Jan) had mean\u224860 but demand has exhibited a sustained downshift since Periods 5\u201312 and continued through recent weeks (many periods with weekly demand mostly in the 20\u201345 range). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To avoid overstock given Profit=Holding ($1) and persistent lower demand, use promised lead time (default) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on recent data (last 20 weeks) so the OR engine targets lower base stock consistent with the new regime and reduces holding cost risk.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period; no overdue shipments. Recent demand has been well below the Jan baseline for many weeks, so I keep L as promised (default=0) because observed lead time remains 0. To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime I let the backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all available samples (default methods) so the estimate uses the full history while respecting L. This keeps the base-stock anchored to observed lower average demand while the cap limits order size to avoid excess holdings given equal profit/holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime confirmed continuing through Periods 5-25: avg demand (P5-P25)=~39 units vs historical Jan mean=60 (\u2248 -35% decline)

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently, so use promised lead time. Demand has exhibited a sustained downshift from Jan mean (~60) to a lower regime since Period 5 (P5-P25 avg \u224839). To reflect the recent lower regime I set demand estimates using the most recent 20 periods to capture the sustained lower demand and recent variability. This keeps base-stock and caps aligned to current demand while avoiding overstock given equal profit and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/08/19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders from Periods 1\u201327 arrived same period). Demand has exhibited a sustained downward regime since Period 5 (P5\u2013P25 avg \u224839, confirmed through Period 26). To protect service while limiting holding cost I keep promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime. I request mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from the most recent regime sample (use recent_N with N=20 to capture P8\u2013P27-ish recent behavior while capping at 20). This focuses the base-stock on the lower recent demand and reduces overstock risk; sigma_hat recent_N captures volatility in the same window.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are 0 so promised lead time is reliable. Demand has shown a sustained downward regime (confirmed through Periods 5-25, avg ~39) so I bias forecasts to the recent low-demand regime. Set L to default (promised lead time=0). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat to capture the most recent 20-week demand regime and recent_N (N=20) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk while maintaining service for the lower current demand level.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical observations show a sustained demand regime decline (Periods 5-25 avg \u224839 vs historical Jan mean 60, \u2248-35%), so I forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Promised lead time has been 0 in all concluded periods, so keep L as default (promised). To align base-stock with the sustained lower demand and avoid excess holding (profit=holding so q=0.5 \u2192 target \u2248 mean), set demand forecast to the recent regime using recent_N with N=20 (captures most of the confirmed low-demand window). Use the same recent_N (N=20) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk while maintaining service under the confirmed lower-demand regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. Long-run demand regime showed a sustained decline (carry-over history) but recent 4 periods (P27-P30) are volatile with two large spikes (59,53) and two lower (30,59), suggesting increased short-term uncertainty. To balance service vs holding cost: keep promised lead time (default), and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets stocking that reflects the latest demand regime and variability.

Demand has exhibited a sustained downshift vs Jan historical mean; recent weeks more relevant. I set L=default (use promised lead time 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand level (Periods 27-31 mean \u224852.8) so the base-stock reflects current lower demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility including several high spikes; this balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical Jan mean=60 but sustained lower regime was recorded earlier; recent weeks (Periods 29-32) show elevated & volatile demand (30,59,63,66) so I prioritize very recent data to capture current demand swings. Use promised lead time (default=0) since concluded history shows lead_time=0 consistently. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to make the base-stock reflect the last five demand observations and to let the OR backend balance service level against holding cost under current higher short-term volatility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical long-run decline recorded in carry-over notes, but Period 33 showed a large spike (demand=113). All concluded orders show actual lead time=0 historically. To balance service vs holding cost, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks to react to the September spike while limiting overweighting of a single outlier. Thus use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 5 samples.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent 5 periods (P30-P34) show a clear demand uptick (59,63,66,113,67 \u2192 avg 73.6) after a long lower-demand regime (P5-P25 avg ~39). No overdue shipments observed. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (0) since concluded history shows consistent 0 LT. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (order target = (1+L)*mean of last 5 weeks). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility (including the 113 spike). This balances service (meet current surge) versus holding cost by basing forecast and safety on the most recent sustained regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 30-34: recent avg demand = 73.6 (P30-P34) vs prior recent avg \u224839 (P5-P25) \u2014 sustained 5 periods, indicating a new higher-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent weeks (Periods 30-35) show a sustained higher-demand regime: recent demands = [59,63,66,113,67,71] with a 5-period strong uptick starting around P30-P34. On-hand=3, in-transit=0 so available coverage is negligible; no overdue shipments observed. I choose L=default (promised lead time = 0, historically confirmed by concluded messages). To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (focus on the most recent 5 demand samples to raise the base-stock to current demand levels). Similarly set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility (includes the large spike at P33). These params will raise target base stock and safety stock to reduce stockouts during the confirmed higher-demand regime while the holding cost equals profit, so we avoid oversized inventory by limiting to recent data.

Recent demand increased starting around Periods 30-34 and has been sustained through Periods 30-36 (recent demands: P32-36 \u2248 66,113,67,71,69 \u2192 recent mean \u224877 units). All concluded lead-times have been 0 historically. To balance service vs holding (profit=holding \u2192 critical service balance q=0.5), I keep promised lead time and place forecasts from the recent high-demand regime: set L=default (use promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 30 (sustained higher weekly sales ~70s in P30-P37). On-hand=8, in-transit=0 and no arrivals expected this period. Actual observed lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use default promised lead time. To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent data from the new regime (recent_N) with N=8 (P30-P37) so base-stock reflects the higher mean; set sigma_hat to recent_N N=8 to reflect volatility in this regime. This increases target stock to avoid lost sales while sigma_hat informs safety stock; with profit=holding the service-level z*=0 so mu_hat drives orders while sigma_hat controls cap via backend.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a clear higher-demand regime starting around Periods 30-34 (sustained ~5+ periods) with elevated weekly demand (~60-75) vs earlier low regime (~39). Recent window (Periods 30-38) contains 9 samples and better reflects current demand. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in all past periods, so use default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture the new higher-demand regime; this increases target base-stock to meet service while sigma_hat from recent data sets safety stock. This balances profit (equal to holding cost) by raising service level only to the extent supported by recent volatility, avoiding excess holding from older low-demand periods.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand showed a regime lift starting around Period 30 with high weekly demand through Periods 30-38, then a drop to 35 in Period 39; on-hand=37, in-transit=0. Promised lead time historically observed as 0 in all concluded periods, so use default L to keep backend assumption. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime but capture the sharp drop in P39, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (Periods 35-39 avg demand \u224861.4) so the OR engine targets supply for the most recent demand level and recognizes current volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts if demand stays ~60s) against holding cost given on-hand=37 and profit=holding (q=0.5).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; recent demand elevated since Period 30 with mixed week-to-week volatility (P35-40 mean\u224861, high spread due to a 35 spike). No evidence of changed lead time (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To cover immediate (same-period) demand and reflect recent regime, use L=default (promised 0). Forecast mu_hat using recent_N on the last 6 periods to capture the current elevated regime while keeping responsiveness. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility for safety stock sizing.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead times = 0 consistently, so keep L=default. Recent demand shows mixed high weeks around Periods 30-38 then volatility (P39 low). To be responsive to the most recent regime while limiting holding risk, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures latest 5 demand observations). This yields a (1+L)-period demand forecast anchored to the newest data and a volatility estimate that reflects recent variability, helping the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. History shows consistent actual lead time=0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). Recent demand shows elevated levels since Period 35; last 5 demands (P38-P42) = [62,35,60,52,175] with mean ~76.8 driven by a one-period holiday spike (P42=175). To protect service through ongoing high-season uncertainty but avoid excessive holding cost if spike is transient, keep L at promised (default = 0) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock toward recent demand while reflecting short-run variance. This balances profit-driven service (profit=holding so q=0.5) against holding cost and addresses zero pipeline (we must order to cover (1+L) periods). No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has spiked (Periods 42-43: 175,132) following a high-demand Oct regime; recent 5-period average (P39-P43 demands = 35,60,52,175,132) = ~90.8. Promised lead time historically = 0 (all concluded orders show 0). To avoid stockouts during this apparent holiday spike while the backend uses (1+L)*mean, I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to reflect the elevated short-term mean and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to capture increased volatility. I keep L=default since observed concluded lead times remain 0. This biases orders up to protect service level during the current surge while sigma supports wider safety stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has spiked strongly in late Nov\u2013Dec (Periods 42-44: 175,132,131; Periods 39-44 show elevated levels). Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded orders show lead_time=0), so use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. To capture the current holiday spike I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (Periods 39-44) so the OR engine targets higher base-stock and reflects elevated mean and volatility for the review+lead period. This raises service probability during the confirmed seasonal peak while the capped order cap prevents extreme single-period overorders given holding cost parity.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed: Periods 42-44 avg demand = 146 units (175,132,131) \u2014 sustained spike in late Nov/early Dec.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent history shows a short but large seasonal spike in late Nov/Dec (Periods 42-44 avg ~146) with demand moderating in Period 45 (72). On-hand=26, in-transit=0; no delayed/lost shipments observed (all concluded lead_times = 0 historically). To prioritize service during the holiday tail while avoiding large post-season holding cost (profit = holding cost), I keep L at promised (default). I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to target the very recent demand regime (captures the elevated holiday demand but reacts quickly as demand falls). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) so the backend sizes safety proportionally to the short-run volatility of the last 3 weeks. This combination favors meeting immediate holiday demand while allowing quick reversion as demand normalizes, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand shows a large December peak (Periods 42-44) followed by a decline (Periods 45-46 = 72, 53). On-hand=59, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and historical base mean is ~60 (Jan samples). To capture the recent rapid decay after the holiday spike while still weighting recent high demand, I choose L=default (use promised 0). For mu_hat I use EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.5) so the forecast blends the large December spike with the recent falloff, avoiding overreaction to a single period. For sigma_hat use default to let the backend scale volatility from full sample history. This balances service during residual holiday demand against holding costs given current on-hand inventory.
