Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (72,81,87,104,149) yield mean=98.6 units/week and sample std\u224830.5. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet and on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full-sample statistics; this balances service (protects against observed variability) without overfitting to very few periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period1 order of 125 arrived same period (observed lead_time=0). Recent realized demand in Period1 was high (195) versus historical weekly mean ~98.6, but this is a single high observation \u2014 not yet a sustained regime shift. I therefore set lead time to be inferred from observed history (calculate) to capture confirmed 0-period arrivals, and use default demand stats (all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to avoid overreacting to one high week. This balances service (avoids stockouts driven by a single spike) against holding cost by letting the OR backend compute the base stock using full-sample mean/variance.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two high-demand weeks (demand 195, 179) plus 2019-02-04:149, indicating a sustained upward demand regime vs earlier samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and observed lead times in concluded history are 0 (orders placed arrived same period twice). I set L='calculate' to confirm lead time=0 from observations. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (samples: 149,195,179) because a changepoint toward higher demand is evident; this gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period forecast focused on the new regime and avoids diluting with older low-demand weeks. For volatility I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect current variability. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent mean while keeping sigma consistent so the backend balances service level (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-02-04: recent mean (149,195,179)=174.33 vs earlier sample mean (72,81,87,104,149)=98.6 (+77%); sustained high demand for 3 consecutive periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Last three concluded periods show arrivals with observed lead_time=0 (orders placed in P1/P2/P3 arrived in same period). Recent demand has run above historical baseline for 3 periods (consecutive high-demand regime noted in prior insight). To capture the confirmed short lead time and recent higher-demand regime, set L by averaging observed lead times; forecast demand using the most recent 3 periods to reflect the new regime, and estimate volatility from the same 3-period window. These parameters keep target base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while the short lead time limits pipeline risk and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $281.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=103, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders placed P1\u2013P4 arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has declined from the Feb peak: last 3 concluded demands = 179, 119, 96 (mean=131.33) \u2014 I treat this as the most relevant recent regime for the (review+lead) demand forecast. To capture current variability, use the same recent window for sigma. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the recent downward trend while reflecting short lead time and limiting excess holding costs.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has decelerated from the higher regime flagged earlier; last three concluded demands = 119, 96, 85 (mean \u2248100). On-hand=83, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=0 with historical confirmed arrivals at 0. To avoid overstock while preserving service, set L based on observed lead times (0). Use a short recent_N window (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the recent downshift in demand and keep orders responsive; this keeps the backend base-stock low given holding cost >0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent observed lead times in concluded periods 1-6 are all 0, so set L by calculating observed average. On-hand=14, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand has moderated from the earlier spike: most recent demands (Periods 4-6 = 96,85,101) indicate a lower regime than the earlier high sample. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus the (1+L) forecast on the latest 3 weeks (captures current lower demand). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters reduce ordering to avoid excess holding cost while covering near-term demand.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has been elevated and more volatile (notably a 211 sale in the most recent concluded period). All observed lead times in concluded history are 0, so use promised lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and current volatility, use recent_N over the last 7 concluded demand observations (covers the sustained regime since early Feb). These parameters prioritize service (reduce stockouts during high recent demand) while sigma_hat recent_N captures higher variability to size safety stock appropriately.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (last demands: 96,85,101,211,144), with a prior confirmed regime shift earlier in Feb. On-hand=41, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically observed = 0. I keep L as default (promised=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated/volatile regime using the most recent 5 periods, and match sigma_hat to the same recent window to reflect current variability. These choices steer the OR base-stock toward recent realized demand while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend service-level cap.

Observed lead times in history all =0, so keep promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to adapt to the recent mixed/high-demand regime (captures recent mean and volatility). This raises the base-stock to protect service level against the recent demand spike while keeping holding cost awareness via the backend cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use promised/default L. A sustained demand regime shift was detected beginning 2019-02-04 (recorded previously). To capture the elevated recent demand profile I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the full recent regime (11 most recent concluded samples from 2019-02-04 through 2019-04-15). This keeps (1+L) scaling consistent while reflecting higher recent mean and variance, supporting higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while controlling holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period (promised L=0) arrivals; no evidence of lost shipments. Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-02-04 (carry-over insight already recorded). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised lead time (default) and recent demand to capture the current regime. I select recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the most recent demand pattern (stable higher mean) while keeping variability estimate responsive.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since early Feb (carry-over noted), so I bias forecasts to the recent regime. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand behavior (reduces influence of earlier low-demand samples) so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while controlling variability estimate via recent volatility.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning 2019-02-04 (higher mean vs earlier). On-hand=5, in-transit=0 \u2014 low coverage vs recent demand (last few weeks 130,132,130 etc.). Use promised lead time (default L=0) because all concluded lead times are 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=11) to capture the sustained post-2019-02-04 regime (regime length = 11 periods from Period 3\u201313); this biases mu_hat upward to cover (1+L) review+lead demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=11) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to raise the base-stock for the new higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock aligned to recent variability, improving service with controlled holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 in all observed arrivals so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been in a higher regime; use recent_N=7 (last 7 weeks: P8-P14) to capture current mean/volatility (~114.6 mean) so the OR engine sets base-stock to target current demand while limiting excess holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every observed lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P15 arrived same period), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P11\u2013P15) = [89,132,130,106,110], mean=113.4. Demand rose earlier (captured in prior carry-over insight) and recent 5-week mean better reflects current regime and recent volatility. Set L via calculate (average observed lead times = 0) and use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent std, reducing stockouts while limiting holding given moderate current on-hand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows sustained elevated weekly demand since early Feb with no evidence of lead-time slips\u2014every concluded order arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 consistently). On-hand=29, in-transit=0; upcoming demand will occur after this decision, so maintain safety via backend base-stock. I choose default lead time to trust promised L=0 and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses full sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (use all historical data including confirmed higher regime) against holding cost given moderate on-hand stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

To react to the recent lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding while preserving service, I use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 weeks to capture current demand level/volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has trended down from the spring spike; on-hand=69, in-transit=0 so we have modest cover today. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2014 use promised/default lead time. To adapt to the recent lower-but-volatile weeks, use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and volatility (captures last 5 weeks: P14-P18) so the base-stock reflects current demand while limiting excess holding cost. This balances service (responsive to recent demand) vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. A demand regime shift was previously detected starting 2019-02-04 and has persisted through recent periods (sustained higher sales). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. I keep L at default (promised = 0) since concluded history confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N over the sustained high-demand regime to capture the new mean/volatility: N=17 (regime length from Period 3 through Period 19). This sets mu_hat to (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 17 samples and sigma_hat to sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the last 17 samples, which informs the OR backend to raise target base-stock for the sustained higher demand while balancing holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=109, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in previous periods have always arrived same-period), so keep L = promised (default). Recent demand has dropped versus spring (last 5 concluded demands: 100,79,52,56,29) indicating a summer slowdown; use a recent_N forecast to capture the lower current mean and lower volatility. Selected mu_hat: recent_N N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 5 periods. Selected sigma_hat: recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices shrink target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. Recent demand has fallen vs earlier 2019 spike: last 5 concluded demands = [79,52,56,29,32], recent mean ~49.6. On-hand=77, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Historical observed lead times have been 0 consistently. I set L using recent observed lead times (calculate) confirming 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent lower-demand regime; same for sigma to reflect reduced volatility. This keeps base_stock tuned to current lower demand (reduces holding cost) while preserving service for near-term demand given no in-transit stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. On-hand=38, in-transit=0; recent demand has fallen sharply (Periods 20-22: 29,32,39). All concluded lead times = 0 historically, so keep promised lead time. To react to the recent low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 weeks (N=3) to capture current demand level/volatility; keep L=default so backend uses promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 20: recent mean (P20-P22) = (29,32,39) = 33.33 vs prior Periods 1-19 mean \u2248 115.0 (\u221271%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): recent demand has dropped sharply since Period 20 (demands 29,32,39,37) vs prior long-run average ~115. On-hand=1, in-transit=0 so little coverage. No concluded late arrivals; historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently. I therefore keep L=default (promised 0). To respond to the sustained low-demand regime I set mu_hat by recent_N using the last 4 periods (N=4) to capture the new lower mean and reduce overstock risk. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=4 to reflect reduced volatility in the recent regime. These choices lower the base-stock and cap, reducing ordering when demand is persistently low and thus balancing service level against holding costs given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 20: demands P20-P24 = [29,32,39,37,30], recent mean \u2248 33.4 vs prior mean \u2248115. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting immediate demand, keep promised lead time (L default=0) and set demand forecast to the recent regime. Selected mu_hat recent_N with N=5 (covers P20\u2013P24 regime) and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect current lower mean and volatility. This biases orders toward lower base_stock to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost under the new low-demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has settled into the low-demand regime that began at Period 20 (weekly demands P20-P25 = 29,32,39,37,30,29). On-hand=9, in-transit=0 so available stock is low relative to upcoming weeks. I set L to default (promised 0) because all concluded lead times have been 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained low-demand regime since Period 20 (regime length=6), so the OR backend will size base stock and cap using recent mean and variability rather than the much larger historical mean.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical lead times observed are consistently 0; no late/lost shipments visible. Demand shows a sustained lower regime starting around Period 20 (P20-P26 mostly low: 29,32,39,30,29,37/stockout), so I use recent data to forecast. Set L=default to trust promised lead time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (regime length \u2248 7 weeks of low demand) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 7 samples, which prioritizes service for the current lower-demand regime while controlling holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has risen over the last 4 concluded periods (P24-P27 demands = 30,29,74,75) versus the prior low regime (P20-P23 mean \u224833). To react to the recent uptick while relying on the promised lead time, I use promised/default lead time and short-window recent demand estimates (capture the last 4 periods) so the OR engine sets base stock to reflect current higher demand but keeps volatility tied to recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts after several zero on-hand periods) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand increased markedly in the last 3 weeks (Period 26-28: 74,75,85). I set L=default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded arrivals show 0 lead time. To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility (responsive to the latest spike) and avoids over-retaining inventory from older high-variance history.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: recent mean (P26-P28) = (74,75,85) = 78.0 vs prior Period 20-25 mean \u2248 43.5 (+79%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been volatile: P27-29 demands = (75,85,45) showing a drop in P29 after two high weeks. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded lead_times = 0). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the latest short-term regime (reflecting the sharp fall in P29) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples; sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 3 samples. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent drop while limiting overstock given holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders in concludes always arrived same period). Demand has been higher recently vs mid-year lows; I detect a recent regime from Period 26 onward (periods 26-30) so I base forecast on the last 5 samples to capture current level while limiting influence of older low-demand periods. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (supported by concluded history). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 (captures P26-P30 demand pattern). This balances service (use recent demand) against holding cost by avoiding over-forecasting from older high peaks.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period (no evidence of delays), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand has risen since late July; last 3 concluded demands (Periods 29-31) = 45, 58, 86 (avg=63). I detect a recent upward regime relative to the low-summer trough, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples to capture current demand level and volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher recent demand while leveraging L=0 to avoid extra pipeline buffer and limit holding cost.

To be responsive to the latest three weeks' demand I set L=default (promised 0), mu_hat as recent_N with N=3 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent regime, and sigma_hat as recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility and keep orders from overshooting inventory given holding cost >0.

Promised lead time historically observed as 0 (all concluded lead_times = 0). To prioritize service with minimal holding cost, I use the most recent regime (last 3 weeks) for demand forecasts: keep L = default (promised 0); set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to target (1+L)*recent mean and capture the current demand level; set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility and produce an appropriate safety stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been lower than mid-year peaks but elevated vs deep-summer lows: last 3 concluded demands (P33-P35) = [101, 80, 73], recent mean \u224884.7. Historical lead times consistently observed = 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time 0). To prioritize service with minimal holding cost given short lead time, I use L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current regime (short-run mean \u224884.7 over review+lead period). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability and avoid inflating safety stock from older regimes. These settings give the OR backend a focused short-term forecast and tighter safety buffer appropriate when lead time is reliably 0 and recent demand is the best predictor.

=== Period 36 Summary ===
399256018: ordered=77, arrived=77 units (ordered on Period 36, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=97, demand=71, sold=71, ending on-hand inventory=26

Daily Reward (R_t): $258.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 every period (no delayed/lost shipments). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) is stable (~70\u201386, recent mean \u224875). To target current regime and avoid excess holding, set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility. This captures the latest demand level while keeping safety stock modest given Profit=$4 / Holding=$1 (high service quantile). No evidence of new sustained changepoint or missing shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=6, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals in concluded history. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep L=default (promised 0). Recent demand (last 3 concluded periods P35-P37) = [73,71,84], indicating a moderate recent mean \u224876; I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to this short-term regime while keeping responsiveness and limiting holding cost given low on-hand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been stable over the last 3 periods (Periods 36-38 \u2248 71,84,69). Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). I set L=default to use promised lead time. To capture the recent demand regime and keep responsiveness to the latest sales, I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 3 samples. This balances service (using recent higher/lower demand) against holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical lead times have consistently concluded as 0 periods (orders in history always arrived same period), so keep L as default (promised lead time=0). Recent demand has settled lower than some earlier peaks; last 5 concluded demands (P35-P39) = [73,77,64,76,69?] \u2014 (observed running demand recently \u2248 70\u201385 with some variability). To focus the forecast on the current regime and avoid overstock, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from latest demand mean and volatility. This balances service (capture current demand) versus holding cost given low on-hand and no in-transit units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has softened vs earlier high-volatility months; to capture the latest regime while retaining enough samples I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (captures latest 5 demands to adapt to downward trend). This balances service level (by reflecting recent lower mean) against holding cost to avoid excess stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 39-41) = [63,49,61], recent mean \u224857.7; no evidence shipments are delayed (all concluded lead_time=0 historically). Given proximity to Black Friday (possible spike) but only 3 recent samples showing modest demand, I use a short recent-window forecast to reflect current lower demand while keeping lead time as promised. Set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent demand regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias ordering toward the recent observed demand (reducing holding cost risk) while preserving service given low pipeline inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0; recent demand includes a one-period spike (Period 42=114) likely seasonal (late-Nov) but not a sustained 3+ period shift. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance (conservative vs. noisy recent spike) to balance service level and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 41-43 = 61,114,48) shows elevated volatility with a holiday-period spike at P42 but no sustained new regime beyond 3 periods. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N N=3 to capture the most recent demand level including the holiday spike while avoiding dilution by much older regimes. I use default sigma_hat so backend computes volatility from full sample history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (capture recent higher demand) against holding cost given current inventory of 75 and zero pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=63, in-transit=0. No lost shipments; historical actual lead time consistently 0. Recent demand has moderated (Periods 40-44 demand = 49,61,114,48,47) \u2014 a spike at P42 (114) appears transient. To be responsive to recent demand but avoid overreacting to the single large spike, use a short recent window (N=5) for mu_hat so the forecast reflects the latest mix of moderate demand and the transient spike. Keep L as default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Use default sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (profit>holding favors higher service level) while avoiding excessive holding from reacting only to the one large outlier.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 41-45) shows moderate weekly demand (~61,114,48,47,49) with the large 114 as an isolated spike (holiday/outlier). Promised lead time historically observed = 0; no evidence of lost shipments. To balance service vs holding cost approaching end-of-year, use a short, recent demand estimate: set L=default (promised 0) so orders would arrive same period; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand level while smoothing the spike; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to current lower demand while tolerating recent variability and avoids excess holding during seasonally slower weeks.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Recent demand returned to ~50/week after a one-off spike (Period 42=114). Given current post-peak holiday timing and sustained ~4 weeks of ~40-50 demand, I use a recent_N demand estimate focused on the last 4 periods to avoid the single spike. Keep lead time as default (promised 0). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base stock responsive to the lower recent demand and avoids excess holding costs while preserving service.
