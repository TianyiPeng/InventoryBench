{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows lead time = 0 (P1\u2013P45 arrivals all same-period). Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 86, in-transit = 0. Recent realized weekly demand has been ~45\u201365 units (Periods 41\u201345: 61,114*,48,47,49; excluding the stockout-driven spike in P42, typical recent demand \u224848\u201361). OR recommends 34 units based on historical averaging, but with LT=0 any order would arrive this period and immediately increase ending inventory and holding cost. Given on-hand (86) comfortably exceeds expected single-period demand (~50) and holding cost = $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit, placing additional units now would raise holding costs more than expected incremental sales benefit. Strategy: place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while preserving ability to respond immediately next period (LT=0) if demand runs above expectation.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history (Periods 1\u201346) confirms actual lead time = 0 (all prior orders arrived same period). Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 45, in-transit = 0, recent demand has settled around ~46 units/week (Periods 43\u201346: 48,47,49,41 \u2192 mean \u224846). There was an isolated spike at Period 42 (114) but subsequent four weeks show the lower regime; carry-over insights already record these regime shifts. OR recommended 75 units using historical averages and promised lead time; with L=0 the review+lead horizon is one period so we should target on-hand+arrivals \u2248 expected single-period demand plus safety. Given confirmed L=0, a current expected demand \u224846 and modest variability, I target a small safety buffer rather than OR's larger restock to avoid excessive holding cost. Action decision: order 15 units so arrivals + on-hand = 60, which covers expected demand (~46) plus ~30% safety (~14) while limiting holding cost exposure. This balances profit loss from stockouts (profit=$4) against holding cost ($1) and reflects the recent lower-demand regime.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR's 75\u219215: confirmed lead time = 0 and recent demand \u224846/week, so topping up to 60 units (45 on-hand + 15 order) gives coverage for expected demand plus a modest safety buffer while avoiding unnecessary holding costs.",
