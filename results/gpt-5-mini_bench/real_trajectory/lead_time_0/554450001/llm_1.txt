Calendar: 2019-02-11 is early Feb (no major apparel-driving holiday this week).

Lead time: supplier promised 0 but no concluded arrivals yet; actual lead time unknown. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision logic: because profit per unit ($4) substantially exceeds per-period holding cost ($1), understocking (lost sales) is more costly than modest overstock. Given recent weekly demand ~220\u2013245 and the most recent at 245, I target meeting ~one week of demand plus a small safety buffer to cover variability and possible slight upward trend. I will order 250 units to serve Period 1 demand while keeping holding risk modest.",
