Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) mean ~91.6 units; no concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time shifts; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Use default lead time (promised 0) because no observed lead-time data. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service (cover expected weekly demand) against holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 vs $1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demands avg=91.6 (samples: 74,101,98,91,94). Period 1 conclude shows order placed P1 arrived P1 (lead_time=0). I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) = 0 evidence from P1. With L=0, use default demand estimates so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean_of_all_samples and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std_of_all_samples. This keeps forecasts aligned with historical weekly demand while honoring the confirmed same-period lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived same period (observed lead_time=0). Recent realized demand (106, 207) is well above historical sample mean (~91.6) but is only two periods\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained regime shift. To cautiously raise target inventory while not overreacting, keep L at promised/default (0) and use an EWMA forecast to weight recent high demand (gamma=0.5). Keep sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overfitting volatility from two large periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $154.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Observed concluded lead times = 0 for Periods 1-3 (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand shows a sustained upswing: Period1 demand=106 (2019-02-11), Period2=207 (2019-02-18), Period3=260 (2019-02-25) vs historical Jan mean=91.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus lead. I set L=default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time so far. Forecast (mu_hat) uses recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime ((106+207+260)/3=191) multiplied by (1+L)=1. Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect the higher variance in the recent regime. These parameters make the OR backend raise the base stock to meet the new demand level while sigma increases the safety-stock to balance service level against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (2019-02-11): recent avg demand (P1-P3)=191 vs prior Jan avg=91.6 (+109.4, +119%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent data show a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-02-11 (periods 1-4) with much higher weekly demand (~191 avg recent vs ~91 prior). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the new regime. Set L to calculate (observed lead times = 0 historically). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-mean, higher-variance regime (N=4 equals the confirmed regime length). This biases the OR base-stock toward serving the elevated demand while keeping holding costs responsive to the recent volatility.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 for Periods 1\u20135) and a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-02-11: recent weekly demands = [106,207,260,254,278] (mean=221). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover next (1+L) periods of demand. I set L to calculate (average observed lead times = 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (N=5 equals the 5-period recent regime). No overdue/lost shipments detected; parameters prioritize meeting high recent demand while holding cost equals profit, so using recent demand statistics keeps target base-stock aligned to current demand volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has shifted sharply up since 2019-02-11 and has been sustained through Period 6 (demands: 106,207,260,254,278,312). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the higher regime. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P6 arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the 6-period high-demand regime to capture current mean and volatility (N=6). This biases orders toward servicing the new higher demand while the backend base-stock formula will balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has shifted upward starting Period 1 (sustained through Period 7). Observed demands P1-P7 = [106,207,260,254,278,312,423], indicating a new higher-demand regime. Lead-time evidence: all concluded orders P1\u2013P7 arrived in the same period they were ordered. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm 0. For demand \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 I use recent_N with N=7 (regime length = 7) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent high-demand regime, balancing service vs holding cost under the confirmed short lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3, P4 arrived P4, P5 arrived P5, P6 arrived P6, P7 arrived P7)

LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show a sustained, higher-demand regime starting P1 (2019-02-11) with accelerating weekly demand (most recent 5 weeks: 254,278,312,423,609). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in multiple concluded periods. To capture the recent high and rising demand while keeping L consistent with observed arrivals, set L=default (promised=0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the latest regime (balances service vs holding cost by reflecting current demand level and recent variability).

Set L based on observed lead times (average=0). Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand across (1+L) periods using the current regime statistics.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Demand has been on a sustained higher regime since 2019-02-11 (10 post-shift weekly observations, mean demand \u2248331.3). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to cover (1+L) periods of demand. Promised lead time is 0 and past concludes confirm L=0; use default promised lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N over the 10 post-shift samples to capture the new steady high-demand regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 10). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=10 to reflect observed volatility in the same window. This biases the base-stock toward current realized demand while keeping safety stock consistent with recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been much higher than Jan baseline (sustained regime shift since 2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover next (1+L) periods. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I use L=default to keep promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (last 5 concluded demands: P7-P11) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock and cap using the elevated mean and observed volatility rather than the older low-demand samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 1 (carried over). All concluded orders/arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. To match the new, higher-demand regime I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures current weekly demand ~P8-P12), which helps the OR backend size base stock for the elevated demand while keeping variance estimation responsive.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 1 (recent avg much higher than prior Jan levels). To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N over the full recent regime (Periods 1\u201313) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current mean/volatility. L uses default (promised lead time = 0). This keeps the OR base-stock tied to the observed high-demand regime while avoiding understock from using older low-demand samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 1 (post-Jan) and lead time confirmed as 0. I keep L at promised (default) since arrivals have been same-period. To capture the elevated recent demand and recent volatility, I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 6 demand samples (Periods 9-14: 442,422,535,544,415,478). This biases the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N reflects recent variability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 1 (Feb 11) with much higher weekly demand; lead time repeatedly confirmed as 0. Inventory is effectively zero for covering upcoming demand. I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (use the most recent 5 weeks to reflect current mean/volatility and avoid dilution by the low-Jan samples). This biases orders toward higher coverage to avoid stockouts while the OR backend balances service vs holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand remains at the elevated regime (sustained high weekly sales since Feb). On-hand=107, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. Use L=default to trust promised 0. For demand, use recent_N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (most recent weeks show mean \u2248458 units/week). Use sigma recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility (std \u224862). These settings keep base_stock responsive to the newer, higher demand while reflecting recent variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=101, in-transit=0, promised LT=0 and historical concludes consistently show LT=0. Recent demand remains at a higher regime vs Jan. I set L=default to trust promised 0. I use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7forecast on the most recent 5 weeks (captures current elevated demand ~421 units/week). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=99, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P18) consistently show orders arriving same period => actual lead time confirmed 0. Recent demand has been higher than Jan baseline and then stabilized; no new sustained changepoint since last recorded insights. To keep OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full sample history, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (captures higher recent mean via all-sample average) versus holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period 1 with multiple concluded arrivals; actual lead time confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over. Current on-hand=12, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments. To keep service while avoiding extra holding cost, I use the promised lead time (0) and let the backend compute demand mean/volatility from all historical samples (default). This leverages the confirmed lead time=0 and the full sample history so the OR engine's base-stock and cap calculations balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent demand has settled well above the Jan baseline (carry-over notes a sustained regime shift early in the run). Current inventory: on-hand=102, in-transit=0 so no pending arrivals; promised lead time=0 and historical concluded arrivals confirm 0. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. Demand forecast uses recent_N (last 5 demand observations) because demand peaked then declined toward a new mid-300s\u2192200s level; using the most recent 5 weeks captures the current regime while limiting stale early-sample influence. Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to match volatility to the same recent window. These settings give the OR backend a short lead time and a forecast focused on the current demand regime, balancing service (avoiding stockouts) and holding cost given substantial on-hand stock.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=142, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods consistently. Profit and holding cost equal ($1/$1) so the backend's default base-stock calibration is appropriate using the full sample history. Use promised/default lead time and default demand moments so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding given equal profit/holding.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=168, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 for many periods; demand rose sharply in Feb\u2013Apr then moderated through June/July. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=$1, holding=$1 \u2192 q=0.5), I use an inferred lead time from observations and base demand on recent history to capture the post-spike regime. L set to calculated average observed lead time (reflects confirmed 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=20 to reflect the most recent 20 weeks of demand (captures the elevated regime and subsequent taper), so the OR backend computes base stock and cap using recent mean/volatility and the chosen L. This balances service level after the demand shift against high holding cost given current on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-02-11 (sustained elevated weekly demand vs Jan baseline). On-hand=251, in-transit=0 \u2014 coverage is moderate versus recent weekly demand but we should target the higher-demand regime when sizing the replenishment. Set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained post-change demand regime (use the last 20 weeks to estimate mean and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead period). This biases orders toward service for the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability and prevents over/under-stocking given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=270, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 \u2192 use promised (default). Recent demand has declined from earlier peaks; last 5 concluded demands (P20-P24) = [214,175,139,116,90], recent mean \u2248146.8. Profit=Holding \u2192 q=0.5 so z*=0; using a recent_N forecast (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the policy on the current lower-demand regime and reduces unnecessary holding while preserving service.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=189, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in concluded history). Recent demand has trended down from spring peaks; last 5 periods (P21-P25) show low, stable demand. Use promised lead time (default=0) to match observed 0. Forecast demand using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower regime (reduces overstock risk); estimate volatility with recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These settings balance service vs holding by sizing base stock to current lower demand while keeping safety buffer per observed recent volatility.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has fallen from spring peak to ~80s/week (last 3 demands: 90,81,76). On-hand=113, in-transit=0; with L=0 arrivals are same-period so current inventory covers ~1\u20131.5 weeks. I set L=default (promised 0, confirmed historically). I set mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture the new low-demand regime (uses mean of last 3 periods \u224882.33 \xd7 (1+L)). I set sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect reduced recent volatility. These choices reduce ordering to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service given the sustained 3-period drop in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 24 (2019-07-22): avg demand P24\u2013P26=82.33 vs prior spring avg ~359 (Periods 9\u201316), sustained 3 periods

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has dropped sharply starting Period 24 (P24\u2013P26 avg=82.33 vs prior spring avg ~359) and this low regime persisted for 3 periods (P24\u2013P26) and P27 demand=85, confirming the downshift. On-hand=28, in-transit=0; with lead time effectively 0 historically, arrivals are same-period so inventory must cover current demand. I set L=default (promised lead time=0, confirmed by many concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new low-demand regime (use last 3 periods' demand). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the new lower demand, avoiding excess holdings while maintaining service for current observed demand.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent data show a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 24 (P24\u2013P28 demand \u2248 [90,81,76,85,84] with recent sold ~80\u201390), and all observed lead times in history are 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for (1+L) periods of this lower-demand regime. I set L using recent_N to trust the consistent observed lead-time=0 (N=5). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to target the lower regime mean/volatility, which reduces overstock while maintaining service. This keeps base_stock tied to the current low-demand regime and limits holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand shows a sustained downshift beginning Period 24 (Jul 22) \u2014 latest 6 demands = [90,81,76,85,84,57], current on-hand=27, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded periods. To avoid overstocking given the new low-demand regime, I use a recent-window demand estimate (6 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock to the lower recent mean; I set L by calculation (observed average lead time = 0) so pipeline length is accurate. This balances service (cover (1+L) periods) against holding cost in a lower-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. Demand shifted down starting P24 and has remained at a lower regime through recent periods; recent 7-period window (P24\u2013P30) captures the post-shift demand profile. To avoid overstocking given profit=holding, use promised lead time (default) and base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime (recent_N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a lower base stock and tighter cap, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the current lower demand level.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized at a lower level over the last 3 weeks (Periods 29\u201331 demand = 57, 59, 72). Lead time has consistently been observed as 0 in concluded periods. I choose L=calculate to let the backend confirm observed lead time (will be 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new lower regime (most recent 3 samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock to recent demand and avoids overstock given equal profit/holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 29: avg demand P29\u2013P31=62.67 vs prior recent avg ~82.33 (Periods 24\u201326); sustained 3 periods (-24.0%)

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 30\u201332 = 59,72,62) is lower than earlier high-spring regime, so I use a short recent window to capture current demand level. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (and confirmed 0). Use mu_hat recent_N N=3 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples, and sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target inventory tight to avoid holding cost while meeting near-term demand.

Lead time history consistently 0. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (Periods 29\u201333) while smoothing the P33 spike. Sigma also set to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep orders responsive to the current lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Volatility also set from the same recent 5 samples. These choices keep orders responsive to the current lower-demand regime while preserving service vs. holding tradeoff.

To be responsive to the lower recent regime while respecting confirmed 0 lead time, I set L to use the promised/default (0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent stable regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent demand volatility. This keeps target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (P31\u2013P36 demand = 72,62,126,39,35,47) show lower, volatile demand versus earlier peaks; no new sustained regime change detected. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0, so keep L=default to match ops. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand level (captures current lower mean) and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility, which helps the OR backend set a smaller base stock while preserving short-term cushion.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2014 use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 24 with the most recent weeks (P29\u2013P37) stable at lower volumes; use recent_N to focus mu/sigma on the latest 9 weeks (Periods 29\u201337) so the OR backend targets appropriate base-stock for the current low-demand regime and avoids excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand has been lower than spring peaks (recent 5 demands = P34\u2013P38: 39,35,47,70,58); to adapt to the recent lower regime and avoid excess holding (holding cost = profit), I use promised lead time (default=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 samples to reflect current mean/volatility and reduce inventory buildup.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since Period 29 (~60 units/week); last 7 demands (P33\u2013P39) avg \u224862.3. Lead times have consistently concluded as 0 in history. To reflect the recent low-demand regime and short lead time, set L via observed average, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures the most recent low-demand behavior while meeting the N selection rules). This keeps the backend base-stock low to avoid holding costs while maintaining service for current demand variability.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has settled in the lower regime since Period 29 (~63 avg); on-hand=11, in-transit=0 so coverage is low vs (1+L)-period demand. Lead time history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. I therefore keep L = promised (0) but base demand forecast and volatility on the recent low-demand regime (Periods 29\u201341). I select recent_N with N=13 (regime length) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the current lower-demand level and avoids excess holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals \u2014 actual lead time confirmed as 0 (already recorded). Demand has been in the lower regime since late July with recent low weekly sales; to reflect current low-demand regime and reduce holding cost I set demand forecast using recent samples. Choose L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 weeks, improving responsiveness and avoiding overstating mean from earlier high-demand periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand shows mostly low weekly sales (~30\u201376) but a one-off spike at Period 42 (431) \u2014 not yet sustained. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). Use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to damp the single large spike while reflecting recent upticks. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility in the last 5 weeks.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows a large short-term spike (Periods 42\u201343) but otherwise moderate weekly demand. On-hand=66, in-transit=0, so current coverage is limited. Lead time historically confirmed as same-period; use promised/default lead time (0). To capture the recent spike while remaining responsive, forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 39\u201343) where demand = [61,52,41,431,250]; set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=5 so the OR backend computes base stock and cap from this recent regime. This balances service for the recent elevated volatility while avoiding overcommitment given holding cost equals profit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=133, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a large short-lived spike (P42=431, P43=250) amid otherwise low weekly demand; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To balance service vs holding cost I keep L as default (promised=0) and use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to overweight recent demand while damping the single extreme spike. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect current observed volatility over the last 5 weeks (Periods 40\u201344). This gives the OR engine a smoothed, responsive demand forecast while capturing recent variance.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand shows a holiday-period spike pattern (Periods 43\u201345 = 250, 34, 239) and elevated volatility. To capture the near-term holiday demand while respecting holding cost, I use the promised lead time (default L=0) and forecast demand using the most recent 3 weeks (recent_N N=3) so the backend targets supply for the immediate spike. Sigma is set from the same recent window (recent_N N=3) to reflect elevated short-term variability. No new sustained regime change qualifies for carry-over.

Recent demand shows a strong holiday/regional spike in Periods 43\u201346 (demands = 250, 34, 239, 117); to capture the current regime I use recent_N with N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the near-term holiday demand pattern while L=0 keeps review window minimal. This balances service (capture recent high demand weeks) against holding cost by focusing on the most recent 4 observations rather than the long-run average.
