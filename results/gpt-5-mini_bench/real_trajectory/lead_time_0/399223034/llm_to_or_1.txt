Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean 18.2 units and std \u22486.49. Profit/holding ratio (4/(4+1)=0.8) will be handled by OR engine. Use promised lead time (default=0) and default demand estimates to reflect full-sample baseline: mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)=18.2, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples)\u22486.49. This provides a stable starting forecast without overfitting short recent variation.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples mean=18.2, std\u22486.49; Period1 order (ordered P1) arrived same period (lead_time=0). No sustained demand regime change (recent demand=12 is one low week). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirms 0 so far). I keep mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding implies high fill target) against holding cost while avoiding overreacting to a single weak week or transient shipment noise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25. On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Observed lead times from concluded history: Period1 and Period2 arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. Recent demand (Period1 sold=12, Period2 sold=10) is below older sample mean (~18.2), suggesting a downshift but only 2 periods of evidence. I keep L as default (promised=0) since observed lead times match promised. I set mu_hat via EWMA_gamma (gamma=0.5) to bias the demand forecast toward recent lower sales while still incorporating older samples. I keep sigma_hat as default to let the backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings reduce target base-stock modestly to avoid excess holding cost given lower recent demand while maintaining service given confirmed short lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $12.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized lead times (Periods 1\u20133) are all 0 \u2192 confirm short lead. Recent on-site demand (Periods 1\u20133) = 12,10,6 showing a downward short-run regime; I therefore forecast using the most recent 3 demand observations to capture this shift. On-hand=12, in-transit=0; (1+L)*mean(last3) = 1*mean(12,10,6) \u2248 9.33 expected demand over the review+lead period, so no aggressive uplift. Chosen methods: L from recent observed lead times, mu_hat recent_N to react to recent lower demand, sigma_hat recent_N to reflect recent variability. This keeps base-stock conservative to limit holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Daily Profit: $20.00, Daily Holding Cost: $7.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $13.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent on-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show a sustained drop: Periods 1-3 concluded lead_times=0, recent demands (Periods 1-4) = [12,10,6,5]; older sample mean (2019-01-07..02-04)=18.2 vs recent mean=8.25. I set L by calculating observed lead times (all 0) to confirm same-period arrival. I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the new lower-demand regime (N=4 chosen = available recent concluded periods). This reduces overstock risk while allowing the OR backend to target the adjusted service level given profit/holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1,P2,P3 orders arrived same period); Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg decreased from 18.2 to 8.25 (-55%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $-2.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-03-18: recent demand has dropped (periods 1-5 sales = 12,10,6,5,2; mean=7). On-hand=10, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default (promised 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime (uses last 5 observed periods mean \u2192 (1+L)*mean). For volatility I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These settings shrink target base-stock to the new lower demand, reducing overstock/holding costs while preserving service given low demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_times = 0 for multiple orders) and a sustained drop in demand starting Period 5 (period demands: P1=12,P2=10,P3=6,P4=5,P5=2,P6=3). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use a recent_N (N=3) forecast to capture the new lower-demand regime (using the last 3 demands: 5,2,3 -> mean \u22483.33; (1+L) factor =1). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to reflect current lower-volatility in the recent regime. These choices keep target base stock low to avoid holding costs while preserving service given current low demand and confirmed immediate arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P7) shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals same period) and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 5. On-hand=1, in-transit=0 so availability is very low. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (all observed = 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 5\u20137 demands = 2,3,7 \u2192 lower mean); mu_hat uses recent_N to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of those recent samples, and sigma_hat uses recent_N to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders focused on the new, lower demand level to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for expected demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time 0 and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 5. Recent sales (Periods 5-8) are well below the earlier 2019 sample mean, so I bias forecasts to recent data to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime based on the most recent observations.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 confirmed fast replenishment. Demand regime dropped around Period 5 (post-change avg \u22488.25 over periods 5\u20139). To reflect the new, lower demand I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will remain 0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the post-change regime. This reduces target base-stock and holding costs while preserving service given current low demand and confirmed same-period arrivals.

Recent post-changepoint demands (Periods 5-10) = [2,3,7,2,2,4] (6 samples). No overdue shipments. Set L to promised (default 0). Forecast demand using recent_N over the last 6 post-changepoint samples to capture the lower regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of these 6). Match volatility to the same 6-sample window to reflect recent variability and avoid overstock given holding cost >0.

I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (the 7-week post-changepoint regime P5\u2013P11) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility, keeping service levels lean to limit holding cost while meeting current demand rates.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical demand fell sharply around Period 5 and has remained lower (Periods 5-12 demands = [2,3,7,2,2,4,5,8], regime length=8). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To reduce overstock vs holding cost while preserving service, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the confirmed low-demand regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P13) show actual lead time = 0 (all observed arrivals same period) and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 5 (post-change avg demand \u22488.25). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 (Period 5\u201313 regime length=9) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the recent low-demand regime, which reduces overstock while preserving service given low demand and non-existent in-transit stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical conclues confirm consistent same-period deliveries (lead time=0) and a sustained demand drop starting Period 5; recent regime (Period 5\u201314) length = 10 weeks. To respect the confirmed 0 lead time and to size orders to the lower recent demand regime, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 observed demands (captures the post-changepoint lower demand). Use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect observed volatility in the same recent regime. This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given the sustained lower demand and zero lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0; recent demand shows the lower regime established at Period 5 (~avg 8.25). To reflect confirmed same-day arrivals use default lead time (promised=0). To capture the reduced-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 5\u201315, N=11) so the OR engine targets lower base stock and reduces holding cost while preserving service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed P1-P16). Demand regime dropped at Period 5 and recent weeks show lower, variable demand with a modest uptick (last 5 concluded demands: 8,4,0,7,13; mean=6.4). To keep service while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time and base forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks to capture current regime and recent variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0. Demand regime dropped around Period 5 (carry-over) and recent weeks show low baseline with one large censored spike (Period 17 demand was 98 but sales capped by inventory). To avoid overreacting to the single censored spike, I use the promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on recent observations. I choose recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-change regime while smoothing the single high-censor observation; this keeps service levels reasonable without excessive holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sharp uptick in Periods 17-18 (98,73) with Period 16 at 13, indicating a potential recent regime change but only 3 most recent periods available for confirmation. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier). To respond quickly to the apparent demand surge while limiting exposure to holding cost, set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses last 3 periods: P16-18). Use recent_N, N=3 for sigma_hat as well to reflect the elevated volatility in the same recent window. These choices raise the base-stock to service the spike while using a small N to react promptly and avoid over-committing inventory over longer histories.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=58, in-transit=0. History shows consistent same-period arrivals (Periods 1-19 concludes) so lead time confirmed at 0; no overdue or lost shipments. Demand regime change was recorded earlier (Period 5) with lower baseline; recent periods include large reported demands but sales were supply-constrained (periods 17-19). To reflect confirmed LT=0 and prioritize recent realized demand patterns while avoiding over-weighting constrained spikes, I use calculated lead time from observed concludes and recent_N (N=15, the regime length since Period 5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the most relevant recent demand mean/volatility over the current regime. This balances service (captures recent higher variability) versus holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sharp pickup in demand beginning Period 17 (P17-20 demands: 98,73,41,34 with P16=13). No overdue shipments. Use L=default because lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (covers Periods 16-20 mean demand=51.8) so the OR backend increases target base-stock and accounts for higher variability; this balances higher profit ($4) vs $1 holding cost by raising service level while capping orders via the backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg increased from 8.25 to 51.8 (+528%) based on Periods 16-20 (13,98,73,41,34).

LLM Rationale:

Demand shifted up sharply starting Period 17 (samples P17-P21 = 98,73,41,34,27; recent mean ~54). To capture the new high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness (lead time 0), I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks that reflect the higher regime. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand variability. These choices raise the base-stock to meet current elevated demand while using recent variability to avoid excessive overstock given holding cost $1 and profit $4.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in history). Recent demand has settled down from the peak: last 5 demands (P18-P22) = 73,41,34,27,23 (mean\u224839.6). Given the confirmed 0 LT and recent regime mean, I use a short recent window to capture the current demand level while avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods. Profit=$4, Holding=$1 implies high target service level (q=0.8), so the OR backend should size stock toward demand volatility; using recent_N=5 for mu and sigma captures current mean/variance. This balances service (meet elevated recent demand) against holding cost (avoid overstock from the earlier extreme spike).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals from P1\u2013P23 had lead_time 0). Demand regime jumped ~P17 (periods 16\u201320 avg=51.8) but the most recent 5-week demand (P19\u2013P23 = 41,34,27,23,72; mean=39.4) is lower than that spike and appears to be the current regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods of demand. Set L by observed lead-times to match reality; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the latest regime and avoid over-ordering for the P17 spike. These parameters balance service (capture current elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than long-run averages inflated by the brief extreme spike.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 17 (recent weekly demands P20-24 = 34,27,23,72,42; recent 5-mean=39.6). On-hand=14, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historical concludes confirm actual lead time=0. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend confirm the observed 0-period lead time from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (reduces bias from older low-demand weeks). For volatility I also use recent_N N=5 to reflect current variability (including the 72 spike). These choices push the OR base-stock toward covering the current higher mean while keeping holding cost in mind because lead time is zero and on-hand is modest.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (multiple concluded arrivals same period) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (high demand, periods 17\u201325). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To reflect the new high-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0, confirmed by concludes) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime samples (Periods 17\u201325). I choose N=9 (regime length=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 9 samples, improving service for the elevated demand while keeping holding costs explicit to the backend.

Use recent_N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 16\u201326, regime length=11) so the OR backend sizes base-stock and cap to the current high mean and volatility, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0; demand shifted sharply up starting Period 16 (Period16-27 show elevated weekly demand: 13,98,73,41,34,27,23,72,42,55,97,123). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) given repeated confirmations. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 to capture the new high-demand regime (regime length 12 weeks, N chosen =12). This keeps the base-stock forecast responsive to the sustained higher mean and uses recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost when on-hand is zero and no pipeline exists.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (many P1..P28 arrivals same-period). Demand experienced a sustained high regime since Periods 16-28 (recent demands: P24-28 = 42,55,97,123,103). To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last five weeks. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded data strongly confirms 0. This raises the base-stock to meet current high demand while sigma_hat recent_N helps size safety stock without overstocking older low-demand periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=0 (many P orders arrived same period), so use observed-average lead time. Demand shifted up sharply starting Period 17 (Periods 16-20 sample mean 51.8; sustained high demand through Period 29). To capture the current high-demand regime, use recent_N across the recent regime (Periods 17-29, length=13) for both demand mean and volatility. These parameters keep base-stock aligned to the sustained higher demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand data; using calculate for L preserves the confirmed zero lead time and helps the OR backend size orders for same-period arrivals.

Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods confirmed); demand regime shifted up around Period 17 and has remained high through Period 30. I set L=default to use promised (and historically confirmed) 0. For demand I choose recent_N with N=15 (using Periods 16-30) to capture the sustained high-demand regime while avoiding older low-demand data. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=15 to reflect recent volatility. These choices produce a base_stock focused on the current high-demand regime and keep holding cost considered by the OR backend.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 16 (periods 16\u201331 show large weekly demand spikes, e.g. 13,98,73,41,34 then many weeks >70 through Period 31). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals same period). On-hand and in-transit are 0 so we must plan for (1+L) coverage immediately. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=16) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (use the last 16 demand samples to form (1+L)*mean). For volatility I use recent_N (N=16) to reflect current higher variability. These choices force the OR backend to target a base stock tuned to the new high-demand regime and its volatility while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with observed same-period arrivals.

Promised lead time was confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. I set L to default (promised 0) to let OR use promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (Periods 17\u201332) to base mu_hat on the post-changepoint high-demand regime and sigma_hat on the same window to reflect elevated volatility. These choices prioritize meeting the higher recent demand while letting the backend cap orders to control holding cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. Recent weeks show sustained high demand since Period 17 (week demands: 98,73,41,34,27,23,72,42,55,97,123,103,110,126,127,100,102) \u2014 regime start at Period 17 with elevated mean. On-hand=8, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical concludes confirm lead time=0. I set L to default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 to base mu_hat on the post-changepoint regime (captures current high-demand mean across review+lead). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=17 to reflect volatility in the current regime. These choices bias ordering toward serving the elevated demand while keeping holding exposure tied to observed variance; using recent_N avoids dilution by the earlier low-demand periods and addresses missing in-transit inventory (none observed).

To reflect the high-regime statistics I use recent_N with N=18 (covers Periods 17\u201334) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend builds base stock to cover the elevated, persistent demand while L=default (promised 0) matches observed lead time.

To reflect the high recent demand and to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind, set L to promised (default=0) and set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to capture current regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 17 (evidence: Periods 16-20 = 13,98,73,41,34 and subsequent consistently high weekly demand through Period 36). On-hand = 61, in-transit = 0; with promised lead time 0 and confirmed historical actual lead time = 0, same-period arrivals are expected. To reflect the post-Period-17 regime I set L to default (use promised 0) and estimate demand over the review+lead horizon using the most recent regime samples: recent_N with N=20 (Periods 17\u201336) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the current high-demand mean and volatility. This increases the base-stock target to avoid stockouts seen earlier while the sigma recent_N captures current variability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (multiple periods P1..P37 arrivals same period). Demand regime shifted up at Period 17 (Periods 16-20 mean=51.8) and the high-demand regime has persisted through Period 37 (21 periods). To capture the sustained higher demand I use a recent_N forecast covering the most recent 20 periods of the current regime. L set to calculated average of observed lead times (confirming 0). mu_hat: recent_N N=20 to reflect (1+L)\xd7mean over the recent high-demand regime and adapt inventory target to current demand. sigma_hat: recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock matched to observed variability. This balances service level (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost by using recent-regime statistics rather than long-ago low-demand data.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times remain 0 (confirmed Periods 1-38 arrivals same period). Recent demand after the large mid-year spike has trended lower but not yet a sustained regime shift; last 9 demands: 126,127,100,102,102,80,56,69,50 with a moderate decline. I select L=default to keep promised lead time=0 (supported by repeated evidence). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent behavior (Periods 34-38 demands = 102,102,80,56,69 \u2192 mean \u224881.8) which reduces exposure to the earlier peak. Sigma set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices lower target base-stock vs. using all-sample mean, reducing holding cost risk while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand remains in the high regime established at Period 17 (mean ~51.8) but has tapered in the last 5 weeks (Period 35-39 demands = 80,56,69,50,44; recent mean 59.8). On-hand=45, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time was 0 and multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual L=0 historically. To capture the recent downward drift within the high-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and volatility so the backend base-stock reflects the latest demand level and reduces overstocking as demand softens. L uses default (promised 0) consistent with observed concluded lead times. This balances service (use recent demand mean) against holding cost by shrinking safety stock to recent volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=39, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple P1-P40 arrivals same period). Demand regime shifted up at Period 17 (periods 16-20 showed 13,98,73,41,34 and subsequent weeks maintain higher demand). To capture the post-change regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime data; regime length since P17 is >20 so set N=20 (backend rule: N = min(regime_length,20)). This yields mu_hat based on the last 20 demand samples (covers review+lead with L=0) and sigma_hat from the same recent window. Using recent_N focuses orders on current higher mean and observed volatility while L=default (promised 0) keeps arrivals same-period, avoiding unnecessary safety stock tied to longer lead times.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand has settled well above the early-year low: last 5 demands (P37-P41) = 69,50,44,34,58 (mean=51). On-hand=48, in-transit=0 so current stock roughly one week of recent demand; no overdue/lost shipments visible and historical concludes confirm lead time=0. To keep service while limiting holding cost, use a short recent-window forecast (captures current regime after summer spike and fall moderation). Set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect current mean demand over the review+lead period. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical lead times consistently observed = 0 (confirmed P1..P42); a single extreme demand spike at Period 42 (338) appears event-driven (Black Friday week) and is not yet a sustained regime shift. To balance service vs. holding cost I keep L as default (promised=0) and use a short recent window to capture the near-term elevated demand: mu_hat recent_N=5 to reflect the last 5 weeks (including the spike) so OR increases replenishment immediately; sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility including that spike. No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=93, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a strong short-lived spike (Period 42 demand=338, P43=122) on top of an elevated post-June regime. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To respect fast-moving recent demand while not overreacting to a two-period spike, I keep L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use an EWMA to give substantial weight to the recent high observations while still smoothing (mu_hat: EWMA_gamma, gamma=0.5). Demand volatility appears elevated in the last few weeks, so I set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures last 5 demand samples 44,34,58,338,122) to reflect current variance. These choices push the backend toward higher base stock driven by recent demand but use EWMA smoothing and a recent volatility estimate to limit overstock risk given holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Historical lead times consistently 0 (confirmed many periods). Recent demand has surged in early Dec: Periods 40-44 demands = [34,58,338,122,130], indicating a holiday-season uplift. On-hand=136, in-transit=0 \u2014 still exposed to high weekly demand. I set L=default to keep promised lead time 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated weekly mean across the review+lead window. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) so volatility reflects recent surge and avoids underordering; these parameters steer the OR engine to a higher base-stock to meet holiday demand while the capped order limit prevents extreme spikes.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal demand spike confirmed in early Dec: Periods 42-44 demands = 338,122,130 (Dec weeks) indicating elevated holiday demand sustained for 3+ periods.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent sustained holiday spike began at Period 42 (demands 338,122,130,126 through Periods 42-45). To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N over the most recent 4-week holiday window. L uses promised/default (0). mu_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 4 samples. sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to reflect elevated volatility in the same window. These parameters bias order-up-to toward higher holiday demand while keeping inventory exposure controlled by using a short recent window.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent weeks show a sustained holiday spike: high demands in Periods 42-46. On-hand=147, in-transit=0 \u2014 healthy but demand remains elevated so use recent data to avoid understock. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so infer L via observed average. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated holiday regime (Periods 42-46) so the OR backend raises target base-stock and reflects higher volatility, balancing service level versus holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal holiday spike extended through Period 46: Periods 42-46 demands = 338,122,130,126,122 (5-period avg = 168.0, elevated vs prior regimes).
