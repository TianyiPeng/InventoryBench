This spike is a one-period outlier with no prior sustained evidence. Lead-time/missing orders: no lost shipments; pipeline = 0. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Forecast & order logic: because lead time=0, any order placed arrives this period and can satisfy Period 18 demand. Given the single-period extreme spike but generally low baseline, order a moderate quantity to balance service vs holding cost. I do not treat the Period 17 spike as a confirmed regime change (insufficient sustained evidence), so I avoid ordering enough to cover a repeat 98-unit demand but provide meaningful stock to reduce stockout risk while limiting holding cost.",
