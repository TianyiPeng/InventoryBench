OR's capped base-stock recommends 191 units based on long-run history and promised lead time; that is high relative to current average (~105) and would incur substantial holding cost if demand reverts.

Demand outlook: recent 8-week average demand \u224889/week with occasional spikes (notably 231 in Period 42). OR recommends 148 units using historical stats and promised LT; that target is reasonable for holiday-season upside. Strategy: target an on-hand level \u2248148 units (matching OR's base-stock target) to cover likely demand and safety stock. Therefore order = target_on_hand (148) \u2212 current_on_hand (36) = 112 units.

OR baseline recommends 65 using promised L and historical samples; with actual L=0 any order will arrive before demand this period. Risk tradeoffs: profit $4 vs holding $1 (q=0.8) justify stocking to avoid lost sales, but we already hold a healthy on-hand cushion (117 units \u2248 2+ weeks at current ~50\u201360 demand). Action decision: accept OR's recommended 65 units \u2014 it is conservative relative to recent spikes, will ensure coverage if demand reverts to ~60\u201390, and OR's cap prevents extreme orders.
