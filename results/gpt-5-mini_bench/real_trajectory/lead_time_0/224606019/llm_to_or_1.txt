Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) average 49.2 units/week; no on-hand or in-transit stock and no concluded lead-time observations. No evidence of regime change or delayed shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service vs. holding cost given lack of new signals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded history shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=0 (Period 1 conclude). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and last period demand (72) exceeded supply (sold 50) indicating demand can exceed single-order fills. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use the default method ((1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples) to anchor forecast to long-run weekly mean (~49.2) given no sustained regime change. Sigma uses default to reflect historical variability. These params balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and no evidence of elevated/declining demand or persistent delays.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders from P1 and P2 arrived with lead_time=0 (promised lead time confirmed). Recent realized demand in decision periods was high (72, 150) compared with older sample mean (~49), indicating upward pressure but only two high observations\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained regime change. To balance service vs holding cost: keep L at promised (default) since lead time observed=0; use an EWMA (gamma=0.5) for mu_hat to weight recent high demand more than older samples; keep sigma_hat as default to let backend compute variability from all samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Recent realized lead times (Periods 1-3) are all 0, so use calculated lead time. Demand shows a clear upward shift in the most recent 3 periods (72,150,78) vs prior historical mean (~49.2). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the current higher-demand regime so the OR backend raises the base stock and accounts for increased variability. This helps balance higher stockouts risk from elevated demand against holding cost; using recent data avoids diluting the signal with older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: recent 3-period avg=100 vs prior sample avg\u224849.2 (+~103%), sustained over last 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $-4.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand regime shifted at Period 4: last 3-period average \u2248100 (sustained). To react to the higher recent demand I set L=default (promised 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most recent 3 periods, improving service vs. holding-cost balance given the clear +100% demand spike and no evidence of lost shipments.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand shows a sustained upward regime detected at Period 4 (user carry-over): recent demand elevated vs prior historical mean. On-hand=39, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Use promised lead time (default L=0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new regime (most recent 3 demand observations) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and inflates safety stock around the recent higher mean/volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given higher recent demand) versus holding cost by restricting the window to recent data rather than all historical samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals (P1\u2013P6) show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demands (P4\u2013P6 = 48,53,60) revert near historical mean; no new sustained regime shift detected. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so backend uses full sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost ($1/$1) implying moderate target fill without extra safety stock.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish. Historical baseline (early Jan samples) mean\u224849.2 but recent demand shows a higher regime earlier (P1-3 avg\u2248100) then softened; most recent periods (P5-P7 = 53,60,68) average \u224860.3. Lead-time observations (conclude messages P1-P7) consistently show 0 periods. To reflect the latest realized demand while remaining responsive to recent variability, I set L by averaging observed lead times, and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast on the last three demand observations (P5-P7). This keeps the base-stock adaptive to current demand and limits overordering given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=16, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments observed; concluded lead times have been 0 in all concluded periods. Recent demand (Periods 4-8) is modestly higher than the Jan baseline, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded history confirms 0. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent 5 demand observations and adapt to the regime shift noted earlier. Use sigma_hat default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (capture recent higher demand) versus holding cost by avoiding over-explicit inflation of variability.

No new sustained demand regime change detected since prior carry-over insight. Profit=holding so critical fractile q=0.5 (balanced service vs. holding). Use default lead time and default demand statistics so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the capped policy determine order quantity given current pipeline.

On-hand=23, in-transit=0, recent demand history shows no new sustained upward regime (recent periods 8-10 demand =45,46,39). Promised lead time=0 is consistent with observed data, so set L to calculated average (0). Use default demand and volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1 vs $1) which implies neutral risk loading.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: 68,45,46,39,44) centers ~48 units \u2014 the earlier high-volatility spike is not persistent. To target current demand regime and avoid excess holding (profit=holding), set L to default (promised=0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the immediate recent mean. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent variability. These choices keep the base-stock aligned with recent demand while limiting inventory given equal profit/holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently. Recent demand shows elevated variability with a large spike (Period 12 demand=101). To be responsive to the most recent regime while limiting inventory risk, set lead time to promised (default=0) and forecast using the most recent 3 weeks to capture the spike and short-term variability. mu_hat uses recent_N N=3; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show all observed lead_times = 0; recent demand has shifted higher (carry-over notes a sustained regime change). To react to the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping lead-time estimate truthful, set L via observed history and use recent_N=3 for demand moments to capture the new regime (short memory to adapt to spike). This provides a larger base_stock reflecting the recent elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N=3 captures recent volatility; these choices balance service-level vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1 -> q=0.5).

All observed lead times have been 0 historically, so use promised lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime and its volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (Periods 12-14).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been persistently higher since Period 4 (sustained elevated sales including 101,109 in P12-13 and continued strong demand through P15). On-hand=36, in-transit=0, so we cannot rely on pipeline to cover upcoming demand. Promised lead time has historically concluded as 0 in all observed periods, so keep L as default. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent 12 periods (regime length P4\u2013P15 = 12) so the forecast reflects the new mean and avoids under-ordering. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to improve service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while sigma estimated from recent data tunes safety stock to limit excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has been variable with past sustained uplift: historical early-Jan mean ~49 but a confirmed regime shift at Period 4 produced several high-demand weeks. Current inventory: on-hand=25, in-transit=0 (no arrivals pending). Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0, so use default L to let backend assume promised LT. To respond to the recent higher and volatile demand while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent short regime: use recent_N with N=3 to reflect immediate demand level/variance (captures the latest weeks where demand changed). This biases orders toward current demand patterns and keeps safety stock aligned with short-term volatility so OR backend balances service vs holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Recent demand has moderated vs the earlier high-regime spike; last 3 demands = 57, 37, 32 (avg 42). All concluded lead times = 0 (no evidence of delay). To react to the recent lower regime, use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility so base_stock reflects current demand; keep L=default (promised = 0) since concluded history confirms 0 lead time. This balances service (capturing current demand) against holding cost by reducing forecasted (1+L)-period demand to the recent average.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Promised lead time historically observed = 0. To avoid excess holding given Profit=Holding, I use default lead time (promised 0), a recent_N mu_hat (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime while ignoring short two-week spikes, and default sigma_hat to use overall historical volatility. These parameters aim to match order targets to recent demand and limit inventory carrying costs given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 4; latest periods show volatile but elevated weekly demand (Periods 15-19 demands = 57,37,32,38,96). Use promised lead time (default 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand forecast, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent regime while smoothing short spikes; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters give the OR backend a (1+L)-period demand mean and recent std, raising target base stock to protect service during this higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check by limiting horizon to recent samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (all past orders arrived same period). Demand regime shift was previously detected at Period 4 and has persisted; to capture the current elevated regime I use a recent-window demand estimate. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (observed consistent). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=18 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent sustained regime (Period4\u2192Period20, 18 samples) so the base-stock reflects the higher recent demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=18 to capture recent volatility and ensure safety stock balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 4 (higher weekly demand since early March, including repeated 80-100+ weeks). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) review+lead demand. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so use default L. For demand I adopt recent_N to capture the new regime (use the last 18 periods since the changepoint at Period 4, regime length \u224818) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds base-stock reflecting the elevated mean and observed volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) versus holding cost by relying on recent-regime stats rather than diluted long-run averages.

To reflect higher recent demand and reduce stockouts, set demand forecast using recent 5-week average for the review+lead period; match sigma to recent 5-week volatility. This increases target base-stock relative to long-run mean while keeping lead time at promised 0.

LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-07-22. On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use promised lead time. Recent demand has softened from the spike seen earlier; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 19-23) = [96,82,80,53,39] \u2014 using recent_N=5 captures this downward shift while remaining responsive. Profit and holding cost are equal (q=0.5 \u2192 z\u22480), so base-stock will align with (1+L)*recent mean to balance service vs. holding. sigma_hat uses recent variability (N=5) to size safety appropriately for short lead time.

To keep the OR backend aligned with long-run stats and avoid overreacting to short noise, I select default methods so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (profit=holding so q=0.5) versus holding cost conservatively given current on-hand stock and zero in-transit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/8/5. On-hand=6, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this period. Historical conclude messages show actual lead_time consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so use promised lead time. A sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 4 (higher mean since then); to capture the current regime I use recent_N over the last 20 demand samples for both mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the post-changepoint behavior and balance service level vs holding cost.

Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) shows lower/variable weekly demand vs earlier spikes, so set forecast using recent 5 samples to reflect current regime and reduce overstock risk. sigma set from recent 5 to capture current volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to recent demand while limiting holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

LLM Rationale:

Recent demands (Periods 25-27 = 56,36,30) do not provide evidence of a new sustained regime beyond the previously recorded Period 4 insight. To avoid overreacting to transient spikes and because promised lead time is 0 with consistent confirmations, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full sample statistics.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=6, in-transit=0; recent demand (last 5 weeks) avg ~42 units. Historical observed lead times all 0. Set L to promised (default). Use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to reflect latest demand regime and avoid overreacting to older high spikes. Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). With profit=holding, service quantile is 0.5 so base_stock equals mu_hat; this balances fill rate vs holding given equal profit/holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has trended upward (last 3 periods: 30,54,83) consistent with earlier documented regime shift; to react to the higher recent demand I shorten the forecast window to the most recent samples. Use promised lead time (default=0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the elevated recent mean/volatility while smoothing one-off noise; this increases the base_stock to improve service given zero inventory and equal profit/holding costs.

A sustained demand regime shift was identified at Period 4 (higher mean since); to capture the current regime I use recent data. Set L to promised (default=0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime (capped at 20 periods). This raises target base-stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping sigma based on recent variability so the OR backend can balance service level against holding cost.

Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 periods to capture the current regime; this keeps the base-stock near recent demand (profit and holding cost equal, so service-level target ~50%) while limiting excess inventory given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently (orders in history arrived same period). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. Recent demand has been above the long-run mean in the last few weeks (e.g., periods ~30-34 demand: 60,53,61,52,59,92 etc. recent volatility and upward pressure), so I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat with N=5 to emphasize recent demand levels while avoiding overfitting to a single high week. Sigma_hat uses default (all-sample std scaled) to give the OR engine a conservative risk estimate. These parameters balance service (capture recent uptick) vs holding cost by leaning on recent demand for sizing but keeping variance estimate broad.

A demand regime shift was previously detected at Period 4 and has persisted; recent demand levels remain elevated versus the original small-sample mean. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent regime while capping at 20). This raises target base stock to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat from recent data balances service level vs holding cost.

Date 2019-10-28. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead demand. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0; keep L=default. A sustained demand regime shift was detected at Period 4 and has persisted through recent periods, so use recent_N=20 to capture the new regime for both mean and volatility (N=max(min(regime_length,20),3) with regime_length>20). This biases orders toward current higher-demand regime and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1 vs $1).

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0; no new evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. A previously recorded demand regime shift (Period 4) exists but no additional sustained changepoint in the recent history that would justify altering forecasting windows. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use default lead time and full-sample demand mean/volatility so base-stock reflects long-run demand while avoiding overreaction to recent noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period across history), and no new sustained lead-time signal. A demand regime shift was previously recorded at Period 4; recent weeks (P37-39) show lower demand, so no new changepoint. To let the OR engine use full-sample demand statistics and the promised lead time, I select default lead time and default demand moments. This balances service vs holding cost by relying on long-run mean/volatility rather than short noisy windows when no new sustained shift is evident.

Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (all concluded messages report lead_time 0). No overdue or lost shipments visible. Recent demand history contains variability but no new sustained changepoint since the previously recorded Period 4 shift. Given clear historical lead-time=0 and no fresh evidence of a regime change, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this keeps the policy stable and balances service vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent observed concluded lead times = 0 consistently; on-hand=22, in-transit=0. Recent demand has moderated (last 3 concluded demands: 29,38,25) and earlier carry-over noted a sustained regime shift at Period 4, but no new sustained change since. To avoid excess holding (holding cost = profit), use default lead time and demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full history; this balances service vs holding given q=0.5 (z*=0).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods. Demand history shows a sustained higher regime beginning at Period 4 and variable recent demand with a large spike at Period 42; to be responsive to recent demand shifts while avoiding over-weighting a single spike, I use a recent-N demand estimate over the last 20 periods. L set to default (promised=0) because observed lead times have been 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=20) to capture current mean and volatility over the most recent regime, helping the OR backend target a higher base-stock for service while capping orders to limit holding cost exposure.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep L as promised (default). Demand shows a sustained upward regime established at Period 4 (already recorded), but recent holiday volatility (large spike at P42) motivates weighting recent data more heavily while avoiding overfit to a single spike \u2014 use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to emphasize recent weeks smoothly. Keep sigma_hat as default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L)^0.5. These choices keep base stock responsive to recent demand increases while the default sigma preserves caution against underestimating variability; using default L ensures alignment with observed concluded lead times and avoids assuming missing shipments.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-12-16. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 4 (recent 3-period avg much higher than earlier baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Use L=default since all concluded arrivals indicate lead_time=0 historically. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to focus the forecast on the new higher regime (captures latest mean over review+lead). For volatility use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability rather than long-run low-variance history. These choices raise base_stock to protect service during the higher-demand regime while keeping sigma tied to recent variability so the OR backend's cap calculation remains responsive to short-term risk.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (no evidence of delays); demand regime shifted up at Period 4 and has persisted. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-regime demand (use most recent 20 weeks to reflect current demand level and seasonality around Dec). Use sigma recent_N N=20 to reflect recent variability. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the elevated recent demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent history shows several December demand spikes (Period 42 demand=135; Periods 43-46 variable with some high weeks) but overall history contains many weeks with lead_time observed=0 consistently. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we need an order this decision to cover immediate demand. I set L=default because all concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 (no evidence of persistent delays or lost shipments). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std (scaled by 1+L) to compute the base-stock and cap; this leverages the long-run demand history while letting the backend's service-level math balance profit vs holding cost.
