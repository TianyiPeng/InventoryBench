Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. History: five weekly samples (68,109,126,114,116) \u2192 mean \u2248106.6, no concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time issues. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No sustained changepoint detected. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean \u2248106.6 and std \u224820.1. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 order (107) arrived in Period 1 and sold through, so no overdue shipments. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use the full-sample defaults so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect stable recent weekly demand (~107 units). Sigma uses default to reflect historical variability (~20 units). These settings keep the backend base-stock near observed demand while avoiding extra inventory given equal profit and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order placed P1 arrived in P1: arrived=107 units, lead_time=0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent concluded data show actual lead time = 0 (Period1 & Period2 arrivals had lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean = 106.6 (samples: 68,109,126,114,116). Period1/2 demands (147,178) are above historical mean but only two periods\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained regime shift. Use lead time inferred from observed history (calculate). Use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to keep provisioning tied to long-run samples while we collect more evidence of higher demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent concludes show sustained higher demand the last 3 periods (147,178,141) vs historical sample mean (\u2248106.6). Lead time has been observed as 0 in multiple concluded periods. I set L to calculate (backend will infer observed lead time). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 weeks). For volatility I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices raise target base_stock to meet higher short-term demand while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the OR cap.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: avg increased from 106.6 to 155.3 (+46%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $102.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean (2019 Jan) =106.6 but a sustained higher-demand regime was detected starting Period 3 (higher weekly demand). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To be responsive to the detected demand regime shift while remaining robust to recent variability, set lead time to be inferred from observations (calculate). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stock for the most recent higher-demand regime (short horizon: last 3 weeks) and captures recent volatility. This balances service level (capture recent demand increase) against holding cost by avoiding reliance on older, lower-demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $64.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=43, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Observed lead times confirmed 0 in concluded history (multiple periods). Recent demand regime shift identified earlier (from ~106.6 to higher levels starting Period 3); to adapt while being conservative I use the most recent 3 demand observations (Periods 3-5) to set demand forecasts and volatility. L set to calculated (observed average lead time=0). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to capture the post-changepoint regime (short sample since shift began at Period 3). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These settings give the OR engine a short-window forecast that raises target stock for the higher-demand regime while keeping holding risk constrained given current on-hand inventory.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift upward beginning at Period 3. I use lead-time average from observations to lock L=0 (method: calculate). For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 3\u20136) using recent_N with N=4 to capture the higher recent mean (reduces overweighting older low-demand samples). sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep base-stock aligned to the new, higher demand while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost = profit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). History shows multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=0 (P1..P7), and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 3 (higher mean since P3). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must restock to meet elevated regime. Set L to calculate (use observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 3\u20137, 5 samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=5 to capture current volatility. These choices align base stock to the confirmed shorter lead time and higher recent demand while keeping variability estimate focused on the new regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 in multiple periods and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 3. On-hand=25, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To target service while limiting holdings, keep L as default (promised=0) and use recent data from the current elevated regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (uses last 6 concluded demand samples) so the backend base-stock reflects the post-changepoint mean and recent volatility, improving service on observed higher demand while avoiding excess inventory buildup.

Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 \u2192 actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand has moderated from the earlier spike; I use the last 5 concluded demand observations (Periods 5\u20139: 107,139,166,112,131; mean=131) to adapt the forecast and avoid overstock given holding cost equal to profit. Set L to calculated average lead time (0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest regime while keeping responsiveness to further shifts. No evidence of lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show confirmed lead time = 0 and a demand regime shift upward starting Period 3 (sustained higher demand since). To protect service while avoiding excess holding (profit and holding cost equal), I choose L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N to capture the post-changepoint regime (most relevant recent 8 weeks, Periods 3\u201310) so mu_hat reflects the higher mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N with the same N to reflect current volatility. This balances service (covers higher recent demand) against holding costs given limited on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 3 (sustained increase); use recent data from that regime. On-hand=26, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (avg=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (periods 3\u201311) to capture the post-changepoint higher mean and its variability; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=9 so the OR backend sizes safety stock to the recent volatility. These choices keep service high for the sustained elevated demand while avoiding undue holding from older low-demand samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand settled lower after the earlier uptick; last 5 demands (Periods 8-12) average ~111.8. On-hand=13, in-transit=0 so low coverage; no overdue arrivals. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods. Set L by calculating average observed lead times (all zeros). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current lower regime; this keeps base_stock responsive and limits holding given $1 profit vs $1 holding.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand regime increased around Period 3 (carry-over note). To capture the post-changepoint demand level, set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the entire post-changepoint regime (Periods 3\u201313 => N=11). This biases mu_hat/sigma_hat to the higher recent mean/volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet higher demand while avoiding assumptions about lead-time shifts or lost shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 and stable weekly demand with a past regime shift already recorded. Current on-hand=42, in-transit=0 \u2014 with L=0 arrivals would be same-period. To let the OR engine compute base_stock and caps using full-sample statistics, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend uses promised lead time and all historical samples for mean/variance estimates, balancing service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=64, in-transit=0. Historical conclues show consistent actual lead time = 0 (orders from P1..P15 arrived same period). Recent demand has softened (Periods 11-15 demands = 103,113,124,83,58; recent mean ~96). Given confirmed LT=0 and a clear recent downward move versus earlier higher regime, use L=default to keep promised LT=0, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods to capture the recent lower mean and volatility so the OR engine reduces target base-stock and limits holding cost while preserving service.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 Period17. On-hand=72, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 across many periods. Recent demand has declined sharply since Period14; to adapt I use a recent-window forecast. L set by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=8) to reflect the last 8 weeks' lower demand (captures the downward regime). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent drop in demand, reducing overstock risk given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5, moderate service target).

Carry-over insight: Demand decline starting Period14: avg (P9-P13)=114.2 \u2192 avg (P14-P16)=55.3 (\u221251.6%)

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time=0). Demand declined starting Period 14 (P14-P17 demand: 83,58,25,37 \u2192 recent avg low). On-hand=56, in-transit=0 so available coverage is limited; avoid overstock given holding cost = profit. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 14-17) to capture the new lower-demand regime; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These choices let the OR backend target a lower base-stock appropriate for the sustained demand drop while preserving service with minimal excess holding.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times confirm actual L=0 (multiple periods). Demand has entered a sustained lower regime starting Period 14 (P14-P18 recent demands = 83,58,25,37,29; mean=46.4). I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture the post-Period-14 lower-demand regime. This reduces target base-stock to match current lower demand and limits holding cost given equal profit/holding (q=0.5, z*=0).

Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 14 (P14-P19 show reduced demand); to reflect the recent lower average I use recent_N=6 (covering P14-P19). L left as default (promised=0). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat makes the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent low-demand regime, reducing order targets and holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Observed sustained demand decline starting Period 14 (carry-over note) \u2014 recent weeks show much lower demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To adapt, use promised/default lead time=0. For demand forecast use recent_N (last N=5 weeks) to capture the new low-demand regime (periods 16\u201320 demands: 25,37,29,15,5) so mu_hat reflects the reduced mean; use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent lower volatility. This keeps orders aligned to the depressed demand, limiting holding cost while preserving service.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent history shows a sustained demand decline starting Period 14 (weeks P14\u2013P21 lower than earlier regime). On-hand=33, in-transit=0 so available stock is limited; no shipments overdue. Promised lead time=0 and concluded arrivals historically confirm 0 lead time. To avoid excess inventory given equal profit and holding cost, I use a recent-demand estimate reflecting the lower regime: set L=default (use promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 (covering Period14\u2013Period21) to capture the sustained lower mean and reduced volatility; this reduces target base stock and holding cost while maintaining service for current lower demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has fallen markedly since the Period 14 regime change (noted previously). Last 5 realized weekly demands (Periods 18-22) = [29,15,5,4,13], mean \u224813.2 units; inventory on-hand=20, in-transit=0, so current stock roughly 1.5 weeks of recent demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I therefore set L to default (promised 0). To align ordering with the new low-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base-stock and cap on the most recent low-demand mean and volatility, reducing overstock risk while preserving service given small on-hand stock.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2192P1 etc.). Demand has been in a sustained lower regime since Period 14 (recent weeks show weekly demand mostly in single/double digits vs. earlier 100+ levels). No overdue arrivals visible. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 14\u201323) so mu_hat matches current low demand and avoids overstock; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=10) to reflect reduced volatility in the new regime. These choices aim to keep base stock low to balance profit and holding cost given low demand and no in-transit protection.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen to very low levels (Periods 19-24 demands = [15,5,4,13,12,5], mean\u22489). Lead times have consistently been 0 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting this new low-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (focus on last 6 weeks). Use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent low volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained demand decline starting Period 14 (confirmed earlier): recent 12-week mean demand \u224825.1 units (P14\u2013P25). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods. On-hand=9, in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover (1+L) period(s). I choose L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (captures P14\u2013P25 average \u224825.1). For volatility I also use recent_N N=12 so the OR backend computes safety stock from recent variability rather than older high-demand regime. These parameters bias orders low to avoid high holding cost given profit=holding and the clear demand drop.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has been low since the decline starting Period 14; latest observed demands (P20-P26) = [5,4,13,12,5,15,45] though P26 sales were supply-constrained (sold 26 of demand 45). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To avoid excess holding cost while matching the new lower regime, set L to promised (default=0) and forecast demand using a recent-window that captures the post-decline regime but tolerates sampling noise; use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 7 samples. This balances service (covers recent demand variability) against high holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent history shows confirmed lead time 0 and a sustained demand decline starting Period 14 with some recovery in Periods 26-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods of demand. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (confirmed as 0 by concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (Period14\u201327 regime) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower recent demand regime while allowing the OR engine to cap orders. This balances service (capture recent uptick in P26-27) against holding cost by relying on recent observed mean/volatility rather than long-run higher past means.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0; no overdue shipments. Demand has sharply risen in the last 3 periods (P26-P28: 45,79,56) after a multi-period low. To capture this recent regime while keeping lead-time model aligned with observed arrivals, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory for the current higher-demand regime and balances service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg (P21-P25)=9.8 \u2192 avg (P26-P28)=60 (+512%)

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows lead time consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. Demand has a recent high regime starting Period 26 (demands: P26=45, P27=79, P28=56, P29=54) \u2014 a sustained elevated level vs prior low months. On-hand=6, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (reflecting confirmed 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the last 4 periods (regime length=4) so mu_hat reflects the new higher demand regime. Sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=4 to capture recent volatility. These choices help the OR backend raise the base-stock to serve the elevated demand while keeping variability and lead-time assumptions aligned to concluded evidence.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P30 all show lead_time=0). Recent demand shows a sharp spike in Period 30 (demand=147) after elevated demands in P26\u2013P29; to be responsive I use a short recent window. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). Set mu_hat = recent_N with N=5 (captures P26\u2013P30 demand = 45,79,56,54,147 \u2192 recent mean \u224876.2). Set sigma_hat = recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR backend focused on recent regime while using confirmed lead-time=0 so orders can arrive same period, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding ($1/$1).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period) so keep L = default (promised 0). Recent demand shows a strong spike in Periods 30\u201331 (demands: 147, 203) with elevated values in the 5-period window (P27\u2013P31 demands = 79,56,54,147,203; mean \u2248 107.8). To respond to the apparent recent higher-demand regime while limiting reaction to single outliers, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (covers most recent short-term regime). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices give the OR engine a short-term demand view (higher \u03bc\u0302 and matching \u03c3\u0302) while relying on proven zero lead time to avoid extra pipeline buffer.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained spike in the last 3 weeks (Periods 30-32 = 147,203,215) so I use a short recent window to capture the new higher mean and volatility. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 (confirmed many concluded messages), so keep L=default. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 samples and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility; this lets the OR backend raise the base-stock and cap to meet the higher immediate demand while limiting excess inventory by using a small N.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike starting Period 30: avg(P30-P32)=188.33 units (+239% vs avg P26-P29\u224855.6); sustained for 3 periods (P30,P31,P32).

Actual observed lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use promised lead time. Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime; set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base stock for higher fill-rate while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand periods. No new carry-over insight.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order from P1\u2013P34 arrived same period). Recent demand has a sustained spike starting Period 30: demands P30\u2013P34 = [147,203,215,344,311] (avg=244). I set L to calculate to confirm observed lead time=0 from history. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (the recent spike regime length P30\u2013P34) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher mean and volatility of this sustained spike; this raises the base-stock to serve high near-term demand while avoiding ordering on stale low-demand history. No missing shipments detected.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike sustained starting Period 30: avg(P30-P34)=244 (+29.6% vs avg P30-P32=188.33)

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 repeatedly (orders placed each period have arrived same period). Demand has sustained a higher regime from Period 30\u201335 (sustained spike; avg P30\u2013P34\u2248244; P30\u2013P35 length=6). With profit=holding, target service quantile ~50%; to capture the recent sustained uplift I use recent_N over the 6-period high-demand regime so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current elevated mean and volatility while L remains the promised/confirmed 0 to ensure same-period replenishment assumptions hold.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (many 'lead_time=0' observations), so use calculated lead time. Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 30 (Periods 30\u201336 high; recent regime length=7). I choose L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=0; mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=7 to target the current high-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 7 demands and matching std). This raises the base-stock to reduce stockouts during the sustained spike while sigma_hat from recent volatility keeps safety stock sensible versus holding cost.

Demand has a sustained high regime since Period 30 (P30\u2013P37 mean \u2248265.9); to capture current elevated demand I use recent_N with N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean over the most recent high-demand window and captures its volatility. This raises base-stock to meet current spike while avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent demand has been in a high regime since Period 30 and remains strong through Period 38 (recent demands: P34=311, P35=317, P36=266, P37=324, P38=293). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to focus the forecast on the most recent five weeks; keep L at default (promised lead time = 0) since observations confirm 0 lead time. This raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma from recent data informs safety stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 30 (multiple weeks of 147\u2013344 demand); on-hand=26, in-transit=0. Lead time history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 repeatedly). To let the OR engine use full historical data while keeping parameters consistent with confirmed 0 lead time, I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples with promised lead time. This leverages the confirmed 0 LT, captures the sustained high-demand regime in the historical mean/variance, and avoids overreacting to any single-week fluctuation.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time repeatedly 0; recent demand regime is the sustained high-volume regime that began at Period 30 (elevated weekly demand through Period 40). I set L to default (promised lead time=0) consistent with observed deliveries. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained high-demand regime from Period 30\u201340 (regime_length=11) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=11 to capture recent volatility. These settings bias the base-stock upward to meet high recent demand while letting the backend cap limit order size.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has been in a high regime (Periods 36-41 demands: 266,258,266,303,325,290). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 no evidence to change promised lead time. I choose L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) so mu_hat targets the current high-demand regime (covers (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 weeks) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts during sustained spike) against holding cost given profit=holding. No in-transit stock means orders should replenish immediately (lead time 0) so using recent demand avoids under-ordering into this spike.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistently observed lead_time=0 (no evidence of delays). Demand has a sustained high regime since Period 30 with especially strong recent demand (Periods 38\u201342: 293,277,325,290,355). To protect service during this sustained high-demand regime I use the promised lead time (default) and base stock inputs driven by the most recent 5 demand observations (captures current elevated mean and volatility). This balances service (capture recent spike) against holding cost by limiting horizon to recent data.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=111, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Demand exhibits a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 30 (P30\u2013P43 elevated vs earlier periods). I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (returns 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean and volatility: N=14 (Periods 30\u201343). This biases mu_hat and sigma_hat to the recent high-demand regime, improving service during the sustained spike while the OR backend will cap orders per its policy to limit excess holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time repeatedly = 0 and multiple sustained demand regime shifts with a strong elevated demand regime since Period 30; recent weeks (Periods 41-45) show high demand (290, 355, 197, 319, 475) \u2014 recent mean \u2248 327. To capture the current high-demand/high-volatility regime and because no shipments are overdue or lost, I keep promised lead time (L=default) and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current spike. This provides a base_stock that responds to the holiday/high-demand regime while sigma is based on the same recent window to reflect increased variability, helping the OR backend trade service level vs holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0), so keep L=default. Recent periods (P37\u2013P46) show a sustained high-demand regime and late-Nov/Dec spike (multiple weeks with demand >> historical mean), so I bias the forecast to recent data. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent high-demand regime while smoothing short-week noise. This gives the OR engine an updated (1+L)-period mean and volatility that prioritize service during the sustained holiday/high-demand period while the backend's cap limits extreme orders.
