  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Carry-over insight and concluded history confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders historically arrive same period). Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand = 10, in-transit = 0. Recent concluded demands (Periods 43\u201346) = 52, 52, 50, 52 \u2192 recent mean \u2248 51.5/week; this matches the low-regime (~50s) recorded in carry-over insights. Profit = $1 and holding = $1 gives critical fractile q = 0.5 \u2192 z* = 0, so the optimal base-stock target \u2248 expected (L+1)-period demand = single-period mean \u2248 51.5. With lead time 0 we must cover current period demand after ordering. Target on-hand after arrival = 51.5 \u2192 required order = target \u2212 current on-hand = 51.5 \u2212 10 \u2248 41.5. Rounding to whole units and being conservative (avoid stockouts but not build excess given equal holding cost), I order 42 units.
