Lead time: supplier promised 0 but no concluded arrivals observed yet, so actual lead time is unknown; assume deliveries may take \u22650 periods and could arrive with at least a 1-period observation lag, so be conservative. Inventory/pipeline: starting on-hand=0; to avoid lost sales at a high unit profit ($19) accept modest holding cost ($1/unit/period). Final order logic: cover expected near-term demand (one-week demand) plus small safety for a likely Valentine uplift; do not overstock given holding cost.
