Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 507883014 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and only historical weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb 2019 (31,60,70,64,68). No concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change. I use default lead time (promised), and default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This is conservative given no new signals and ensures orders cover the review+lead demand while letting the backend trade service level vs holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean \u224858.6 units/week; Period1 order (P1) arrived same period (lead_time=0). On-hand=37, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0 and an observed 0-period arrival, use inferred lead time via observed history to align OR engine with actual same-period arrivals. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times (reflecting the confirmed 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, providing a stable baseline forecast and volatility for the capped base-stock policy while avoiding overreaction to a single period of demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-2 arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 for both), so actual lead time appears 0. Historical demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) mean=58.6; recent period demands (48,69) are within historical variation but not a sustained regime shift. To keep the backend aligned with observed zero lead time and use long-run demand stats, set L by calculating from observed lead times; use default demand and volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (use observed fast lead time) versus holding cost by not inflating forecast from a short 2-period uptick.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded demands: P1=48, P2=69, P3=64; historical sample mean (2019-01) = 58.6. On-hand=19, in-transit=0, no missing arrivals; observed lead times in concluded history = 0 periods consistently. No sustained demand regime shift detected. Use default promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend uses full-sample statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which balance service level vs holding cost given stable recent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1178.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent observed weekly demand samples (historic series) average ~58.6 units/week. On-hand=19, in-transit=0; prior periods show consistent same-period arrivals. I set L by calculating observed lead times to capture confirmed lead-time behavior. I use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples) so the OR engine uses the full historical mean (no detected demand regime change) while recognizing confirmed lead time=0; this balances service level (meet ~weekly demand ~58.6) against holding cost given low holding penalty.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1->arrived P1, P2->arrived P2, P3->arrived P3, P4->arrived P4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1259.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time 0; demand history (samples) mean ~58.6/wk and std ~14.2. Use promised/confirmed lead time=0 and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap from full-sample statistics; this balances service (reasonable weeks-of-cover) vs low holding cost given current on-hand and stable demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 across P1\u2013P6) and recent demand has been stable in the low-to-mid 60s (period demands: 48,69,64,63,67,60). Use L=default to keep promised lead time (0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 demand observations (captures current regime). This balances service (cover ~1 period) against low holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P7) shows stable weekly demand (mean \u224860.4 units/week) and confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals matched orders every concluded period). On-hand = 23, in-transit = 0. No evidence of a sustained demand regime change or shipment loss. Use promised lead time (default) and population-based demand estimates so the OR engine applies its base-stock formula with full historical mean/variance. This balances service (given profit $19 vs holding $1) without overreacting to short noise.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Recent conclude history shows all observed lead times = 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P8 arrived same period), so I set L using observed data. Use default demand/statistics to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the provided historical samples; this balances service vs. holding cost given steady demand history and confirmed zero lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 observed across many periods) and last demand sample set (31,60,70,64,68) has mean \u224858.6. Current on-hand=50, in-transit=0. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no sustained demand regime change (demand samples are stable), use default calculations: rely on promised lead time, and let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using historical mean) against holding cost; no explicit inflation of forecast despite on-hand being slightly below one period mean because arrivals are same-period.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent on-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a downward shift since Period 9 (recent 5-period mean = 46.6 vs overall ~54). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To reduce holding while maintaining service, set lead time by observed average and use recent_N (N=5) demand estimates to capture the recent lower-demand regime and elevated relative variability.

Demand history available; profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit implies relatively high service-level target. Use default lead time (promised 0, confirmed) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, producing a base-stock that balances high profit-driven service level against low holding cost.

Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given stable lead time and demand history.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed previously). Recent demand history (training samples) mean ~58.6; no sustained regime shift in demand or lead time since last conclude. To balance profit vs holding cost with same-period arrivals, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This keeps orders responsive (L=0) while avoiding unnecessary inventory buildup given holding cost=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand spike (Period 14 demand=83, stockout end Period 14) warrants replenishment. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (P1\u2013P14 arrivals matched orders), so use promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to set base-stock and cap; this balances service level after the recent high demand while keeping holding cost considerations standard.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent history shows volatile weekly demand with a large spike in Period 15 (d=140) causing stockouts; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 historically, so use promised/default lead time. Use default demand stats (backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples) to let the OR engine set base-stock and cap; this balances service level (captures recent variance via backend stats) against holding cost given low holding penalty.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/06/03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained, higher-demand regime beginning Period 14 (demands 83, 140, 112) vs prior periods (~55 avg). Lead time has been consistently 0 historically. I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (weights (1+L) appropriately). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the increased volatility in the new regime. These parameters push the OR backend to raise the base stock to meet the new higher demand while accounting for higher variability; using recent samples avoids diluting the signal with older, lower-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 (2019/05/13): prior Periods 1-13 avg demand=55.38, Periods 14-16 avg=111.67 (+101.7%)

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14: recent demands (P14-P17) = [83,140,112,62] with higher mean than prior periods. On-hand=97, in-transit=0 so we have ample coverage today but must size future orders to the new higher-demand regime. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the post-Period-14 regime (N selected = 4 = length of recent regime P14-P17, satisfies 3\u2264N\u226420). Use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to the new higher mean and its recent variability while keeping holding costs in mind given current ample on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=0 and a clear demand regime shift starting Period 14 (recent higher demand). I set L to default (promised 0) since arrivals have consistently concluded same-period. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 14-18 average ~95.6/week); sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias orders upward to meet the sustained post-Period-14 demand while keeping holding exposure controlled by the OR cap and profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent 0-period lead time; demand regime increased starting Period 14 (higher mean since P14). No overdue/lost shipments visible. Set L by calculating observed lead-times (will be 0). For demand and volatility use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 14-19) to capture the new high-demand regime (sustained elevated average ~112). This raises mu_hat to meet the higher service requirement while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; keeps holding risk controlled given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 and a past demand regime shift at Period 14. Current on-hand=54, in-transit=0; recent sales (Periods 17-20) = [62,81,84,86], recent mean=78.25. I use promised lead time (default L=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to capture the latest post-shift demand level and volatility so the OR backend targets inventory for current realized demand rather than older pre-shift samples.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand regime shift detected at Period 14 (post-shift avg \u2248112 vs pre-shift \u224855). To protect service during the higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised=0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the 8 most recent post-changepoint samples (Periods 14\u201321), capturing the sustained higher mean and recent variability; this raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the OR backend's q-based safety factor.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (avg P1-13=55.38 vs P14-16=111.67). Recent periods (P14\u2013P22, 9 periods) reflect the new higher-demand regime; I therefore set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N for demand parameters using the 9-period post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean and recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the confirmed higher demand while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

To reflect the higher recent demand I set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N based on the post-change regime (Periods 14-23, length=10) so mu_hat uses recent_N N=10 and sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10. This biases the OR backend toward the higher recent mean and recent volatility, improving service while keeping holding cost explicit in the backend formula. No evidence of new lead-time or regime changes this period.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time=0 (Period 5 insight) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (2019-05-13) where average demand roughly doubled. Recent demand since the changepoint (Periods 14-24) is the most relevant for forecasting. I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 14-24) to capture the new higher-demand regime while keeping enough samples to stabilize estimates. This raises mu_hat to cover (1+L) periods at the new mean and increases sigma_hat to reflect post-changepoint variability, helping the OR backend balance higher service-level needs against holding cost.

Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=59, in-transit=0; no arrivals outstanding. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1-25 all arrived same period). Demand regime shifted up at Period 14 and has been stable since; use recent data to capture current regime. Set L to default (promised = 0). For demand and volatility use recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent 5 weekly demands to reflect post-shift regime while keeping N within 3-20). This balances service (capture higher recent mean) vs holding cost by not over-reacting to single-week spikes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows on-hand=38, in-transit=0. Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (2019/05/13) with average demand roughly doubling vs prior periods. I set L=default to use the promised (and observed) 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14-26 inclusive, regime length=13) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the higher-demand regime. This raises the base-stock to protect service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while avoiding excessive stock from older low-demand data.

Demand regime increased ~+102% starting Period 14 (2019-05-13); recent post-change data should drive forecast. To prioritize service for the higher regime while controlling holding cost, use L=default (promised 0).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=64, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (carry-over). Recent demand has settled below the brief spike around Periods 14-16; last 12 concluded demands (P17-P28) average 76 units. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=12) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower post-spike regime and L=default to use the confirmed 0 promised lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (Periods 1-29 concludes). Demand regime shifted higher starting Period 14 (sustained through recent weeks). To capture the post-shift demand profile I use recent_N=16 (Periods 14-29) for both demand mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects the higher regime while keeping L at promised/default=0 to match observed deliveries.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (Periods 1-30 arrivals same-day). Demand regime shifted up around Period 14 (carry-over). Recent demand (Periods 21-30) averages moderate ~70\u201390/week after the spike. I therefore use promised/default lead time (0) and base the demand forecast on the most recent 10 weeks to capture the current post-spike regime while smoothing short noise. Using recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat helps the OR engine size base-stock for current variability and avoids overreacting to the earlier spike; this balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by limiting excess inventory while covering expected demand.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained P1\u2013P31 evidence) and a demand regime shift starting Period 14 (mean roughly doubled). To capture the post-shift demand level and recent volatility, I use recent_N across the post-changepoint regime (Periods 14\u201331, length 18). This lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the most relevant data while keeping L at the promised/default 0 to reflect observed 0-period arrivals.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent history shows confirmed zero lead time (periods 1-32 all concluded with lead_time=0) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (2019-05-13) where mean demand roughly doubled. Current on-hand=76, in-transit=0. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher sustained demand; regime length from P14-P32 = 19, so N=19. Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the recent higher mean and volatility to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (Periods 1-33). Demand regime shift at Period 14 is already recorded; recent weekly demand (last 5 concluded weeks: P29-33 = 59,78,49,40,56) averages ~56.4, reflecting current lower post-peak demand. To keep service while limiting holding cost, use promised/default lead time and base forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the post-spike regime. Chosen methods: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to set (1+L)*mean over last 5 samples; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

Recent weekly demand has fallen from the mid-year spike; last weeks show lower demand (Periods 31-34: 49,40,56,37). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, I use recent_N estimates (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects the current lower regime rather than the mid-year spike.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Past concluded history confirms lead time = 0 (Period 5 evidence) and a sustained demand regime jump around Period 14; however recent weekly demand has fallen relative to that mid-year spike. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 observed demands: P31-35 = 49,40,56,37,30; recent average ~42.4) to capture the current lower-demand regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters lower the base-stock to avoid excess holding costs given high holding cost sensitivity (profit $19, hold $1) while still covering (1+L) periods of expected demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show stable same-day arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed earlier). Recent demand (Periods 31-37: 49,40,56,37,30,35,36) averages ~40/week, well below the elevated regime seen after Period 14. To reflect the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility, set L=default to use promised lead time (0). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 7 weeks, keeping orders aligned to the current lower demand and avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 across many periods). Recent demand has fallen from the mid-year spike: last 8 demands (Periods 31-38) = [49,40,56,37,30,35,36,37], recent average \u224835. To reflect the current lower regime while keeping lead-time as confirmed, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent low-demand regime and reduce excess holding vs stockouts.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time persistently 0). Recent demand (Periods 34-39 = 37,30,35,36,37,36) indicates a lower, stable regime since late Sep. I set L=default to use promised lead time 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to forecast based on the most recent stable 6-week demand pattern (scale = (1+L)\xd7mean). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture recent volatility. These choices keep inventory responsive to the current low-demand regime while leveraging confirmed 0 lead time to avoid excess holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclues show lead time confirmed as 0 and a prior demand regime shift (Periods 14-16 spike) but demand has since settled lower in recent weeks. To target current demand level and avoid excess holding, set lead time to promised (default=0) and forecast using the most recent 5 weeks (captures current settled mean/volatility). This balances service (use short LT) vs holding cost by sizing base stock to recent demand rather than the earlier spike.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 (confirmed P1\u2013P41). Demand shows earlier regime shift up in May (Periods 14\u201316), but recent weeks (Periods 34\u201341) exhibit a lower, stable demand (~30\u201356/week). To avoid overstock given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), I use recent demand samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets current lower regime while keeping service high. L uses default (promised=0) because concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. Selected recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent ~2 months of weekly demand (conservative N between 3\u201320) so base_stock reflects current demand and limits holding cost given low holding penalty.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods (carry-over). A sustained demand regime shift occurred starting Period 14; recent demand has been the new regime. Given current zero inventory and high service target (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95), use recent data from the post-changepoint regime to size the replenishment. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent stable regime (cap N at 20 as per rules). This balances service (high fill rate) against holding cost by sizing base-stock from recent mean and volatility under the confirmed lead time.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1-43 arrivals all same-period). Demand regime shift was previously recorded (Periods 14-16 spike), but recent weeks show lower demand. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations (recent mean ~43 units/week) so the OR backend targets an appropriate short-run base stock and avoids excess holding given holding cost and current low pipeline. No evidence of lost shipments to adjust lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Promised lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over. Recent weekly demand (Periods 40-44 = 56,34,66,38,32) shows a downshift from the mid-year spike; to avoid excess holding ahead of holiday clearance while preserving service, I use a short-window recent demand estimate. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the base-stock to the most recent regime and reduce overstating demand from earlier high months.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1-P45). Recent demand (Periods 41-45 = 34,66,38,32,33) averages ~40.6, indicating no sustained regime shift since the May increase. To reflect current lower recent demand entering the holiday week and keep safety modest, use L=default (promised 0), mu_hat based on recent_N to focus forecast on the last 5 periods, and sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (using recent demand) and holding cost (avoids overstock given limited on-hand and no in-transit).

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed previously). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift beginning Period 14; use recent data to reflect the higher post-change mean/volatility. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent 20 weeks of demand (reflecting the post-shift regime while smoothing older history). This raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while the high profit:holding ratio (q\u22480.95) keeps service-level driven z high; using recent samples limits overreaction to short-term noise.
