Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (50,38,43,60,43) give mean \u224846.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals exist, so no evidence of delayed or lost shipments or lead-time change. No sustained demand regime change (only 5 consistent weekly samples). Use default promised lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples to let the OR engine compute base stock from full-sample mean/variance.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand samples mean = 46.8 (samples: 50,38,43,60,43). Period1 order arrived with observed lead_time=0 (one observation). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent sold 47 matches historical mean. No evidence of sustained regime or lead-time change. Use default lead time (promised 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, giving a base-stock anchored to historical average while avoiding overfitting to a single period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded lead times for SKU 685813005 are both 0 (Period1 and Period2), so I set L to the calculated average (0). Demand shows a sharp uptick in the last two concluded periods (51 -> 97) vs. earlier Jan samples (50,38,43,60,43). This is suggestive but not yet a 3+ period sustained shift, so I avoid explicit recent_N that could overfit. I use an EWMA (gamma=0.5) for mu_hat to bias the (1+L)-period demand forecast toward recent higher demand while retaining historical weight. sigma_hat remains default to let the backend compute volatility from full sample set. These choices increase target base-stock to improve service for the recent spike while keeping variance estimation conservative given limited evidence of a sustained regime change.

Daily Profit: $58.00, Daily Holding Cost: $16.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $42.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows demand samples (periods with sales): 51,97,58 and historical weekly samples for forecasting: [50,38,43,60,43] (mean=46.8). On-hand=16, in-transit=0 so available stock covers ~0.34 of one-period demand; no overdue arrivals pending. All three concluded periods report arrival lead_time=0 \u2014 strong evidence actual lead time is 0. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to confirm 0, and use default demand moments so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect baseline weekly demand (conservative given recent spikes but not yet a sustained regime change). sigma_hat default uses std of all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These parameters keep service level aligned with profit/holding parity while avoiding excess holding given limited on-hand and no pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical demand samples (50,38,43,60,43) give mean \u224846.8. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (arrivals matched orders P1\u2013P4). Profit and holding cost equal, so target service level ~50%; use default demand/volatility estimators and promised lead time to let OR backend compute base stock balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed) and no in-transit stock; on-hand=25. Historical weekly demand samples (50,38,43,60,43) average ~46.8. No evidence of a regime change (demand has varied but no sustained shift over 3+ periods). Use promised/default lead time to reflect confirmed 0-day arrivals and let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set. This balances service (base_stock set to mean demand) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5), avoiding aggressive overstocking while covering expected weekly demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P6) shows arrivals each period with observed lead time 0 and stable but variable weekly demand (demands: 51,97,58,44,29,37). On-hand=15, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0 and confirmed arrivals historically, using a lead-time estimate based on observed lead times preserves accuracy. No clear sustained regime shift in demand (only short fluctuations), so use default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)). These choices give the OR backend a conservative base-stock tied to full-sample demand while reflecting confirmed 0 lead time, balancing service level and holding cost for a low profit/holding ratio (profit=$1, holding=$1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan) mean=46.8, std\u22488.5. Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P7) show orders consistently arriving same period (lead time=0) and no lost shipments; demand fluctuates around historical mean with no sustained regime shift. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=0) and default demand/statistics so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level (using historical mean) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. History shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed 0 in concluded periods), recent demands (P1-P8) average ~51 units with volatility. To let the OR engine compute the replenishment target using observed demand stats and the confirmed 0 promised lead time, I use default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend will set (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost per unit.

Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=14, in-transit=0, recent demand has been elevated and variable (last 9 demands mean\u224849.56, strong week-to-week variability). No overdue shipments; historical concluded lead times confirm 0. Use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates from the recent 9-period regime to capture current mean/volatility rather than older Jan samples. This balances service (meet ~1 week demand) against holding cost given profit=holding.

Recent demand has softened (last 5 concluded demands: 37,50,44,36,18) vs earlier higher spikes; to reflect current regime I use a recent-N forecast (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the base-stock targets lower inventory and avoids excess holding given profit=holding.

This keeps service level aligned with profit=holding (q=0.5) while avoiding excess holding given low on-hand and no pipeline.

On-hand=19, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To let the OR engine use full historical statistics and the promised lead time, I choose default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use full-sample mean) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=5, in-transit=0, no recent lost shipments; prior concluded messages confirm lead time = 0. Historical sample mean (provided) = 46.8 units/week and sample std \u2248 7.63. With profit=holding, critical fractile q=0.5 so target z*=0 and base stock \u2248 mean. I therefore use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples; this keeps orders centered on historical average while avoiding extra safety stock given equal profit/holding costs and confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 0-period lead time (all observed lead_times = 0) and stable weekly demand series (historical samples 50,38,43,60,43 plus intervening periods). Given confirmed same-period arrivals and no evidence of a regime shift in demand, use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and \u221a(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps target base-stock conservative (matches observed demand) while avoiding extra holding cost from inflated safety stock.

Use default lead time (promised=0) consistent with confirmed evidence. Historical demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) give mean\u224846.8 and std\u22487.63; using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute base-stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps targets tied to long-run sample statistics while honoring the confirmed zero lead time and avoiding overreacting to recent fluctuations and holding cost parity (profit=$1, holding=$1).

On-hand=38, in-transit=0 \u2192 below expected weekly demand; no overdue shipments observed and prior concluded history confirms lead time=0. Use default lead time (promised 0, confirmed), default mu_hat to reflect full-sample mean \xd7 (1+L) and default sigma_hat for historical volatility. This keeps the OR engine aligned with observed same-period arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Recent concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and on-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean ~46.8 units/week (provided samples). Promised lead time remains valid; use default lead time so OR backend uses promised L=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from provided samples, yielding a one-period forecast that balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding. Current on-hand covers roughly one week of expected demand; keeping defaults avoids overreacting to short-term low orders in recent weeks.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

To avoid overstock given equal profit/holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), use a short recent-window forecast to reflect the new low-demand regime. Set L to promised/default (0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base_stock on the current low-demand mean and volatility, lowering orders and holding costs while maintaining service for near-term demand.

Concluded history confirms lead time = 0 (orders have arrived same period). To avoid excess holding cost with_profit=holding, I forecast based on the most recent regime: use recent_N=5 to capture the lower current demand and recent variability. L uses default (promised 0). This keeps base-stock aligned with recent demand and limits inventory buildup given no pipeline.

Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations, which focuses the base-stock on current lower demand and reduces overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

Period=2019-07-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has fallen vs earlier periods (Periods17-24 demand: 13,15,3,1,7,19,10,9 -> recent mean ~9.6). Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0. To align supply with the recent lower demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, set L=default (use promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (captures the most recent 8-week regime from Period17\u201324). This produces (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility so the OR backend targets service for the current low-demand regime and reduces holding risk while preserving service given on-hand=0.

Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over). No evidence of lost shipments or a sustained demand regime change. To let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics and the confirmed promised lead time, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the backend computes base_stock from all samples.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. Recent demand has dropped vs earlier months; on-hand=18, in-transit=0 and no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I detect a recent demand regime (Periods 19-26) with lower mean (~11 units/week). To reflect this sustained lower demand and keep holding costs minimal, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (last 8 demand periods: 3,1,7,19,10,9,23,16) so the OR engine targets ~11 units demand with matching volatility (~7.7), reducing overstock risk while preserving service.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent periods show high variability (e.g., Period 27 demand=48 exhausted inventory) but historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Therefore use promised/default lead time to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals, and default demand moments (use all samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service vs. holding cost given equal profit and holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent history shows arrivals equal orders with lead_time=0 in concluded periods (consistent same-period fulfillment). To minimize stockouts while avoiding extra holding cost given profit=holding, use promised/default lead time (0) and default demand estimates based on all available historical samples. This lets the OR backend compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples, which balances service level vs. holding cost under observed stable lead time.

To keep decisions aligned with the promised/observed immediate arrivals and let the OR engine compute base stock using full-sample stats, I select default lead time and default demand dispersion/level (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps service level/holding tradeoff calibrated by the backend given equal profit and holding costs.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed), and recent weeks show high but variable demand (several stockouts in Aug\u2013Sep). To let the OR engine compute replenishment using its demand statistics and the promised lead time, I select default lead time and default demand estimates so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (covers average demand plus safety stock) while avoiding over-specifying parameters given no new sustained regime shift.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand. Observed concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals; use L=default (promised 0). Recent demand shows a higher regime beginning Period 30 (demands 76,60,48); to respond quickly use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=3 (captures the elevated short-term demand). This raises base_stock to protect service level during the current high-demand window while the backend cap limits extreme orders; using recent_N balances profit vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand increased from 35 (Periods 27-29 avg) to 61.33 (Periods 30-32 avg) (+74%).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent data show a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 30 (Periods 30-33 high; Period 33 extreme). Lead times historically 0. To protect service during the new higher-demand regime, set lead time to promised (default) and compute demand forecast from the most recent regime using the last 4 periods to capture the shift while remaining responsive. Use matching recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level (captures demand increase) against holding cost by limiting the horizon to the recent regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (Periods 30-34 demands: 76,60,48,138,102) \u2014 higher mean and higher volatility versus earlier periods; lead time has been consistently observed as 0. Given the confirmed regime (5 periods so far), set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the last 5 samples, capturing the new elevated mean and increased variability. This raises the base stock to protect service levels after the demand jump while sigma from recent data limits overstock by reflecting current volatility.

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 and recent demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 30 (Period 30-35 demands: 76,60,48,138,102,98 \u2192 elevated). Set L using observed lead times (calculate). For demand forecast use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean: N=6 (Periods 30-35). Use same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine to a base-stock appropriate for the new, higher demand while accounting for observed lead time=0 and elevated variance, balancing service level vs holding cost.

I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms 0.

Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (regime length from Period 30\u201337 = 8) so the OR engine targets the higher recent mean and volatility rather than diluting with older low-demand history.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclues confirm sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 30 (avg \u2191 ~74%). Promised lead time is 0 and recent history shows arrivals with 0 lead time, so use default L. To capture the post-Period-30 demand regime, use recent_N for demand and volatility using the regime since Period 30. Regime length \u2248 9 periods (P30\u2013P38), so set N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the backend target the elevated mean and variance, balancing service level against $1/unit holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage; no overdue arrivals. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 30 (post-shift weekly demand much higher). I set L=default (promised lead time 0, confirmed by concludes). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 30-39 form the post-change regime, length=10) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 demands, and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 10 demands; this focuses the forecast on the new, higher-demand regime and reduces stockouts while controlling holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0; no overdue shipments. Demand shifted up around Period 30 and recent weeks (P33-P40) show elevated weekly demand (many weeks ~70-100). I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses last 11 demand samples from the confirmed higher regime) so base_stock reflects current elevated demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=11 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices prioritize service in the sustained higher-demand regime while using recent volatility to limit excessive holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed historically). Demand increased materially starting Period 30; using the post-change regime (Periods 30-41) to forecast. I set L=default to keep promised lead time 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (Periods 30-41 mean demand=88) so the base-stock targets the higher, sustained demand regime and avoids stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 30 (carry-over insight already recorded). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time is 0 and concluded arrivals historically confirm L=0. To bias the OR backend toward the recent higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime samples. I choose N=13 (Periods 30\u201342 length) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 13 demands) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 13 demands). This gives the OR engine a demand forecast reflecting the sustained uplift, improving service (sales/profit) while the cap still limits extreme orders to control holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (carry-over confirmed). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 30 (sustained increase); to capture the post-changepoint demand level I use recent data from that regime. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=14 to cover the 14-period high-demand regime (Periods 30-43) so the base-stock reflects the new mean. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to the sustained higher demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Demand has shifted upward since Period 30; recent 5-week demand (Periods 40-44) averages ~128 units/week (74,86,299,75,106) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime and elevated volatility. With LT confirmed 0, I keep L at promised (default) so arrivals occur same period as ordered. I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent increased variability. This raises the base-stock to improve service during the high-demand season while sigma_hat increases safety stock to balance holding cost and stockouts given profit=holding= $1.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0; recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 30 (recorded previously). Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting backend incorporate the long-run elevated demand while preserving standard volatility estimate. This avoids overfitting to single-week fluctuations and leverages confirmed L=0.

I keep L as default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent six observations so the OR engine responds to the new higher demand level and current volatility while avoiding over-reaction to single extreme spike (299).
