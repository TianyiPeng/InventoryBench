Historical weekly demand samples: [270,196,180,187,137] (mean=194) showing a downward drift toward Feb. OR recommended 235 units using its capped base-stock (assumes stationarity and promised L). Reasoning: with profit $4 and holding $1 q=0.8 \u2192 OR builds a sizable safety stock; however recent 3 samples (196,180,187 then 137) indicate lower demand in latest weeks (~137 last week) so OR likely overestimates near-term demand. Risk tradeoffs: over-ordering raises holding cost $1/unit/period; under-ordering loses $4 profit per unit unsold opportunity. Given lack of confirmed lead-time shortening/lengthening (no conclude evidence) and declining demand, I reduce OR's order moderately to avoid excess holding while still covering expected demand plus safety.

Holding cost is $1/period vs profit $4, so over-ordering is costly relative to demand uncertainty. Given confirmed L=0 (no pipeline delay) and healthy on-hand (116 units can cover at least one period at current observed demand), I trim the OR recommendation to be conservative: place a modest replenishment of 50 units to keep availability while limiting holding costs if the low-demand pattern persists.

Inventory: on-hand = 2, in-transit = 0. OR recommended 120 units based on historical high-demand data; that ignores the confirmed very-low demand regime and would create large holding cost ($1/unit/period).
