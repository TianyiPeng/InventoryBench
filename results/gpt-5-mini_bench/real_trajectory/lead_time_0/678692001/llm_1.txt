No on-hand or in-transit stock and supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unknown; no concluded arrivals to infer delays. To cover the upcoming demand while avoiding excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) I target roughly the recent 3-week average (~168). Given uncertainty and that ordering too little causes lost sales (missed $4/unit profit) while holding costs are modest, place an order of 170 units to meet expected period demand once (covers L+1 assuming short lead time) without building large excess inventory.",
