Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 695632002 has zero on-hand and zero in-transit. Historical weekly demand samples (early 2019) show moderate demand (162,139,126,85,138). No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet, and no sustained regime change detected. Use promised lead time (default=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all samples' mean and std (scaled by 1+L). This balances service (covering expected weekly demand) with holding cost given limited information.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Last period an order (154) placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (arrived=154, lead_time=0). Current on-hand=41, in-transit=0 \u2014 limited cover vs. recent weekly demand. Historical weekly samples mean = 130 units; no sustained changepoint in demand or lead time (only one observed arrival). Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows two orders arrived with lead_time=0 (Period1 and Period2), so promised lead time appears reliable. Demand has stepped up recently (113 then 144) vs. older Jan samples; to adapt to this short recent uptick I use recent_N=3 for mean and volatility so the forecast emphasizes the most recent regime while remaining robust. These parameters aim to set base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of demand with a modest safety buffer given profit/holding tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $584.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded demand shows a rising three-period pattern (113, 144, 174). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current period demand plus safety. Lead time observed in Period 1-3 conclues is 0 (orders arrived same period). To respond to the recent upward shift while keeping variance estimation local, I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the current higher demand; L uses default (promised lead time=0) consistent with observed arrivals. This balances higher service needs from increased demand vs. holding cost by tightening estimates to the most recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: recent avg demand=143.7 vs historical sample avg=130 (+10.5%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $580.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019/3/11). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical samples mean=130 (2019-01), recent concluded demands show elevated demand (Periods 1-4 demands: 113,144,174,150) consistent with prior carry-over note of a +10.5% regime shift. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1-4) show lead_time=0, so set L using observed average. To protect service vs holding given higher recent demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (captures the upshift while limiting noise).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (Periods 1-5). Recent demand (Periods 1-5) shows a higher regime vs older sample; use recent window to capture elevated mean and variance. No overdue shipments detected. Choices: L=default to use promised lead time (0) since concluded data confirms 0; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 periods demand and react to the sustained higher demand; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to improve service while acknowledging holding cost via backend cap.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical base samples mean=130 but recent periods show a higher regime (~144\u2013145). Promised lead times have all concluded as 0 so use calculated observed lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime while still smoothing noise, use recent_N=6 for demand mean and volatility (covers the most recent six observed demand periods). These parameters raise target base-stock to improve service given profit/holding tradeoff while keeping variability estimated from recent data.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. Observed concluded history shows actual lead time consistently 0 (arrivals same-period P1\u2013P7). Recent demand (Periods 1\u20137) is elevated vs the original historical sample. I set L to default (promised 0). For forecasting I use recent_N with N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (last 7 periods mean \u2248149.7). This raises the base-stock to better meet service while sigma from recent data controls safety stock to limit holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 continuing through Period 7: recent avg=149.7 vs historical sample avg=130 (+15.2%), sustained 7 periods

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean=130 (from Jan samples) but recent 7-period regime shows elevated demand (carry-over: recent avg\u2248149.7, sustained 7 periods). Promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0, so use default L to keep backend assumption. To capture the sustained demand uplift, set mu_hat to recent_N with N=7 ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 periods). Use recent_N N=7 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to improve service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while backend caps orders using its cap formula to limit excess inventory given holding cost $1/unit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0, so use default promised L=0. Recent demand has shown a sustained upward regime (Periods 1\u20137 avg ~149.7 vs sample avg 130). To capture this sustained shift, set demand forecast using recent_N with N=7 (captures the 7-period regime). Use sigma recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise target base stock to cover the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

On-hand=77, in-transit=0; promised lead time observed as 0 in concluded history (orders arriving same period). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set lead time to default (promised=0) and use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the most recent 7 periods, improving service while controlling holding cost given available on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods \u2014 use promised lead time. Demand has shown a sustained higher regime through Periods 1\u20137 (previous insight) but recent weeks (Periods 5\u201311) remain variable; to capture the recent regime while smoothing noise I use the last 7 demand samples for forecasting (N=7). This sets mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect recent mean and volatility across the (1+L) review+lead window, balancing service level (protecting against the elevated recent mean) against holding cost given current inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P12 all arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand appears elevated vs original sample and a sustained higher regime was observed through Period 7; more recent periods (P8\u2013P12) remain moderately high and variable. I choose L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime observed in the first 7 periods of the series while still reflecting recent variability (N=7 satisfies regime-length rules). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run sample std. These parameters steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to preserve service (profit > holding cost) while keeping volatility-driven safety stock limited to recent behavior.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so use promised lead time. Recent demand shows a sustained elevated regime (carry-over insight: avg up ~15% through Period 7); to keep service with low pipeline I use recent data to forecast demand and volatility. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures the most recent sustained regime while respecting the N selection rules). This raises the base-stock to cover the higher recent mean while sigma_hat from recent variability tightens safety stock relative to older samples, balancing profit-driven service vs. holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime documented in carry-over (Periods 1\u20137 recent avg 149.7 vs sample avg 130, +15%). On-hand=15, in-transit=0; no overdue or missing shipments visible in concluded history (all past orders arrived with lead_time=0). I keep L at promised (default) because concluded messages consistently show lead_time=0. To capture the sustained elevated demand I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat on the most recent regime: N=7 (captures the 7-period sustained higher average). I leave sigma_hat as default (use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) since variance has not shown a clear sustained shift. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service under higher demand while not inflating safety stock from an unclear variance change; using promised L avoids overcompensating for lead-time uncertainty absent evidence.

Period 16 (2019/05/27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime vs the original samples (carry-over noted through Period 8); to capture recent regime I use recent_N=7 for demand mean and volatility, which targets the most recent sustained regime while keeping N within the regime length. This increases base_stock to favor service (profit>holding) while sigma_recent inflates safety stock modestly. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 historically, so use promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 9-16) averages ~143.25, above historical sample mean (130), indicating a modest upward shift; use a recent_N forecast to capture this regime. Sigma set to recent_N to reflect current volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the higher recent demand while avoiding overstock given holding cost > 0.

Recent demand (Periods 9-16) shows a sustained higher regime: mean = 143.25 (8 periods). To reflect the sustained regime while keeping lead-time aligned with observed arrivals, set L to default (promised lead time=0) and use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the last 8 weeks' mean and volatility (captures the +~10% uplift vs original samples) for the base-stock calculation.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen sharply: Periods 16-18 demands = 117, 100, 87. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because all observed conclude messages show 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new lower-demand regime (1+L times mean of last 3 periods \u2248101.3 units) so the OR backend reduces target inventory and avoids excess holding cost. I set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the reduced recent volatility. These choices respond to a sustained 3-period drop in demand while relying on the backend's capped ordering rule to limit order size.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16 continuing through Period 18: avg demand Periods 16-18 = 101.33 vs historical sample avg = 130 (-22.1%), sustained 3 periods

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded messages show lead_time=0). Recent demand has softened: Periods 17-19 demands = 100, 87, 79 (recent avg ~88.7), a 31% drop vs historical sample mean (130). This drop is short but recent and directly relevant for the next (L+1) periods. To adapt quickly to the lowered demand while avoiding excess holding cost, I choose L=default (use promised lead time 0) and use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the last 3 observed demands, reducing target base-stock and cap compared to using the long-run mean.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has trended lower (Periods 16-20 demands = 117,100,87,79,49); to avoid overstock I use a recent window. Set L=default to trust promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the latest low-demand regime over the last 5 periods). This reduces target base-stock and volatility estimates versus long-run averages, balancing service level with holding cost given limited on-hand stock and no pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has trended down from earlier spikes; last 7 period demands (P15-P21) average ~97 units/period, suggesting a lower short-run mean than the long-run sample. On-hand=44, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; with promised LT=0 and all concluded history showing LT=0, use observed lead time. Set L by averaging observed lead times to confirm 0. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime and reduce overweighting older high spikes (e.g., P15=185). This focuses orders to cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean, limiting holding cost given current on-hand and reduced demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Recent on-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical samples show earlier avg~130, but demand has fallen since Period 16. Periods 16-22 demands = [117,100,87,79,49,64,55], recent avg \u224878.71 (roughly -39% vs historical). All concluded lead-times=0 so use promised lead time. I set L to default (promised=0). To avoid overstock given the sustained lower demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures regime P16\u2013P22). This biases the base-stock and cap downward to reduce holding cost while preserving service for the new lower-demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=22, in-transit=0 so current coverage is low; with promised lead time 0 arrivals occur same period but will only be visible next conclude. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (historical concluded lead_time=0). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=8 => Periods 16-23) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent low-demand window, reducing suggested orders and limiting holding costs while preserving service for the new regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Observed lead times have been consistently 0 in concluded history, and recent demand has fallen vs. historical (sustained lower regime since ~Period 16). To avoid overstock while matching the recent lower demand, use promised lead time (default=0) and base forecasts on the most recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the seven-period low-demand regime (reduces order quantities vs. historical mean). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent lower variability. This reduces holding cost risk while maintaining service for the current lower-demand environment.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show all orders with lead_time=0 consistently, so set L by calculating observed lead times. Recent demand has fallen materially vs early samples; last 5 demand observations (Periods 21-25: 64,55,78,47,58) average ~60.4 \u2014 I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid overstocking. Volatility likewise estimated from the same recent window (recent_N N=5). These parameters bias the OR engine toward a lower base-stock appropriate for the sustained downturn, reducing holding cost while preserving service given current low on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Promised lead time = 0 and concluded history shows every observed arrival had lead_time=0 (no evidence of lead-time drift). Recent demand showed a sustained low regime through Period 22 (carry-over recorded earlier) but Periods 23-26 = [78,47,58,127] are mixed with a single high week (P26). To balance service (profit $4 vs holding $1 => target quantile q=4/(4+1)=0.8) while responding to recent downward regime and the noisy rebound in P26, I use a recent-window estimate to emphasize recent demand (captures potential regime). Choose N=8 to include the most recent two-month window (Periods 19-26) so the forecast reflects the low-mid recent demand but still includes the spike at P26. Sigma is also set from the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. L uses default (promised lead time=0). This keeps orders responsive to recent demand and avoids overstocking given holding cost and recent downward trend.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible in Period 27 conclude. Recent demand shows a mixed signal: a prolonged low-demand regime (Periods 16-22 avg ~78.7) but a pickup in the last two periods (P26=127 sold limited by stock, P27=116 sold limited by stock). To balance service and holding cost I keep promised lead time (L=default) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. I set demand estimates using the most recent N=5 samples to capture the recent uptick while still reflecting the short-term variability. sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices aim to raise the target base-stock modestly to avoid stockouts seen in P26\u2013P27 while limiting excess inventory if the low regime resumes.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods -> use promised lead time (default). Recent demand has been volatile last 5 weeks (P24-28 demands = 47,58,127,116,76); to capture this short-term regime and recent demand spike at P26-27, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5. This balances higher service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while reflecting recent variability so OR backend raises target inventory without overstating long-term mean.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show all prior orders arrived with lead_time=0 consistently (no evidence of delayed or lost shipments). Recent demand is variable and no new sustained regime (3+ periods) is detected since prior carry-overs. To remain robust to past shifts but avoid overfitting short blips, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean=130. Concluded arrivals through Period 30 show all orders had lead_time=0 (consistent), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 24-30) = [47,58,127,116,76,86,108], recent 7-pt avg \u2248 88.3 \u2014 lower than historical mean, indicating sustained lower-demand regime since Period 16 (captured in carry-over). To avoid overstock while maintaining service with same-day arrivals, set L=default (promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=7) to reflect the lower recent mean across the review+lead period. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=7) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce excess holding given observed drop in demand while allowing quick replenishment due to zero lead time.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and historical concludes show actual lead time=0 consistently, so no overdue shipments. I choose L=default (use promised lead time 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the latest regime (N chosen = recent regime length = 8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility rather than the older higher historical mean\u2014this reduces overstock while maintaining service given current lower demand.

Recent demand has picked up (last 5 demands: 76,86,108,154,153) \u2014 I use a recent_N=5 forecast to capture the recent uptick and short-term volatility. Using recent_N for sigma to reflect increased variability; these parameters bias the OR backend toward higher service (meet current surge) while limiting excess holding by using a short recent window.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (every concluded order shows lead_time=0). Recent demand shows an uptick, highlighted by a large observed demand in Period 33 (290) following elevated demands in Periods 29-32 (86,108,154,153). I treat the recent regime as the best short-term predictor: set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent demand level (covers weeks 29\u201333) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility including the large spike. This balances service (responding to the recent spike) against holding cost given zero pipeline and immediate delivery possibility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=33, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. Recent demand has spiked: Periods 31-34 demands = [154,153,290,192], recent mean \u2248197.25 (well above historical sample mean ~130). To raise service with minimal delay (orders arrive same period), set L=default to trust promised lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (most recent 4 weeks). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) to reflect increased volatility in these weeks. These parameters steer the OR engine to a higher base stock to reduce stockouts while accounting for higher observed variance; holding cost remains moderate so raising safety stock is justified given large profit/headroom (profit=$4, holding=$1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 31: avg demand Periods 31-34 = 197.25 vs historical sample avg = 130 (+51.7%), sustained 4 periods

Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 31 (demands P31-35 = 154,153,290,192,177; avg \u2248193.2), well above historical sample mean (130). I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded lead times =0. To capture the recent upward demand regime I use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples) and for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility; this biases the base-stock toward higher stocking to avoid stockouts during the confirmed spike while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently, so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand shows a sustained high regime since Period 31 (6 periods, demands: 154,153,290,192,177,145; avg\u2248185.17 vs historical 130, +42%). To capture the elevated demand I use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine raises base-stock and safety stock accordingly while still constrained by the backend cap; this balances higher service level (profit>holding favors higher q) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 31 continuing through Period 36: avg demand Periods 31-36 = 185.17 vs historical sample avg=130 (+42.4%), sustained 6 periods

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and a sustained demand uplift starting Period 31: avg demand Periods 31-36 = 185.17 (+42% vs historical sample mean 130), Period 37 demand=200 confirming uplift continues. With low pipeline, I want the OR engine to target the recent high-demand regime. Set L=default (promised 0, historically confirmed). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 31-36/37), so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 6 samples. This raises base-stock to protect service during the elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent samples reflects current volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 31 (sustained through Period 38). On-hand=74, in-transit=0 \u2014 low pipeline vs elevated recent demand, so boost forecast using recent regime data. Set L to default (promised lead time=0) because all concluded lead-times are 0. Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 31-38). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service during the confirmed higher-demand period while sigma_hat captures increased variability to avoid stockouts.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 31 continuing through Period 38: avg demand Periods 31-38 = 184.25 vs historical sample avg = 130 (+41.7%), sustained 8 periods

No new sustained drop/spike in the last concluded period. Use promised lead time (default=0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=8 to capture the recent high-demand regime (regime length=8). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility over same 8-period regime. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the elevated recent demand while keeping holding cost visible to the OR engine.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods. Recent demand shows a sustained high regime starting Period 31 (Periods 31-38 avg \u2248184, sustained 8 periods) with Periods 39-40 still above historical sample mean (135,166). To reflect the recent high-demand regime while keeping backend's review+lead aggregation, I set L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the 8-period high-demand regime (gives (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 samples). I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. This increases target base stock to reduce stockouts during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding risk tied to recent variability.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been elevated since Period 31 (sustained high-demand regime). On-hand=61, in-transit=0 (no overdue/lost shipments observed). Observed lead times historically are 0 each concluded period, so keep L as default (promised=0). For demand I use recent_N to capture the sustained regime beginning Period 31; regime length = 11 periods (P31\u2013P41) so N=11. Sigma set to recent_N with same N to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices raise the (1+L) demand forecast and variability to improve service during the confirmed high-demand period while the backend cap still limits extreme orders and mitigates holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 31 continuing through Period 41: avg demand Periods 31-41 = 176.27 vs historical sample avg = 130 (+35.6%), sustained 11 periods

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 31 (avg ~176/week through P41) but Period 42 had a one-off extreme spike (862 demand) likely a holiday/Black Friday outlier and not yet a sustained shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for elevated recent demand while ignoring the single extreme outlier. Set L=default (promised lead time=0, historically observed 0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 31\u201341) while diluting the single-period spike. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=11 to reflect volatility in that recent regime. These choices bias orders toward servicing the elevated post-Period-31 demand pattern while avoiding overreacting to the single large outlier, balancing service level (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 31 with a major spike at Period 42 (862) and elevated sales through Periods 36-43; on-hand=191, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for (1+L) periods ahead. Use promised lead time (default L=0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the elevated recent regime and holiday spike; choose N=8 (Periods 36-43) to balance spike sensitivity and noise. Use same recent_N window for sigma to reflect increased volatility. These settings raise the base-stock and the cap appropriately to prioritize service during the high-demand holiday while acknowledging higher holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting around Period 31 through early Dec, with a single extreme spike at Period 42 (862) but subsequent weeks remain above historical sample mean. No current confirmed lead-time deviations; all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Given elevated recent demand, use recent_N to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (capture last 11 weeks to include the autumn uplift and recent Dec weeks). This keeps orders responsive to the higher demand while sigma estimated from the same window captures recent volatility. Default lead time preserves promised 0 and avoids assuming unobserved delays.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=254, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all conclude messages show lead_time=0). Recent demand shows a holiday spike (Period 42 demand=862) followed by three weeks of elevated demand (Periods 43-45 demands=227,131,157). I set L=default to trust promised lead time 0. To capture the recent elevated regime while still smoothing volatility, I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the last 8 demand observations (Periods 38-45). This balances higher service needed from recent holiday lift against holding cost given already-high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Holiday spike at Period 42: demand=862 (one-off extreme). Subsequent sustained elevation Periods 43-45 avg=171 vs historical sample avg=130 (+31.5%), sustained 3 periods.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand = 377, in-transit = 0. Historical lead times have consistently concluded as 0 periods, so keep promised L. Recent demand includes the large holiday spike (Period 42) and subsequent variability; last 8 demand observations (Periods 39-46) show elevated mean driven by the spike and holiday-week sales. To capture recent elevated mean and higher volatility for the review+lead period, use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This reduces risk of stockouts over the immediate horizon while acknowledging high on-hand inventory will limit actual ordering by the OR cap.
