Product & calendar: SKU is denim shorts and current date is 2019-12-23 (winter/holiday) so seasonal demand for shorts is unlikely to spike. OR's recommendation (428) is driven by earlier high summer peaks and promised assumptions\u2014not reflective of recent sustained low demand. Strategy: with lead time = 0 we can replenish to meet one near-term week's demand without building large pipeline. Target a short, conservative restock to cover expected demand + small buffer: target on-hand \u224830 (\u22481.5\xd7 recent weekly demand of ~20 to allow some variability). With current 11 on-hand, order = 30 \u2212 11 = 19 \u2192 round to 20 units to keep simple. This minimizes holding cost while avoiding stockouts given current low demand and seasonality.",
