Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). Product: Ozzy Denim Shorts. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean = (46+37+48+57+57)/5 = 49.0 and std \u2248 7.58. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time is 0; with no evidence of delays or regime change and only 5 historical samples, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps base-stock tied to historical mean while avoiding overfitting given limited data. Defaults balance service level (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 high service bias) and avoid aggressive explicit inflation despite zero on-hand because no confirmed lead-time or demand shift exists.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly mean from provided samples = 49 units; Period 1 showed a single higher demand (71) but this is only one period and not a sustained regime change. Promised lead time was confirmed as 0 in Period 1 conclude (order placed in P1 arrived in P1). No evidence of lost shipments or longer lead time. Therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies its baseline base-stock with no ad-hoc adjustments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent two periods showed much higher sales (63\u219272 received, demand 71 and 148) versus historical weekly mean (~49) from Jan samples, but this is only 2 periods so not a sustained regime change. Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates based on full historical samples so the OR backend will compute base-stock from the long-run mean/volatility rather than overreacting to a short spike, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows orders arriving with lead_time=0 in Periods 1-3. On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical older weekly samples (Jan) show mean ~49, but the last three observed demands (Period1=71, Period2=148, Period3=113) indicate a sustained higher-demand regime. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed lead times (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to base mu_hat on the most recent 3 periods (captures the elevated demand regime spanning Periods 1-3). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to reflect the increased variability seen in those three periods. These choices raise the base stock to cover the current higher-demand regime while accounting for higher variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given holding cost is low relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: historical Jan mean=49 vs recent Period1-3 mean=110.7 (+125%); evidence: Period1=71, Period2=148, Period3=113 (sustained 3 periods).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1185.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent demand shifted up: Periods 1-3 demands = 71,148,113 (avg 110.7) vs historical Jan avg ~49 (carry-over recorded). Current on-hand=107, in-transit=0 \u2014 roughly one period of recent demand coverage, so risk of stockouts if demand remains elevated. Observed concluded lead_times = 0 consistently. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=0. To bias the forecast toward the new, higher regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat, so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and std from the three most recent demand samples (71,148,113) and thus increases base-stock and safety stock to reduce lost sales while holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent demand regime shift detected: Periods 1-3 (71,148,113) average=110.7 vs historical Jan mean\u224849 (+125%). On-hand=112, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments. To capture the new high-demand regime, set L by observed lead times (calculate=0). Use recent_N for demand and volatility using the most recent 3-period regime (N=3) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 demands and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 3 demands. This raises target base-stock to serve the sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost considered (profit/holding implies high service level but using recent data limits excess inventory).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical Jan samples show earlier high regime (Period1-3 avg=110.7) recorded previously, but most recent 3 concluded periods (P4-P6 demands = 68,64,82) form a sustained lower regime (mean\u224871.3 over 3 periods). All observed lead times in concluded history = 0. To respond to the recent 3-period demand regime while avoiding excess holding, set L to promised (default), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (recent_N, N=3) so the backend sizes base stock to current lower demand while capturing recent volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has shifted materially upward vs historical Jan baseline (recent weeks show many 60\u2013150 sales). On-hand and in-transit are 0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history so use default L. For demand forecasting I rely on the recent regime (use recent_N=5) to capture the elevated mean and volatility from the last 5 observed demand periods (Periods 3\u20137), which balances service against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand regime is materially higher than historical Jan samples (carry-over noted: sustained higher demand from Period1-3 onward). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover higher recent demand. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed previously arrived same period). I set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across Periods1-8 (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 demand samples). Sigma also uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet elevated demand while sigma captures variability for safety stock, balancing unit profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weekly demand has settled higher than historical Jan mean: last 5 concluded demands = [64,82,125,152,126], recent mean \u2248109.8. On-hand=37, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time and observed lead times in history are 0; use default L to keep backend assumption. To capture the recent higher demand regime identified earlier, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 5 concluded samples (N=5). This biases the base-stock toward current demand while sigma from the same window reflects recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected/overdue. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods, so keep L as default (promised 0). Demand has shifted to a higher regime (documented previously); to capture the recent higher demand pattern I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=6 (covers the most recent 6 demand observations to balance recency and sample size). These parameters will raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock for variability, trading off holding cost against lost-sales profit ($19 vs $1).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded history shows all observed lead_times = 0 (orders placed have arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no expected arrivals. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) plus the sustained higher recent regime (Periods1-11 demand spikes) indicate materially higher demand; to let the OR engine use full data and promised lead time, I select default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using all observed high-demand samples already in history) against holding cost by relying on the backend's cap and q-based z* calculation.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand is substantially higher than historical Jan baseline (recent periods show sustained high weekly demand). Lead time has been observed as 0 in all concluded periods, so use promised/default L=0. To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 6 demand samples (Periods 7-12) to reflect current weekly demand (~204 units). Match sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to service elevated demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (orders consistently arrived same period). To capture the new high-demand regime while keeping holding costs controlled, I set L to default (promised 0).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile versus historical Jan samples (recent concluded demands: P12=258, P13=155, P14=254). On-hand=117, in-transit=0 \u2014 on-hand only covers ~0.5 of recent weekly demand, so forecast should use recent high-demand regime. Lead time observations (Periods 1\u201314) all concluded as 0, so use default promised lead time. For demand forecast set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 concluded demands = ~222 units). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect current elevated volatility. These choices make the OR backend build a base stock appropriate to the recent high-demand regime while keeping lead time at the confirmed 0, balancing service level vs holding cost given holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=130, in-transit=0 so we currently hold ~0.54\xd7 one-period recent demand\u2014need to target higher base stock to avoid lost sales. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods, so use promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the new higher demand regime (captures mean and volatility over last 5 periods) which balances service (higher mu) against holding cost; sigma_hat recent_N uses the same 5-sample window.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 8\u201317) show a sustained, much higher demand regime vs historical Jan samples: recent avg \u2248233 units/week. Promised lead time historically observed as 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 10 concluded demand samples (Periods 8\u201317). This gives the OR engine demand inputs anchored to current regime (higher mean and volatility) so orders will replenish to meet elevated weekly demand while balancing holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: avg increased from historical Jan mean=49 to Period8-17 mean\u2248233 (+376%); evidence: Period8-17 demands = [152,126,206,357,258,155,254,189,344,290] (10 periods, sustained).

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=212, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period (orders placed arrived same period throughout history). Inventory is currently healthy vs recent demand; given stable confirmed lead time and existing carry-over insights about past demand regime shifts, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample. This lets the OR engine apply its capped policy with promised lead time and the full-sample demand estimates, balancing high target service level (q\u22480.95) against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 8 (Period8-17 mean\u2248233) and an extreme spike in Period 19 (demand=652) causing a stockout. Promised lead time has consistently been observed as 0 in concluded messages, so I keep L at default. To capture the sustained higher demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime window (N=10) to reflect elevated mean and variability while limiting influence of older low-Jan samples. This balances service (to avoid repeat stockouts) against holding cost by increasing target base stock and safety stock based on recent demand evidence.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted up materially since Period 8 (sustained higher regime) and the last 10 periods show elevated and more volatile demand including very large spikes in Periods 19-20. Use default lead time (promised LT=0) because concluded history consistently shows LT=0. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=10) to capture the new higher regime and recent spikes across the last 10 demands; use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect increased volatility. This balances service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than long-tailed historical low-demand periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=177, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a new, sharp upward regime starting Period19 (demands 652,812,529 over Periods19-21). Historical earlier shifts (Periods1-3 and 8-17) are noted, but most recent 3 periods are dramatically higher and sustained for 3+ periods, so forecast should prioritize the new regime. Use L=default because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current high-demand regime (review+lead demand scaled by 1+L). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect increased volatility in the latest 3 periods. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the current spike while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: avg increased from prior (~233) to Period19-21 avg=664.33 (+185%); evidence: Period19=652, Period20=812, Period21=529 (3 sustained periods).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent weeks show elevated but variable summer demand after the sustained regime shifts already recorded (Periods 1-3, 8-17, 19-21). On-hand=503, in-transit=0; with high recent demand there is sufficient on-hand to cover near-term demand but pipeline is empty. I keep L=default since all concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to focus the forecast on the most recent realized demand (Periods 20-22 = 812, 529, 395) so mu_hat reflects the current elevated but slightly declining level ((1+L)*mean of last 3). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) while using a short recent window to adapt quickly if the spike fades.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=581, in-transit=0 so all supply visible now; no overdue/lost shipments signaled. Historical Jan sample mean~49 but multiple sustained upward regime shifts have been recorded (carry-over). Recent demand (Periods 19-23 = 652,812,529,395,348) is materially higher than historical; I therefore set lead time to default (promised 0, supported by consistent concluded 0 LT observations). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (gives (1+L)*mean over last 5 weeks \u2248 547 units/week) and set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while keeping holding cost visible given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has settled at a much higher regime vs historical Jan: Period19-24 demands = [652,812,529,395,348,422], recent mean \u2248526 units/week. On-hand=438, in-transit=0 so current stock covers <1 week of recent demand; profit/holding implies high service target (q\u22480.95). I set L=default (promised 0, historically observed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained high-demand regime (6 most recent periods show consistent elevated demand). I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to a high base-stock to avoid heavy lost-sales given high profit and recent regime shift.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=579, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has shown prior regime shifts (noted in carry-over history) but no new sustained change in the last 3 concluded periods (Periods 23-25 demands = 348,422,240). Given large on-hand stock and confirmed 0 lead time, use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample. This avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations while allowing the backend's capped ordering to limit new orders against current pipeline/on-hand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has pulled back from the large mid-June/July spikes: last 3 demands = [422, 240, 112], so I treat the most recent regime as lower and volatile. On-hand=467, in-transit=0 (no arrivals expected). Promised lead time remains 0 and all concluded lead-times = 0, so use default L. To keep orders responsive to the latest downshift while preserving service, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures the last 3 weeks' mean and std across the review+lead period). This prioritizes matching immediate demand and avoids carrying excessive stock given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. On-hand=424, in-transit=0. Observed actual lead time historically = 0 (all concluded arrivals show W=0). Recent demand has retreated from the June/July peaks (Periods 19-25) to much lower volumes in Periods 26-27 (112, 91). To remain responsive while avoiding excess holding cost (holding=$1 vs profit=$19), keep L at promised (default 0) since arrivals have consistently concluded same-period. Use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to weight recent low demand more strongly while retaining memory of earlier high-demand weeks; this reduces over-ordering after a temporary drop. For sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture recent variability (including the rapid decrease) so the backend's safety stock reflects current volatility. This combination favors lower expected orders now (lower mu_hat) but keeps some buffer for volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given high profit margin.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=312, in-transit=0. Recent 3 periods (P26-28) show a sustained drop in demand to ~105 units/week vs prior high regime. No overdue shipments observed (all concluded lead_times=0 historically). To be responsive to the recent steep fall, keep L as default (promised lead time=0) so backend uses current promise. Use EWMA_gamma for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to weight the most recent low demands more and quickly reduce target base-stock; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility including some higher earlier weeks while still focusing on recent spread. This balances high service level (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95) while shrinking mean forecast promptly to avoid large holding costs if low demand persists.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg decreased from Period19-21 avg=664.33 to Period26-28 avg=105 (-84%); evidence: Period26=112, Period27=91, Period28=112 (3 sustained periods).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has settled low: Period27-29 demands = [91,112,86], recent mean \u224896.3. On-hand=278, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=0 has been consistently observed historically (all concluded lead_times = 0). No evidence of lost shipments or new sustained regime shifts. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent low-demand regime and keep ordering responsive to the current lower mean; sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) captures recent volatility. This keeps base stock aligned to current demand and limits excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=247, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Recent demand has settled into the low regime that began at Period 26: last 5 demands = [112,91,112,86,31], mean=86.4 (sustained 5 periods). Promised lead time and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so use default lead time. To align the OR engine with the recent low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the 5-period low regime). This keeps target base-stock responsive to the current lower demand while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has settled well below the earlier summer spikes: last 6 demands (Periods 26-31) = [112,91,112,86,31,26], showing a sustained lower regime since Period 26. On-hand=221, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory currently covers several weeks at the recent lower demand, so avoid large replenishment. Set L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean over last 6). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect reduced recent volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has fallen sharply (Periods 30-32: 31,26,15) but historical series contains multiple regime shifts; on-hand=206, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this period. Observed lead times historically are 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. To keep the OR backend anchored to long-run demand while allowing it to compute aggregated review+lead demand and volatility, use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances service vs holding cost given current moderate on-hand and lack of pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg decreased from prior ~105 to Period30-32 avg=24 (-77%); evidence: Period30=31, Period31=26, Period32=15 (3 sustained periods).

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent low regime I use recent_N (N=4) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 4 weeks and avoid overstocking given high holding cost relative to profit.

Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent demand has remained at the low regime detected earlier (Periods 30-34 demands = [31,26,15,29,11], avg\u224822), and all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically. On-hand is high (457) and in-transit=0, so we should forecast using the recent low-demand regime to avoid costly overstock. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime (last 5 periods). This tightens the base-stock to match current demand while the high profit/low holding cost encourages a relatively high service level via the OR backend's q, but using recent data prevents unnecessary replenishment given current on-hand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=441, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are 0 \u2192 use default promised lead time. Recent demand has stayed in the low regime since Period 30 (Period30-35 demands = [31,26,15,29,11,16], 6 periods). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime so the OR backend sizes base-stock and cap to avoid excess holding given high on-hand inventory and low holding cost trade-off vs profit.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (Period30-36 demands = [31,26,15,29,11,16,17]); on-hand=424, in-transit=0 so current inventory comfortably covers expected low demand. Historical early-year demands were much higher, but a sustained regime shift to low demand began at Period 30 (3+ periods). Lead times observed in concluded history are consistently 0. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the recent low-demand regime (Periods 30\u201336). I use the same recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock aligned to the current low-demand regime, avoiding excess future holding cost while maintaining service given ample on-hand stock.

No evidence of new upward shocks; historical lead time has consistently been 0. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting this low-demand regime, use promised lead time (default) and base forecasts/volatility estimated from the recent low-demand window (N=8). This keeps orders small and responsive if demand remains low.

To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set lead time to default (promised 0) and forecast using the recent low-demand regime (last 10 periods). Use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current low mean and volatility.

All concluded lead times = 0 historically. No overdue shipments. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained low-demand regime from Period 30 onward (regime length=11 \u2192 N=11), so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from those 11 latest samples. This keeps replenishment aligned to current low demand while the high service target (profit vs holding) is handled by the OR engine.

Use promised lead time (default L=0) because concluded history shows lead time=0 consistently. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent low-demand regime to avoid over-ordering given high on-hand: use recent_N with N=12 (captures Period30-41 regime). This reduces target base-stock to match current demand and limits holding cost while maintaining service for the observed low-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=302, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 \u2192 set L by calculate. Recent demand regime is the low post-Period30 regime: Period33-42 demands = [29,11,16,17,10,14,15,30,16,37], mean=19.5. With large on-hand buffer (302 >> expected near-term demand) I choose recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts using the current low-demand regime and avoids aggressive replenishment; L=calculate ensures promised 0 is replaced by observed 0. This balances service (keep stock to meet modest weekly demand) against holding cost by signalling low target base-stock from recent demand statistics.

No evidence of delayed/lost shipments (arrivals have matched orders historically with lead_time=0).

Demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (recent weeks: Period40-44 demands = [30,16,37,16,21], mean \u224824). To size inventory to the current low-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility, giving (1+L)-scaled forecasts focused on the most recent 5 weeks. This reduces excess holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand pattern.

Promised lead time is 0 and recent deliveries have been absent but arrivals historically match promised lead time=0. To avoid overstock while covering (1+L) periods of current low demand, use L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand and volatility to anchor to the low-demand regime (N=10 captures the sustained low-demand period), letting the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the last 10 samples.
