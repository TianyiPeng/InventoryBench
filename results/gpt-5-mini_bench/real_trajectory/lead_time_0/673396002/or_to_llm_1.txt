Historical weekly mean from provided samples = ~284 units with high sd (~114), but realized recent sales are much lower (Period1 sold=115, Period2 sold=169), suggesting a downward short-term demand realization vs. historical average. OR recommendation (146) is derived from a high base-stock (\u2248472) using the historical mean and q=0.95; its uncapped order_raw would be ~182 (base_stock \u2212 on-hand), capped to 146. Adjustment logic: because actual lead time = 0 (so orders arrive same period) and recent two-period demand is well below historical mean, I reduce OR's recommendation to avoid unnecessary holding cost while still covering expected single-period demand. Target cover: with L=0 we need to cover roughly one period ahead; using recent realized demand (~170) plus a small buffer for variability and the high profit/low holding tradeoff, I place a conservative but positive order of 100 units (below OR's 146) to replenish some stock while limiting carry cost in case low demand persists.
