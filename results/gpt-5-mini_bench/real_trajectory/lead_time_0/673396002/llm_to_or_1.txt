Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is a womens belt with weekly historical sales samples (407,374,295,130,213). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet; promised lead time used. No clear changepoint in 5-sample history, so use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility. This balances service (use full-sample mean) vs holding cost given modest holding cost relative to profit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent conclude shows Period 1 order arrived in same period (lead_time=0). On-hand=357, in-transit=0, last period demand=115 which is below historical mean. No sustained demand regime shift detected. I set L="calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (confirmed 0 so far). I choose mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the backend uses historical sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L), providing a baseline forecast and safety stock while respecting the observed 0-period lead time and avoiding overreacting to one low demand period.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded history shows two arrivals with observed lead_time=0 (P1 and P2). On-hand=290, in-transit=0. Demand history sample mean = 283.8/week; volatility ~102. Given observed lead time matches promised (0), use calculated L to let backend confirm; use default demand/volatility scaling so base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps the policy aligned with historical weekly demand while balancing profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) via the backend's service-level mapping.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly samples (Jan) show mean ~283.8, but the last 3 concluded periods (P1-P3 sales: 115,169,140) average 141.3 \u2014 a clear, sustained (~50%) downshift over 3 periods. Lead-time observed consistently as 0 in all concluded orders. I set L to calculate (use observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new lower-demand regime (applies (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect reduced recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk while keeping service given recent lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1-3: avg decreased from 283.8 (Jan samples) to 141.3 (P1-P3 concluded) (-50%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $5624.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times (P1\u2013P3) = 0 periods (arrivals same period). Period 4 showed a large demand spike (demand=314) but stockout limited sales; prior three concluded periods (P1\u2013P3) were lower (115,169,140) after the earlier Jan samples. No sustained new regime (only one high-demand period), so I keep lead time at the observed average and use recent demand to capture the elevated short-run mean and volatility. Therefore: L set by calculate (uses observed lead times, which are 0); mu_hat uses recent_N N=3 (captures latest 3 concluded demand samples to reflect the recent uptick while limiting noise from older Jan data); sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility including the spike. This balances higher service for possible elevated demand while limiting holding cost given inventory is zero and the spike is not yet confirmed as sustained.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=266, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands: P3=140, P4=314 (stockout-limited), P5=96 \u2014 overall weaker recent demand vs. Jan samples and some volatility. Observed lead times have all concluded as 0, so use promised lead time. To bias forecast toward recent lower demand while smoothing the P4 spike, I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3). Keep sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These choices aim to reduce over-ordering after the sustained drop while allowing responsiveness to shifts.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded demand (P1-P6) shows high variability: [115,169,140,314,96,134]. On-hand=200, in-transit=0 \u2014 no incoming stock visible. Multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1,P2,P3,P5,P6 arrived same period). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded data consistently confirms 0 lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime and reduce influence of earlier Jan samples and the one large spike (P4). This balances service level (captures recent demand) vs holding cost given currently healthy on-hand but no pipeline; smaller recent window avoids overstocking from older higher means.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders in Periods 1,2,3,5,6 arrived same period; conclude messages show lead_time=0).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=180, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1-3,5-7 arrived same period). Recent demand has settled below historical sample mean: last three concluded demands (P5-P7) = 96,134,130 (avg ~120). To avoid overstock while maintaining service, set lead time based on observed data and forecast demand using the most recent short-run regime (3 periods). sigma estimate will use same recent window to capture current volatility.

To prioritize recent demand patterns and restore availability quickly, use promised lead time (default L=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 concluded demand periods (P4\u2013P8) to capture the current mean/volatility for ordering.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=246, in-transit=0. Historical Jan samples mean=283.8 but recent weeks show a lower regime (recent demand roughly 100\u2013240, 5-period avg ~137). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstocking from older high-Jan mean, I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) so mu_hat reflects the current lower regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N (last 5) to capture recent volatility. L uses default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm lead time=0. This balances service (capture recent demand) against holding cost given current on-hand of 246.

L kept as default (promised=0) because conclude history confirms 0. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on current demand, reducing overstock risk while preserving service.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=190, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 for observed orders), so use calculated lead time = 0. Recent demand has stabilized lower than Jan samples; I use the most recent 5 demand periods to forecast (captures current regime: demands 130,239,87,60,53 \u2192 recent mean ~113.8). Selecting recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on current demand, reducing excess holding given low holding cost but prioritizing service with profit $19/unit. These parameters help the OR backend set a base stock appropriate to the recent lower-demand regime while reflecting low lead time and current inventory position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=173, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0. Recent demand (Periods 7-12) shows a lower, stable regime vs Jan samples; to reflect current pace I use a recent-window forecast. Set L to promised (default=0). Set mu_hat using recent_N N=6 (captures P7\u2013P12 demand average scaled by 1+L). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to current lower demand and avoids excess holding given low holding cost but limited benefit to overstocking.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent observed demand has settled well below Jan samples: last 10 concluded weekly demands (Periods 4-13) show a sustained lower regime (avg \u2248 64/week) vs. historical Jan mean 283.8. On-hand = 167, in-transit = 0, no overdue shipments visible and past concludes confirm same-period arrivals (lead_time=0). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I set lead time to default (promised=0, confirmed by prior concludes) and use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent 10 weeks. This concentrates stock on the current lower demand level, reducing holding cost while preserving service.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and demand has been lower than Jan samples; on-hand=192, in-transit=0 so no incoming units. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L) \u2014 this pairs with the high service target (q\u22480.95 given profit/holding) while avoiding manual under/over-adjustment given no new sustained demand regime since prior insight. These choices keep orders aligned with observed prompt replenishment and balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands show volatile but mostly lower demand vs. Jan historical samples; last 5 demands (Periods 11-15) = [53,67,56,76,309] (one large spike at P15). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) given sustained evidence. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to let the OR engine base the review+lead demand forecast on the most recent regime while capturing recent volatility; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. This keeps orders responsive to recent demand, limits overstock given holding cost, and avoids overstating mean from older Jan samples.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (Periods 1-16). Recent demand has spiked (Periods 15-16: 309, 376) so I bias forecast to very recent history. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to capture the last 4 demand observations (Periods 13-16) and reflect the recent high demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend targets a higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the recent surge while keeping volatility estimates current to limit excessive safety stock.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has risen (Periods 13-17 demands: 56,76,309,376,412) indicating a regime uptick; to be responsive I set lead time to promised (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent regime. L chosen as default (promised 0). mu_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture the recent higher mean demand across the review+lead period. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to improve service during the sustained recent demand spike while the low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19) justify higher stock.

Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so keep promised lead time.

Recent demand (Periods 17-21 = 412,338,533,431,385) shows a higher, sustained regime versus earlier Jan samples; I use a recent-window forecast to capture this uplift. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the last 5 observed weekly demands (captures current elevated mean and volatility), so the OR backend will raise the base-stock to protect service while capping orders per its cap formula.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-07-15. Recent demand has rebounded from the early low regime; last 8 concluded periods (P15-P22) show high and variable weekly demand (many weeks ~300\u2013533). On-hand=243, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods after decision. Lead time historically confirmed 0; use promised (default) L=0. To reflect the recent higher demand regime and its volatility I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures last 8 weeks P15\u2013P22) so the OR engine targets a base-stock tuned to current demand while capping order sizes via its cap parameter. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost.

Recent demand has been above the Jan baseline; last 5 concluded demands (P19-P23) average ~384 units/week, so I set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect current regime. Variability also appears elevated recently, so set sigma_hat recent_N=5. These choices steer the OR backend to a higher base-stock reflecting current demand while keeping lead-time at 0 to avoid overestimating pipeline needs.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201324) shows frequent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 confirmed). On-hand = 347, in-transit = 0, so we are well stocked vs recent weekly demand. To let the OR engine use promised lead time and full historical samples (including seasonal summer demand), I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the policy stable, leverages confirmed lead-time=0, and avoids overreacting to short-term demand noise while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Demand recent 5-week mean (P21-25 demands = 385,296,275,210,159) ~265 units; use recent_N=5 to capture current regime vs older Jan samples. Use same recent_N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep (1+L)\xd7forecast aligned with current demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=233, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1-26) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=0). Recent demand has been stable with no new sustained regime shift since prior insight. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR engine aligned with confirmed same-period arrivals, avoids overreacting to short fluctuations, and balances service level vs. holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. On-hand=230, in-transit=0. Recent concluded weekly demand (Periods 16-27) shows sustained moderate-to-high demand (many weeks 150-533, typical recent weekly average ~270). Promised lead time has been reliably observed as 0 historically. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). To capture the most recent demand regime and avoid Jan-sample bias, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=12 (uses the last 12 concluded demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=12 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices focus the OR backend on the current demand regime, maintaining service while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently show lead_time=0 (confirmed). Recent demand (Periods 19\u201328) has been elevated and more volatile vs. early-year samples; to capture the recent regime I base demand forecasts on the most recent 10 concluded weeks. I keep L=default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=10) so the OR backend uses the (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility from the latest high-demand regime, improving service while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit. No overdue shipments observed.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 (sustained). Demand history shows variable weekly sales with recent high peaks but no new sustained regime change since prior insights. Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this yields a base-stock balancing profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1) without overfitting to recent spikes. Defaults also avoid underordering given zero pipeline and same-period arrivals.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand (Periods 23-30) shows substantially higher and more volatile weekly demand (many weeks >200, several >400). To protect service with low holding cost ($1 vs profit $19) and observed same-period arrivals, I set lead time based on observed history and base demand estimates on the most recent regime: use recent_N over the last 8 weeks to capture the elevated mean and volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock while keeping cap logic. This balances high profit (favor stocking) against holding cost and uses confirmed lead-time=0 evidence.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16. On-hand=208, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2014 continue using promised lead time. Recent demand has risen vs earlier in-year lull; last 5 concluded demands (P27-31) average ~406/week, so I use recent_N=5 to capture current higher regime for both mean and volatility. Using L=default (0) keeps forecast horizon minimal; mu_hat recent_N=5 scales (1+L)\xd7mean to match current demand; sigma_hat recent_N=5 captures recent variability and supports the backend base-stock and cap calculations to balance service level (high profit $19) against holding cost $1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=358, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 (sustained). Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: P28-P32 = 422,544,491,354,257) is materially above the long-run sample mean, so I bias the demand forecast to recent behavior to avoid stockouts. Set L to promised (0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent high mean demand, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level (avoid lost sales) versus holding cost given profit >> holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (multiple concluded messages); keep promised/default L. Recent demand (Periods 26-33) shows higher, variable weekly demand versus the Jan baseline; to capture the recent regime I use recent_N with N=8 (balanced window: \u22653, \u226420) so mu_hat reflects the last 8 weeks' mean scaled by (1+L) and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to maintain service while keeping holding cost in mind given current on-hand=231 and no in-transit.

Recent demand (last several months) is higher and more variable than the early Jan samples, so I bias forecasts toward recent history. Set L=default (promised lead time 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the recent demand regime (last ~20 concluded periods) so the OR engine replenishes to meet elevated recent demand while keeping holding costs moderate.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0). Recent demand (many weeks of elevated weekly sales through Sep\u2013Oct) is best captured by using a recent-window estimate: use recent_N=20 to compute mu_hat (covers the most recent 20 demand samples) and sigma_hat (volatility) to reflect current regime and reduce influence of early low-Jan samples. This balances service (profit $19) against holding cost $1 by sizing base stock to recent realized demand and variability, avoiding overreaction to old low-demand periods while keeping safety stock for observed variability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. On-hand=371, in-transit=0. Historical base samples (Jan 2019) mean=283.8; subsequent concluded periods show typical weekly demand variability but no new sustained regime change since prior carry-overs. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. I select L=default to use promised lead time (0). I select mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (keeps target service level high given profit/holding ratio). I select sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples for safety stock sizing. These conservative defaults prioritize service level given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) and the confirmed zero lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=377, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) across many periods; no evidence of new lost shipments. Recent demand history displays the previously recorded regime shift (lower mean) and then stable weekly variation. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand statistics, I select default methods so backend uses promised L=0 and the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use full history) and holding cost given a healthy on-hand position.

No new sustained demand regime or lead-time shifts detected. I choose L=default to reflect promised (and historically confirmed) 0-period lead time so arrivals are same-period; mu_hat=default to use the full-sample mean (1+L)*mean=283.8, giving the OR engine the long-run demand anchor; sigma_hat=default to reflect long-run demand variability. This balances service level (use established mean) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory and confirmed fast replenishment.

Recent demand (most recent ~20 periods) shows a steady lower-demand regime vs early-year spikes; to align the OR engine with current demand and avoid excess holding cost I set lead time to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples, improving service-level targeting while capping inventory growth.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=343, in-transit=0. Historical conclustions show actual lead time confirmed at 0 periods (multiple conclude messages). Recent demand has been stable through Nov (periods 39-42 demands: 96,71,72,122). Profit/holding ratio implies high service target (q=19/(19+1)=0.95). I therefore use the promised/default lead time (0) and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from full history (default) so base-stock and caps reflect long-run mean/variance while honoring the confirmed zero lead time. No new sustained demand or lead-time changepoint detected that requires recording or explicit parameter overrides.

Historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=0 (Periods 1-44 arrivals same period) and prior analysis recorded a sustained demand drop early in the run; no new changepoint observed in recent weeks. Profit/holding imply a high service quantile (q\u22480.95) so use the backend defaults: promised lead time and full-sample demand moments. This keeps base-stock sizing aligned with long-run demand estimates while avoiding overreacting to short fluctuations and respects zero observed lead time.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=239, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in many periods arrived same period). Recent demand shows an uptick in the last 3 weeks (Periods 43-45: 93,129,216 \u2192 mean ~146) so I bias the forecast to recent demand. Choose L=calculate to confirm the observed lead time (0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent demand rise across the review+lead period. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the target base-stock to meet short-term higher demand while sigma reflects recent variability; this balances service level (reducing stockouts during the current spike) against holding cost given strong evidence of same-period lead time.

Historical conclude messages (Periods 1-46) consistently show actual lead time = 0; recent demand has some December spikes but no sustained regime change beyond previously recorded shift. Profit=19, holding=1 implies a high service target (q\u22480.95). I keep L at the promised/default (0) using all historical samples for demand and volatility so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap with the full data; this leverages the confirmed 0 lead time and avoids overfitting recent noise while letting the backend produce the high service-level order recommendation.
