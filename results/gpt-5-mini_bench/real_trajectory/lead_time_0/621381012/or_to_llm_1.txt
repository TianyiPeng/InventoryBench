{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders consistently arrived same period). Inventory: on-hand = 97, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand (Periods 42\u201346, after the high-sell summer) is low: 75 (stockout), 20, 29, 26, 27 with the last four averaging ~25.5/week; current seasonal timing (late Dec) and recent five-week pattern indicate demand near ~25\u201330, not the earlier high regimes OR relies on. OR recommended 59 using long-run/higher-demand stats; that would push ending inventory much higher and incur holding cost $1/unit while marginal expected additional sales are small. With L=0 we only need to cover one upcoming period at decision time: 97 on-hand already comfortably covers expected ~30 demand. Therefore I reduce the OR recommendation to 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding cost while still meeting expected demand. No lost shipments or lead-time surprises to adjust for.",
