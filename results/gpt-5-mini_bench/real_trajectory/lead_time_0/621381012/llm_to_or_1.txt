Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward trend (0,24,29,37,41) leading into current period. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current demand and anticipated rise. Promised lead time will be used (method: default) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. For demand I select recent_N (N=5) to let the OR backend weight the evident upward shift across all available samples (captures trend while using all data). Volatility uses default to let backend scale std over (1+L). This balances service (higher mu_hat from recent data) against holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and healthy profit ($19).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-14: last 4-week avg=32.75 (24,29,37,41) vs initial week 0; sustained increase over 4 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-14 (recent 4-week avg = 32.75). On-hand=16, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time observed in Period 1 concluded as 0; use observed lead time. Set L by averaging observed lead times. For demand, use recent_N=4 to capture the new higher regime (weeks with 24,29,37,41). Use sigma recent_N=4 to reflect current volatility. These choices keep base stock aligned to the new regime while avoiding overweighting the initial zero-demand week.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples show a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-14 (recent 4-week avg=32.75) and Period 2 had a one-off high demand (58) but not yet sustained. Observed concluded lead times = 0 (Period1 and Period2 arrivals had lead_time 0). I choose L by calculation (average observed lead times=0) so backend uses actual observed behavior. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (the confirmed post-changepoint regime: 24,29,37,41 \u2192 avg 32.75) to forecast (1+L)-period demand and avoid overreacting to the single high week of 58. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=4 to capture volatility in the new regime. These parameters prioritize meeting the higher sustained demand while limiting excess holding cost given zero current inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $960.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods (orders placed P1\u2013P3 arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 1\u20133 concluded: 37,58,51; avg=48.67) is materially above the earlier post-shift avg (32.75). No missing shipments. To react to the sustained recent uptick, set L by calculating observed lead times, and set demand parameters using the most recent 3-period regime so the OR backend targets stock for the higher recent demand while reflecting recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: recent 3-period avg (Periods 1\u20133 concluded: 37,58,51) = 48.67 vs prior post-shift avg 32.75 (+48.7%), sustained over 3 periods.

Daily Profit: $1083.00, Daily Holding Cost: $10.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1073.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded demand shows a sustained higher regime: last three concluded demands = 58, 51, 57 (Periods 2-4), well above the earlier post-shift mean of ~32.75. All observed lead times = 0 (orders in Periods 1-4 arrived same period). On-hand=10, in-transit=0; expected demand next period likely near recent average. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to let backend confirm 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current elevated regime (N chosen per detected changepoint: recent regime length=3 \u2192 N=3). This biases the base-stock toward the higher recent demand while keeping volatility based on the same 3 most-recent samples, helping the OR engine balance service level against low holding cost ($1/unit) and high profit ($19/unit).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u20135 arrivals reported lead_time 0), so set L by calculating average observed lead time. Recent demand has shifted higher; use the most recent 5 concluded demand observations (Periods 1\u20135: 37,58,51,57,44) to capture the current regime for mean and volatility. This balances service (captures elevated demand) against holding cost by sizing forecast from the latest regime instead of the long historical low-demand weeks.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods (orders placed arrived same period). Demand has clearly shifted up and stabilized since 2019-01-14; recent concluded demands (Periods 2-6) = [58,51,57,44,58] with mean ~53.6. I use L=default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher demand regime (gives (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248 53.6 units). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices bias orders toward meeting the elevated, sustained demand while keeping holding exposure tied to recent variability.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for all observed orders (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand has been elevated since the shift beginning 2019-01-14 and sustained through recent periods (recent demands: P4\u2013P7 = 57,44,58,56). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the post-shift higher demand regime while smoothing short-term noise (uses last 5 samples). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check.

Recent demand has been elevated and sustained (recent concluded demands: 57,44,58,56,60); use recent_N for demand and volatility to capture current high regime. Set mu_hat recent_N N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 periods and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. This raises target base-stock to prioritize service (profit $19 vs holding $1) while keeping volatility estimate grounded in latest regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals show every observed order arrived same-period (arrived=... lead_time was 0) across Periods 1\u201310 -> actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand shows a regime with higher mean than initial sample but last 2 weeks dipped; to be responsive I use a recent_N forecast. L: use calculated average of observed lead times (0). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=5 (captures last 5 demand observations [58,56,60,39,23] to reflect current regime while smoothing short spikes). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These settings keep the base-stock tied to recent demand and confirmed lead time, limiting overstock given holding cost while protecting service on observed higher-demand weeks.

On-hand=40, in-transit=0 so current coverage ~0.95 periods; promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded lead_times=0). To balance high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) I use a short recent-window demand estimate to capture the current elevated regime while avoiding overstock. Set L to calculated (observed lead times average = 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent regime and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead period, enabling the OR engine to size base-stock to service ~1 period of demand with appropriate safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Demand has moderated recently (Periods 10\u201312 concluded demands = 23,34,26). I set L=default to trust the promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the current lower-demand regime (latest three concluded weeks) so the OR backend centers orders on the recent mean and variability rather than the earlier high-spike regime. This keeps target base stock lower to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given current demand evidence.

Recent demand has moderated from earlier peaks; last 5 concluded demands = [39,23,34,26,32], average ~30.8. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstating required stock given low pipeline. This balances service (captures recent demand mean/volatility) against holding cost with current low on-hand inventory.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, last concluded demand spike (Period 14 demand=73) but not yet sustained across multiple periods. All observed concluded lead times = 0. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to confirm actual L=0 (use 'calculate'). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime including the large recent spike while limiting influence of older pre-shift data; this adapts the base-stock to current higher demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 enough to improve service (reduce lost sales) while the low holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit) tolerates higher inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Observed lead times historically = 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time 0). Demand has moved to a higher regime recently (noted spikes: 73,67 in Periods 14\u201315). To cover the elevated recent demand while avoiding excess holding, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (Periods 11\u201315 demands = 34,26,32,73,67; recent mean ~46.4), so the OR backend builds a base stock appropriate for the higher short-term demand and updated volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile: last 4 concluded demands = 32,73,67,52 (avg ~56). On-hand=31, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so keep L as default. To capture the recent higher demand regime while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 periods (N=4) so the backend bases base-stock and cap on the latest demand level and volatility.

Observed lead times historically 0 (all concluded arrivals indicate 0). To protect service during the recent high-demand regime while keeping holding cost moderate, use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 4 weeks to capture current mean and volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent history shows all concluded arrivals had lead_time=0 (no delays). Demand has shifted up since Period 14 (sustained high weekly demand). I set L to calculate to confirm observed lead_time=0 from history. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 14\u201318). Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current volatility. These choices produce a base_stock tailored to the higher recent mean while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with observed arrivals, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14 (2019-05-13): Periods 14\u201318 avg=75.2 (73,67,52,92,92) vs prior Periods 9\u201313 avg=30.8 (39,23,34,26,32) => +144%, sustained over 5 periods

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover immediate demand. Observed concluded lead times all 0, so use default promised L. For demand I use a recent_N window to capture the post-Period-14 high regime (Periods 14\u201319) \u2014 this yields a higher mean (~81 units/week) to avoid stockouts. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base stock to improve service during the new high-demand regime while holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since mid-May with volatile weekly demand (recent demands: 52,92,92,111,46). On-hand=71, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I use promised lead time (default=0) since all concluded lead times are 0. To capture the recent elevated mean and variability while remaining responsive to recent volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples). This biases the base-stock to cover the current higher demand regime without overreacting to a single week spike, balancing service level (profit $19) against $1 holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 14 (higher demand through Period 21); use a recent-window that covers this regime. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 (regime length Periods 14\u201321 = 8) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the recent high-demand regime, balancing higher service needs against holding cost given current on-hand stock and zero in-transit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0, so use promised/default lead time. Demand has shown a sustained higher regime since Period 14 (already recorded in carry-over). Recent demand (Periods 18\u201322 = 92,111,46,72,67) remains elevated vs early history and variable, so I use recent_N=5 to capture the current mean for mu_hat and volatility for sigma_hat. This biases ordering toward serving higher recent demand while keeping holding costs in check.

Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime beginning Period 14 (2019-05-13) and sustained through Period 23; last 10 concluded demands (P14\u2013P23) show elevated average and volatility versus pre-shift. On-hand=5, in-transit=0 \u2192 no incoming arrivals expected (all prior orders concluded on-time, no overdue shipments). Set L by observed lead times (all concluded arrivals show 0) using 'calculate' to reflect confirmed same-period fulfillment. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=10 (regime from P14\u2013P23 length=10) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples; sigma_hat use recent_N N=10 to capture current volatility. This raises target base-stock to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma_hat captures variability to limit excess holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods. A sustained demand regime shift occurred starting Period 14 (2019-05-13) and persists through recent periods; recent elevated demand average motivates using recent-sample forecasts. Therefore: set L to default (promised=0) because concluded lead-time observations confirm 0. Use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-shift regime (Periods 14\u201324, 11 samples) so the OR engine sizes base stock to current higher-demand regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand data. This balances service (higher mu_hat) vs holding cost by focusing estimates on the sustained higher-demand period and leveraging observed zero lead time to avoid excess pipeline buffers.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (all past orders arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 21\u201325: 72,67,114,55,73) supports a higher post-shift mean; I use a recent_N=5 forecast to capture current regime while avoiding overreacting to the single 114 spike. L set to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. mu_hat recent_N=5 to reflect (1+L)*mean of last 5 periods; sigma_hat recent_N=5 to capture recent volatility for safety stock and service-level calculation given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (Periods 22\u201326 demands = 67,114,55,73,116; 5-period avg=85). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover expected (L+1) periods. All concluded lead-time observations show lead_time=0 historically, so use default promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand weeks. This raises the base-stock to meet service (profit>$ holding) while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility to size safety stock and avoid excessive holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 no evidence of delays. Demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning Period 14 (2019-05-13) with elevated weekly demand since then; to capture current elevated demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 (Periods 14\u201327) to reflect the recent higher mean and volatility, which raises the base-stock and the caps to favor service during this sustained high-demand period while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; all concluded lead-times observed = 0. Recent weeks show a sustained demand surge (Periods 21\u201328 and especially 25\u201328: 73,116,173,194) so I bias forecasts to recent data. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=8 to capture the recent high-demand regime while smoothing a bit across two months. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=8 to reflect recent volatility from the surge. These parameters raise the base-stock to protect service during the sustained high-demand regime while sigma_hat captures elevated variability to avoid stockouts without excessive holding given low holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has jumped: last 4 concluded demands = 116, 173, 194, 150 (Periods 26\u201329) indicating a sustained high-demand regime vs earlier weeks. All observed lead times = 0 (orders in history concluded same period), so use default promised lead time. To capture the recent elevated mean/volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (regime_length=4 recent high-demand periods). This biases the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift to record.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand remains on the elevated regime first noted in prior insights (sustained high weekly demand since mid-May). On-hand=19, in-transit=0 so availability is low vs recent weekly demand (~165 units/week). Promised lead time has consistently been 0 (observed arrivals all same-period), so use default lead time to let OR backend assume promised behavior. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201330 demand = 116,173,194,150,195; recent mean \u2248165.6) so mu_hat reflects current intensity. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=5 to reflect current volatility in the same window. These choices push the backend base-stock toward serving the elevated demand while limiting reliance on older low-demand data.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has shifted sharply upward since Period 26. Periods 26\u201331 demands = [116,173,194,150,195,156], recent 6-week avg = 164 units/week vs prior Periods 14\u201325 avg = 80.17 (+~105%). On-hand=65, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the new higher regime. Observed lead times have been consistently 0 in concluded history, so keep L=default. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (regime length=6) so the OR backend builds base-stock around the new mean and volatility, balancing higher service level needs against low holding cost ($1/unit). This addresses missing shipments (none currently) and ensures orders respond to the sustained high-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: Periods 26\u201331 avg=164 vs prior Periods 14\u201325 avg=80.17 (+~105%), sustained over 6 periods

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=66, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime (Periods 27\u201332: 173,194,150,195,156,148) \u2014 sustained high demand without drop. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0) given consistent concluded evidence. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current high-demand regime (avg \u2248169 units/week over last 6 weeks) so the OR base-stock reflects current elevated demand. For sigma I also use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while keeping holding reasonable by using only the recent high-demand window rather than all historical lower-demand periods.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand is in the high regime established from Period 26 onward (large, sustained rise vs earlier periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods of demand; promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded lead_time=0). I set L=default to use the promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 26\u201333) to capture the current high-demand regime (regime length=8) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward stocking at the elevated demand level while keeping safety stock tied to recent variability.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=92, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently observed as 0 \u2014 no evidence of lost/delayed shipments; use promised lead time (default). Demand has remained in the elevated regime established around Period 26 (sustained higher weekly demand); to reflect the recent high-demand level I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=6 (captures the last 6 concluded weeks: Periods 29\u201334). Using recent samples reduces lag vs. long-run mean and keeps base-stock responsive while L=0 keeps review+lead horizon minimal to avoid excess holding given $1 holding cost and $19 profit margin. Sigma set to recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend toward a higher service level appropriate for the sustained elevated demand while capping excessive inventory through the backend cap.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=147, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 26 (sustained elevated weekly demand; recent avg \u2248164 over P26\u2013P35). To reflect the sustained high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand parameters to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime: N=10 (regime length P26\u2013P35=10). This increases base_stock to cover the higher recent mean while sigma using the same recent window captures elevated volatility. Given profit $19 >> holding $1, this raises service level to avoid lost sales while still constraining orders via the OR cap.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows sustained higher demand since mid-year with multiple regime shifts; latest concluded demands (P33\u2013P36) = 219,132,75,69 and ending on-hand=157, in-transit=0. Promised lead time has consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; I keep L as default to match supplier promise. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from all historical samples\u2014this leverages the full demand history (including confirmed mid-year upward shifts) and the backend's high service-level calibration (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95) to set base-stock while avoiding overfitting to the very last noisy weeks. This balances service (capture spikes) against holding cost given current on-hand=157 and zero pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand has fallen from the late-August/Sept peaks; the last 4 concluded demands = [132,75,69,71] (Periods 34\u201337) average \u224886.75, so I use a short recent window to capture the current lower-demand regime. To keep variability aligned with that window I use recent_N for sigma as well. Settings: L=default (promised 0) to reflect observed 0 lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=4 to target the most recent demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (high profit \u2192 high target quantile) while avoiding excess holding by anchoring to recent lower demand and the current zero pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime established earlier (sustained higher volumes since Period 26). On-hand=55, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments visible (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically). I keep L at default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history shows consistent 0-period actual lead time. To capture the recent elevated but variable demand I use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, which focuses the forecast on the last 6 concluded-demand observations (Periods 33\u201338: 219,132,75,69,71,82) and will let the backend set base stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost under current variability.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=153, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 (consistent across periods), so use observed average lead time. Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 26; recent demand (Periods 35\u201339 = 75,69,71,82,53) averages ~70 units/week. To keep service high given profit/holding (q\u22480.95) while avoiding further inventory buildup, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 weeks to reflect current demand conditions and reduce influence of earlier large spikes. These parameters signal the OR backend to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility; L calculated from observed lead times (0), mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent_N=5 to balance service level and holding cost given high on-hand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has moderated from peak but remains ~60\u201380/wk (last 6 concluded demands: P35\u2013P40 = 75,69,71,82,53,54) with mean ~67. On-hand=99, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments and historical actual lead time has been 0. Given high profit vs low holding cost (profit=$19, holding=$1 \u2192 service quantile \u224895%), I use the promised/default lead time (0) and set demand estimates from the most recent regime to capture current reduced-but-still-elevated demand. Using recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR base-stock on current demand level and recent volatility, reducing overstock risk from older high-peak periods while maintaining a high service level implied by profit/holding. This balances fill-rate (profit) against holding cost given ample on-hand inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0. Demand has fallen since Period 33: last 9 concluded demands (P33\u2013P41) avg=89 vs prior high-regime avg\u2248164 (P26\u2013P32) \u2014 sustained drop over 9 periods. To adapt quickly to the new lower regime while using recent evidence, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (the detected recent regime length) so the OR backend computes forecast and volatility based on the most recent 9 observations, which helps reduce overstock from the prior high-demand regime while preserving service given current demand uncertainty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: Periods 33\u201341 avg=89 vs prior Periods 26\u201332 avg=164 (\u221245.7%), sustained over 9 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $1320.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=105, in-transit=0. Recent demand since the last confirmed regime change at Period 33 has been lower and more variable (Periods 33\u201342 demands: 219,132,75,69,71,82,53,54,46,75). No new sustained changepoint detected. All historical concluded lead times = 0. I choose L='default' to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to focus the forecast on the most recent 10 weeks (the current post-Period33 regime length = 10), so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest lower/variable demand. This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent downward shift while avoiding overstock given holding cost; having on-hand=105 and no in-transit means orders will top up based on recent demand, reducing holding cost risk while preserving service.

Set L=default (use promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (mean of last 6 samples ~46.17 demand per period). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to the current lower-demand regime while the zero lead time lets the OR engine order same-period if needed, reducing holding cost risk given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=72, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use default promised L. Recent weeks (Periods 43\u201346) show a sustained low-demand regime (demands: 20,29,26,27; 4-week avg=25.5) vs prior higher regimes; to avoid excess holding costs while preserving high service level (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95), I set demand estimates using the recent 4-week regime. Therefore: L=default so backend uses promised lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the latest lower-demand regime and reduce order quantities given ample on-hand inventory.
