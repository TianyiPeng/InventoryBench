Mean ~120 units/week but high variance and a recent high (216 on 2019-02-04). c) Lead time: Supplier promised 0; no concluded arrivals history to confirm actual lead time. With on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, treat lead time as uncertain (could be 0 or >=1). d) Inventory/pipeline: No stock on-hand or in-transit. Because arrivals occur after decision, and actual lead time is unconfirmed, we should order enough to cover the upcoming high-probability demand for one immediate selling period while avoiding excessive holding cost ($1/unit/period versus $4 profit). e) Order logic: target roughly one period's expected demand elevated for possible Valentine demand. Using recent mean (~120) and allowing a modest Valentine's uplift, I order 150 units to balance service (capture increased demand) and holding cost.",
