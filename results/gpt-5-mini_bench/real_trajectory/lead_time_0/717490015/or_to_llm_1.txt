OR recommended 45 units based on historical samples and promised LT; that recommendation does not account for the confirmed LT=0 or the recent tapering from the peak.

Rationale: with LT=0 the placed order would arrive immediately, but on-hand 58 already covers the expected current-period demand (~91) only partially\u2014however placing a large order risks high holding cost ($1/unit/period) while demand shows signs of tapering. Given the high holding cost relative to profit ($4 profit, $1 holding) and the recent downward trend from the peak (129\u219280\u219282\u219272), holding extra inventory is costly. We therefore refrain from ordering this period and monitor demand next period; if demand continues \u2265 ~90\u2013130, place an order next period to replenish.

Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so all future sales must be met by the order placed now (L+1=1 period coverage). Recent realized weekly demands (P41\u2013P45) = [12,21,18,12,29], mean \u224818.4 units; last several months show a lower post-peak regime vs summer spikes. Calendar/context: Period 46 date 2019-12-23 is the week of Christmas when T-shirt sales can temporarily increase; a moderate short-term uplift is plausible but not a sustained regime shift. OR recommendation (88) is based on long-run historical variance and promised lead time; it is excessive given confirmed lead time=0 and recent low weekly demand. Trade-off: profit per unit $4 vs holding $1 favors stocking additional safety stock for a likely one-period holiday uplift, but excess inventory will incur holding cost and likely not be sold after the holiday. Final strategy: Order enough to cover expected week demand plus a conservative holiday uplift (\u22482\xd7 recent mean). 2\xd718.4 \u224836.8; round to 40 units to avoid simple stockouts while limiting holding cost exposure. This undercuts OR's 88 recommendation because OR overestimates required pipeline given actual lead time and recent demand decline. Action will arrive same period and will be available for Period 46 demand.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (all past orders arrived same period). Inventory check: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage for Period 47 demand. Demand analysis: recent weeks show much lower demand than summer spike \u2014 last 4 concluded demands = 18,12,29,40 (avg \u224825). OR baseline (88) is inflated by earlier high summer weeks (Jul) and uses long-run history; that would create excessive holding cost now. Profit vs holding implies a relatively high service target, but with lead time=0 we only need to cover one upcoming period. Decision: order 30 units (\u2248 recent avg 25 plus small safety of ~20%) to meet expected near-term demand while avoiding large holding costs. This reduces risk of heavy overstock from OR's summer-inflated recommendation while keeping reasonable service for next period.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Reduced OR's 88\u219230: actual lead time=0 and recent demand avg \u224825/week (last 4 weeks), so order one-week coverage plus small safety to avoid excess holding cost.",
