Reality check: realized demand in Periods 1 and 2 was 126 each (much higher than historical mean), so recent demand regime appears elevated. Because actual lead time = 0, an order placed now will arrive during this period and can immediately satisfy demand. Risk tradeoff: profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding cost ($1), so cost of understocking is high. OR's recommendation is 132 units; that slightly overshoots the recent single-period demand (126). I choose to order 126 units to directly cover one-period expected demand (matching the two most recent observed demands) while avoiding modest extra holding.
