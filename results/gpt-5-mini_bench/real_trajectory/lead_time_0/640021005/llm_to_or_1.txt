Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (5 weeks) show mean demand = (6+4+20+14+18)/5 = 12.4 units/week. Promised lead time=0 and no concluded arrivals to contradict it. Profit and holding cost equal ($1), so service-level tradeoff neutral. Use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and volatility from full sample for a balanced base-stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand (Period1 sold=24) is markedly above older samples (historical weekly: 6,4,20,14,18). I detect a possible upward regime but have only one very recent conclude, so I use a short recent window to be responsive while avoiding overfitting. Set L=default (promised 0) since observed lead_time=0 for the Period1 order. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast on the last three concluded demands (24,18,14) which captures the recent higher level without relying solely on a single spike. This increases target base-stock to improve service given zero on-hand/in-transit and balances holding cost by limiting N to 3.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent realized demands (Periods 1-2) are much higher (24,29) than Jan sample mean (~12.4) but only two high periods \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. Concluded arrivals show observed lead_times = 0 for orders placed in P1 and P2, so I set L via calculate to use observed lead times. To adapt to possible upward demand without overcommitting to a permanent shift, I use an EWMA forecast (gamma=0.5) for mu_hat to weight recent high demand more while retaining historical information. Sigma_hat uses default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overreacting to limited recent variance evidence. This balances higher service-level from recent demand while controlling holding cost risk given limited evidence of a sustained shift.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 all arrived same period (lead_time=0). Demand has been volatile with recent large draws (sold 13,19,25 vs demand 24,29,95); to prioritize service while controlling holding cost, set lead time based on observed data and use a short recent-window demand estimate to capture the recent regime. Chosen L='calculate' to confirm actual lead time=0 from concluded arrivals. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=3) to weight the most recent demand behavior (captures recent higher demand variability) so the OR backend computes base stock responsive to the recent surge while the capped order limits avoid extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period1, Period2\u2192Period2, Period3\u2192Period3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has accelerated sharply (Period2\u20134 demands: 29, 95, 174) vs. earlier low-Jan samples; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so replenish. Lead time confirmed 0 in prior periods, so use promised lead time. To capture the recent regime shift I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to weight the last three high demands and sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the surge while L=default preserves the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demand shows a clear, sustained upward regime from Periods 3\u20135 (demands: 95, 174, 254) versus earlier low weeks. Lead time was confirmed as 0 in carry-over. To respond to the higher demand regime while keeping parameters robust to recent volatility, set L=default (use promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the last three-period mean and variability (captures current spike and short-term volatility). This raises target base stock to cover the new demand level while sigma_hat reflects recent spread so the OR backend balances service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: periods 3\u20135 avg = 174.33 vs earlier periods1\u20132 avg = 26.50 (+~560%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime: Periods 3\u20136 demands = 95, 174, 254, 173 (avg=174 over last 4). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been confirmed 0 in prior conclues. I set L to default (promised 0). To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (last 4 periods: P3\u2013P6) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of recent high-demand samples and volatility from those same samples. This raises target base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand while keeping safety stock proportional to observed recent variability, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift to higher weekly demand from Period 3 onward (recent demands: 95,174,254,173,243). To match the current high-demand regime and confirmed same-day arrivals, set L using observed lead times and set demand estimates using the most recent regime. Chosen methods: L=calculate to capture confirmed 0-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) and sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the last 5 high-demand samples, balancing service level vs holding cost under the new regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent periods (P3\u2013P8) show a sustained higher-demand regime versus P1\u2013P2 (periods: 95,174,254,173,243,578). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded messages. To capture the new demand regime, set L to calculated (observed lead times), and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the last 6 demand samples (Periods 3\u20138). This raises base_stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period under current high demand while sigma_hat from the same window controls safety stock against variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has shifted to a high regime since Period 3 (periods 3\u20139 demands: 95,174,254,173,243,578,216). On-hand=37, in-transit=0 \u2014 insufficient vs. recent weekly mean (~247). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use observed lead-time estimator. To protect service level while avoiding excessive holding cost, forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime (last 7 periods) for mu_hat and match sigma_hat to the same window for volatility. Using recent_N=7 captures the full sustained high-demand regime (Periods 3\u20139).

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. Recent demand (Periods 6\u201310 = 173,243,578,216,183) is much higher than early-period levels; I use a recent-window forecast to capture the elevated regime. Set L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (Periods 6\u201310) so the OR engine targets inventory appropriate for the new high-demand regime while avoiding excess long-term holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand 141, in-transit 0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 3\u20135 (noted earlier). Recent demand since Period 6 remains elevated but variable (periods 6\u201311 demand: 173,243,578,216,183,138). To capture the new high-demand regime while weighting recent variability, I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 6\u201311) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. L uses promised/confirmed 0 (default). This ensures the OR backend forecasts across the review+lead period using the most relevant recent regime, improving service while avoiding excessive overstock from older low-demand samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand history shows a high-variance regime since Period 3 with peak weeks (e.g. P8=578) but last 5 demands (P8\u2013P12 = 578,216,183,138,162) give a more current view. On-hand = 94, in-transit = 0, so no arrivals expected this period. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods; I'll use observed lead-time averaging to confirm L=0. To balance service vs. holding cost (profit=holding cost), I bias the forecast to recent data: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples to capture the current regime and variance so the OR engine orders to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand while capping extreme over-ordering from older data.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 3 (documented earlier). On-hand =129, in-transit=0; pipeline is empty so we must keep inventory to cover (1+L) demand. I set L to default (promised 0, confirmed by arrivals). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 3\u201313) rather than the small pre-shift Jan samples; this biases base_stock toward the new regime and lets the OR backend compute safety stock. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given current ample on-hand stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=96, in-transit=0. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals in same period). Recent demand has moderated from earlier peaks; last 5 period demands = [183,138,162,127,117], mean \u2248145.4. To target current recent demand regime and keep holding cost balanced against $1 profit, I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility reflecting the most recent stable regime and avoids overweighting earlier extreme peaks.

Demand has shown a sustained higher regime earlier (recorded), but recent weeks are variable. Use promised/default lead time to match confirmed behavior and use default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all historical samples for mu and sigma, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

To reflect the recent elevated demand and avoid dilution from the two very small early samples, I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times (returns 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=14 periods: P3\u2013P16) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility using current high-demand behavior, improving service with minimal excess holding given profit=holding.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent history shows sustained higher demand since Period 3 with variability; on-hand=81, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and prior conclude messages confirm LT=0, so use default lead time to keep arrivals same-period. To capture the current demand regime and recent variability, I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the most recent 5 weeks of demand to set (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This biases the base-stock toward recent demand while limiting exposure to older high-variance samples; with profit=holding, target service quantile=0.5 so mean-driven ordering balances stockouts vs holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0; use promised lead time. Recent demand shows a higher sustained regime vs early periods; I use the last 5 weeks to capture current demand (periods 14\u201318 demands = 117,281,131,125,96 \u2192 mean\u2248150) so mu_hat and sigma_hat are based on recent_N N=5. This keeps orders responsive to the elevated demand while limiting holding cost given current on-hand stock.

For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent demand regime (Periods 15\u201319: 281,131,125,96,142) so mu_hat reflects current higher mean and sigma_hat reflects recent volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost.

Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 3\u201320 = 18 samples) so the backend sizes base-stock and safety stock to the elevated mean and volatility while avoiding overreliance on early low-demand samples.

Lead times have been consistently observed as 0; use observed-average to confirm. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast on the latest regime and avoid overweighting the Mar spike. This gives (1+L)-scaled mean and recent volatility for the OR engine so orders respond to current demand while limiting excess holding cost.

Demand has been in a higher regime since Periods 3\u20135 and remained elevated thereafter; recent 20 periods capture current post-changepoint demand pattern and volatility. I keep L as default (promised lead time 0, supported by consistent evidence). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=20 to forecast (1+L)-period demand and estimate volatility from the most recent 20 demand observations so the OR engine targets service for the current higher-demand regime while avoiding excess stock given equal profit/holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in multiple periods), and demand has been at a higher regime since Periods 3\u20135 onward (sustained high weekly sales). To keep behavior consistent with confirmed lead time and use all available demand history for stability, I select default lead time and default demand parameterization so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use full history given volatile weeks) against holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (confirmed earlier). Demand shifted up starting Period 3 and has remained at the higher regime for many periods; to reflect this sustained higher mean/volatility I use recent_N=20 to focus the forecast on the most recent data (captures recent seasonal/trend behavior). Because profit and holding cost are equal (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), the policy centers on the mean demand across the review+lead period; using recent_N stabilizes orders against older, low-demand samples and addresses overdue/no in-transit stock by aligning base-stock to recent demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for all observed orders (Period1\u21921 through Period25\u219225), so use promised/default lead time. Demand experienced a past sustained regime shift (Periods 3\u20135) but recent demands (Periods 6\u201325) show no new sustained changepoint; therefore use default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (symmetrical tradeoff).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed 0 across multiple periods) and a sustained demand regime increase beginning Period 3 (Periods 3\u20135 avg >> Periods1\u20132). To respect the confirmed promised lead time and capture the recent high-demand regime, I set L to default (promised=0) and use recent_N forecasts based on the most recent 20 demand samples to reflect the current elevated mean and volatility while smoothing older low-demand data. Using recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat helps the OR backend target service with a base-stock tuned to the current regime and avoids overreacting to older low-demand weeks. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods (periods 1\u201327 concludes show arrivals same period). Demand regime shift occurred at Period 6 (sustained higher demand since P3\u2013P27). I therefore keep L as default (promised=0). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand parameters using the most recent regime length capped at 20 samples (recent behavior dominant since P3). This biases the OR base-stock toward current elevated demand while the sigma uses the same recent window to capture contemporary volatility. These choices aim to raise service level to avoid lost sales given zero pipeline, while not overstating uncertainty.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand has been in the higher regime confirmed at Period 6 (periods 3\u201328 show sustained high demand vs initial low periods). On-hand=22, in-transit=0 so we start with low cover; promised and observed lead time = 0 (confirmed multiple periods). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to default (use promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime; choose N=20 to capture the most recent 20 samples (balances recency and sample size). This raises target base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma from recent data captures current variability, helping the OR engine trade service level vs holding cost appropriately.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201329 arrivals matched same-period orders). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime vs early periods; last 6 concluded demands (Periods 24\u201329) = [104,161,195,190,155,126], mean\u2248155.2. I set L=default to use promised lead time 0 (confirmed by concluded history). I select mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to capture the recent high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples) so the base stock responds to the current demand level. I select sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility for safety stock. These choices keep orders aligned with observed same-period arrivals and recent demand, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201330), so use promised lead time. Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 3 (sustained high weekly sales); to focus the forecast on the recent operating regime I use a recent-N demand estimate based on the last 10 concluded periods to capture current mean across the (1+L) review+lead window. I keep sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overfitting variance from a short window. These choices prioritize meeting the high current demand while limiting overreaction to single-week spikes; with profit=holding, the backend will target service via the base-stock computed from this recent mean and default volatility.

Current on-hand=26, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I choose L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 0-period lead time.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0, so use calculated lead time (avg observed). Recent demand (Periods 28\u201332 = 155,126,159,131,137) averages ~141.6 \u2014 demand remains in the ~130\u2013160 range. To keep service while avoiding extra holding cost, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (captures current regime) and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. Using calculate for L ensures backend uses observed lead time (0) rather than promised by default, aligning orders to same-period arrivals and avoiding overstock from incorrect longer lead-time assumptions.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we start with no cover for upcoming demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised lead time. Demand has been elevated and relatively stable since Period 3 (sustained high regime); to reflect the recent high-volume regime and avoid understocking I use recent_N=20 (most recent 20 weeks) for both demand mean and volatility so the OR engine sizes base-stock to recent demand patterns. This balances higher service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost by letting the backend compute z* from profit vs holding cost while supplying up-to-date \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 inputs. No overdue shipments or lost arrivals detected.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show stable actual lead time=0 across many periods and a sustained demand regime shift to much higher weekly demand since Periods 3\u20135 onward. I choose L=default (use promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and emphasize recent patterns, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the latest ~20 weeks of demand to adapt to the higher mean and updated volatility). This biases base-stock toward meeting elevated demand while letting the backend cap limit extreme orders, balancing service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding values.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has declined from the mid-summer high; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [137,177,97,72,53] (mean ~107). To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base mu_hat on the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the downshift. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture current variability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 periods consistently. Recent weeks show lower demand but not a clear, sustained regime shift requiring model change. Use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this leverages all data and keeps policy stable given confirmed L=0 and equal profit/holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=82, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand historically elevated from Periods 3\u20135 and then sustained at higher levels; no new sustained changepoint detected since last carry-over. Use promised/default lead time to match observed 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history, keeping forecasts stable given ample history and avoiding overreacting to short-term noise. This balances service level (meet continued moderate demand) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=89, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show substantially lower demand vs spring spike (Periods ~34\u201339 demands mostly 47,56,79,53,72,97,131,159 earlier then falling). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes so use promised/default L=0. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N with N=8 for both demand mean and volatility (captures the most recent two months of weekly demand without over-weighting the large spring spike). This keeps base_stock aligned to current demand and limits holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1 \u2192 q=0.5).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has declined vs the spring/summer peak: last 6 concluded demands (Periods 35\u201340) = [72,53,79,56,47,24], mean \u2248 55. On-hand=66, in-transit=0 so current coverage ~1.2 periods. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default to use promised (and historically confirmed) 0. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility based on the most recent 6 weeks, balancing service vs holding cost given current ample on-hand stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (Periods 1\u201341). Recent demand is much lower than the spring/summer peaks; last 7 concluded weekly demands (Periods 35\u201341) average \u224851.7 units/week versus much higher earlier values. To reflect the recent lower regime I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most recent 7 samples, reducing target base-stock and volatility to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given current demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (sustained across periods); demand has fallen from spring/summer peaks to lower recent weekly values (Period40\u201342 demands = 24, 31, 78). Because profit = holding cost, I choose a conservative short-run forecast based on the most recent data to avoid excess inventory while preserving service. Set L to promised (default 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the latest demand regime and reduce carry risk.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 consistently (Periods 1\u201343). Recent demand has moderated compared with the spring spike; last 8 concluded demands (Periods 36\u201343) = [53,79,56,47,24,31,78,25], average \u224849.1. I choose L=default (promised 0) because lead time has been confirmed as 0. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstocking from earlier high-demand months. These parameters aim to align base stock to current demand while limiting holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent weeks show muted demand (periods 40\u201344 demand = 24,31,78,25,17 with recent 3-week avg \u2248 40 but last two weeks 25 and 17). On-hand=33, in-transit=0 so available inventory covers ~0.5\u20131 weeks of recent demand; no shipments currently overdue. Prior carry-over confirmed lead time = 0 and a prior sustained demand regime shift (Periods 3\u20135). No new sustained changepoint detected. Given confirmed same-day arrivals historically and no evidence of new lead-time delays, set L to default (promised 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7historical std using full sample history\u2014this leverages long-run data while the backend will cap orders to avoid extreme replenishment. This balances service (we have moderate on-hand) against equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5 \u2192 neutral service level).

Recent weeks show moderate/low demand vs earlier spring spike, but the spike appears episodic and earlier lead time confirmation is strong. To let the OR engine use full sample history and the confirmed lead time, I select default lead time and default demand statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock rooted in long-run data while the confirmed L=0 ensures orders arrive same period.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=114, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed historically). Recent demand (Periods 40\u201346) is lower and more variable than the earlier high-demand regime; to avoid excess holding cost I use a recent-window demand estimate to size reorder. Choose L=default (promised 0), mu_hat=recent_N using recent data to reflect current low-demand regime, sigma_hat=default to let backend use overall volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This reduces order quantities versus using the long-run high-demand mean and balances service level vs holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.
