{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows arrivals same-period repeatedly \u2192 actual lead time = 0. Inventory state: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage for current-period demand. Demand outlook: recent periods (P44\u2013P46) show elevated demand (45,65,71) and several prior weeks with 30\u201370 range; OR's capped base-stock (72) already incorporates historical mean/variance and the profit/holding critical fractile (q=4/(4+1)=0.8 \u2192 z\u22480.84). With lead time = 0, orders arrive in the same period (so will be available for period demand after arrival resolution), and holding cost is modest relative to profit.
