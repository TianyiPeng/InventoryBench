Historical demand (weekly samples through 2019-02-04) averages ~509 units/week (samples: 752, 477, 500, 430, 384). No concluded arrivals exist in history to infer actual lead time; supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead_time is unknown and must be inferred only from conclude messages. Current inventory/on\u2010hand = 0, in\u2010transit = 0 so all demand must be satisfied from new arrivals. Given holding cost = profit per unit, overstock penalizes equally to selling \u2014 so target is to meet expected near-term demand without large safety stock. Forecast for Period 1 demand \u2248 500 units. Because lead time is uncertain but promised 0, placing an order sized to cover expected demand this period balances service vs holding cost.",
