{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded periods show every order from P1\u2013P45 arrived same period (e.g., 'ordered P1 arrived P1'), so actual lead time = 0 periods; orders placed now will arrive during Period 46 before demand. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no coverage for current-period demand. Demand analysis: recent realized demands are elevated \u2014 P42=627 (spike), P43=143, P44=283, P45=247; 4-period recent average = 325 units. OR baseline: OR recommends 241 units (uses historical mean and promised lead time). Adjustment rationale: with lead time = 0 we can and should supply current-period demand immediately; given recent 4-week average ~325 and the holiday-season demand spike risk, I increase OR\u2019s recommendation to cover expected demand rather than risk a stockout. Holding cost equals profit (q=0.5) so the policy is neutral between stockout and overstock; current high recent demand favors provisioning more.
