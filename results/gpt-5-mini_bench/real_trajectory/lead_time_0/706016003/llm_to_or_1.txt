Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU has on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals so no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks: 752,477,500,430,384) show no recent regime change. Promised lead time (0) will be used. Use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=263, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows ordered=509 arrived=509 (lead_time=0), so actual lead time confirmed at 0 based on observed arrival. Demand history mean\u2248508.6 (5 samples). I select L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This forces the OR engine to target a base stock near historical weekly demand while respecting the confirmed zero lead time and the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=169, in-transit=0. Recent observed demands (2019-02-04=384, Period1 2019-02-11=246, Period2 2019-02-18=296) show a sustained lower-demand regime vs older samples. Promised lead time observed historically = 0 (orders from Periods 1-2 arrived with 0 LT). Use L=default to trust promised LT. Forecast demand using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new regime: mu_hat based on last 3 samples (reduces target base-stock to reflect lower demand). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. Given profit=holding, z*=0 so base_stock equals mu_hat; this choice balances service vs holding by anchoring to recent lower demand while keeping variability estimate conservative.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-02-04: recent mean of [384,246,296]=308.7 vs prior mean of [752,477,500,430,384]=508.6 (\u2248-39%)

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand has shifted down vs earlier history (recent low regime visible over last 3 periods). On-hand=87, in-transit=0 \u2014 coverage is well below recent single-period demand. I set L to calculate to reflect observed lead times (all concluded lead_time=0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new lower regime (most recent demands: 246, 296, 222). Sigma uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the backend on the current lower-demand regime while keeping safety stock small given equal profit and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $169.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. Demand has dropped recently \u2014 use the most recent 3 periods to capture the new lower regime (reduces forecast and safety stock). Therefore set L=default, mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given low current pipeline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has declined and stabilized below earlier levels (recent week sales: 246,296,222,212,180). Lead times observed in concluded history are consistently 0. To reflect the lower recent demand I set mu_hat using a recent_N window of the last 5 demand observations (captures the post-change regime). I also set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. L remains default (promised lead time = 0). This keeps base-stock aligned to the new lower-demand regime while using recent volatility for safety.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand has declined vs early-sample highs: last 3 demands = [212,180,178] (mean=190) vs earlier periods higher. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders placed previously arrived same period). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. I therefore set L to default actual behavior (0) but choose mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent low-demand regime to avoid overstocking: use recent_N with N=3 to capture the latest mean/volatility. No evidence of lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has settled much lower than earlier in the series (decline evident since Feb). On-hand=62, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected this period. Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently, so keep promised lead time. To reflect the sustained lower demand regime I use a recent-sample forecast: (1+L)*mean of the last 5 demand observations to avoid overstocking. Volatility estimated from the same recent 5 samples to match current variability and keep safety stock tight given profit=holding ($1 vs $1 -> q=0.5, low z*). Methods chosen: L=default (promised 0), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 (captures current low-demand regime), sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 (matches recent variability).

Carry-over insight: Demand sustained in a lower regime: avg of last 5 periods (P3-P7 demands = 222,212,180,178,128) = 184 vs earlier series mean ~508.6 (\u2248-64%); signal is sustained over 5 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 3 (sustained through Period 8); on-hand=53, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 in all periods, so use calculated average lead time. To reflect the persistent lower demand, use recent_N (last 6 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-scaled forecast and volatility reflect the new regime and reduce over-ordering/holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=56, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty and we must size order to cover (1+L) review+lead demand. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 each period; I use calculate to let backend confirm average=0. For demand I select recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices reduce excess holding cost while maintaining service for the new lower-demand regime.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=93, in-transit=0, profit=holding both $1 so q=0.5 (balanced). I set L=default (promised 0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid overweighting the much higher historical pre-shift weeks. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility (including the drop to 55). These choices keep target base-stock tuned to recent lower demand, reducing overstock risk given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (all concluded orders had lead_time 0). On-hand=64, in-transit=0 \u2014 no outstanding arrivals. Demand has moved to a much lower regime recently (recent 5-week demands: 128,131,120,55,59 -> mean ~98.6), so I bias forecasts toward the most recent behavior to avoid excess holdings. Set L to calculated average observed lead time (0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and recent volatility, which reduces target base-stock and caps order size to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 each period (orders placed P1..P12 all arrived same period). Demand has shifted to a sustained lower regime (carry-over notes: regime shift starting P3 and sustained low avg by P8). To be responsive to the recent lower demand and avoid holding cost, set L by calculating observed lead time (confirming 0). Forecast demand using the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 demand observations) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock appropriate for the current low-demand level and tighter volatility estimate, reducing overstock risk given zero pipeline and holding cost equal to profit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 (every concluded order had lead_time 0). On-hand=53, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Demand has sustained a lower regime since early Feb (carry-over notes), so I use recent data to capture current lower mean/volatility. I set L=default to honor observed 0 lead time, mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands, and sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target stock aligned with the current lower-demand regime while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 3 and sustained through Period 14 (recent weeks far below earlier 508.6 avg). On-hand=34, in-transit=0 \u2014 no pending arrivals. All concluded lead-times have been 0 periods. I set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (confirming 0). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, I use recent_N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 12 demand samples, tightening the forecast to recent lower volumes and reducing overstock risk given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P15 arrived same period). Demand has shifted to a sustained lower regime starting around Period 3 and confirmed through Period 8+; recent demand has been consistently lower than early-series mean. On-hand=66, in-transit=0; with low demand regime I choose to trust the lower recent demand for forecast. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=13 (regime length ~P3\u2013P15 = 13 samples) so the backend builds base-stock targeted to the current low-demand regime and reduces excess holding while maintaining service.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period. Demand has been in a sustained lower regime for many periods (recent 5-period avg \u2248184 vs earlier ~509). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default=0) and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime (recent_N, N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory toward the current lower demand.

Demand has been in a sustained lower regime since Period 3 (carry-over notes); most recent 5 demands (P13-P17 = 45,46,59,58,45) average ~50.6. To reflect the persistent lower demand and recent short-run mean, I set L to default (promised=0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets base stock around the recent demand level and captures recent volatility, reducing excess inventory while preserving service given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Demand has shifted to and sustained in a lower regime since early periods (recent weekly sales ~ last 5 concluded demands = 59,58,45,46,59,26, etc. \u2014 recent variability and lower mean). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets the current lower-demand regime and tighter uncertainty estimate.

Demand has been in a sustained lower regime for many periods (recent demand examples P15-P19 = [59,58,45,26,22]; earlier series mean ~508). Given profit=$1 and holding=$1, keep inventory lean and use recent demand to forecast. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (N=5 matches the recent stable window), so the OR engine will target a smaller base-stock and reduce holding costs while preserving service for current low demand.

Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Demand has settled into a lower regime since early Feb with sustained low weekly sales over many periods; using a recent demand window avoids overstating forecast from earlier high-demand months. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 demands) to reflect current low regime and reduce excess holdings. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility. These parameters bias the OR engine toward leaner base-stock, balancing low profit/holding parity (profit=$1, holding=$1) and avoiding high ending inventory given current weak demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent history shows a sustained lower demand regime since early periods (noted previously). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods of expected demand. Historical observed lead times = 0 consistently, so keep L=default (promised=0). To forecast demand I use an EWMA to downweight last period's large spike (P23=102) while reflecting recent low baseline; EWMA_gamma=0.3 gives moderate smoothing toward recent low values. For volatility I use recent_N with N=5 to capture current short-run variability. These choices reduce over-ordering after the one-off spike while keeping service level for typical low demand, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2192 no coverage for upcoming demand. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period (orders placed arrived same period). Demand has been in a lower regime versus initial series but recent weeks show volatility including two large spikes (Periods 23-24 demand 102,171). To be responsive to recent demand while reflecting the sustained lower baseline, I use the promised lead time (default=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from a recent window to capture current level and volatility. I choose recent_N with N=8 to balance noise from the two large recent spikes against several prior low-demand weeks (N=8 covers the most recent two-month sample to adapt quickly but smooth extremes). These parameters will nudge the OR engine to stock for near-term observed demand while keeping safety stock limited given high holding cost (profit=holding so service level q=0.5), avoiding excessive inventory when spikes may be transient.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use default promised lead time. Demand shows a recent sharp uptick: last 5 demands (P21-P25 = 21,34,102,171,246) average ~114.8, far above the earlier low-regime mean. To balance service (avoid stockouts during this spike) vs holding cost, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current elevated mean and set sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect increased volatility for safety.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand spike starting Period 22: avg demand P22-P25 = (34+102+171+246)/4 = 138.25 (4 periods) vs prior low-regime avg ~184 over P3-P7 is higher on these last 4 periods; treat as sustained short-term uptick.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand shows a sustained uptick beginning Period 22 (demands P22-P28 = [34,102,171,246,213,160,344]); to capture this new higher-demand regime I set lead time to promised (default, observed historically as 0) and use recent_N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the last 7 weeks. This raises target base-stock to improve service during the confirmed uptick while the backend's cap limits exposure to holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all past orders arrived same period) and recent demand shows a sustained uptick beginning Period 22 (P22\u2013P29 demands = 34,102,171,246,213,160,344,264; recent mean \u2248191.8). No overdue shipments. I set L=default to reflect the consistently observed 0-period lead time. I choose mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 8 samples). I choose sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These parameters let the OR backend target service for the confirmed higher short-term demand while using observed lead time to avoid unnecessary pipeline inflation.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has risen materially in Periods 26-30 (213,160,344,264,173; mean\u2248230.8) versus the prior low-regime (~184). On-hand=19, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 with all observed lead_times=0. To capture the recent higher demand while limiting holding cost, set L=default to trust promised 0; set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean; set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to satisfy elevated demand while sigma reflects higher variability so OR backend caps orders sensibly.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: avg P26-P30 = 230.8 vs prior low-regime avg P3-P7 = 184 (+25%), sustained over 5 periods

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand regime elevated vs earlier low regime: last 5 demands (P27-P31 = 160,344,264,173,127) average \u2248213.6, higher and more volatile than the long-run low. On-hand=104, in-transit=0 \u2192 limited pipeline. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default lead time to match backend expectations. For demand I use a recent_N (N=5) estimate to capture the current higher regime (reduces stockouts vs using full-series mean). For sigma I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the higher volatility in these last 5 weeks. These settings raise the base-stock to cover the current uptick while sigma increases safety stock to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=126, in-transit=0 \u2014 low pipeline versus recent weekly demand, so replenish to cover (1+L) review+lead demand using a recent-regime mean. I set L=default (promised=0, historically actual lead time=0). I set mu_hat via recent_N N=5 to capture the new higher regime without overreacting to a single spike. I set sigma_hat via recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while keeping holding cost in check.

Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime from Period 26\u201331, but Period 33 exhibits an extreme one-period spike (881) that appears anomalous vs prior weeks; avoid overreacting to that single outlier. Select EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to weight recent uptick while damping the Period 33 outlier. Keep sigma_hat as default to reflect long-run variability. These choices balance service (capture sustained uptick) vs holding cost (prevent over-ordering on a single anomalous spike).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (every concluded order shows lead_time=0). Demand shows a clear uplift since Period 26 with particularly large spikes in Periods 33-34 (demands 881 and 590). However the spike is only 2 periods so not yet a new sustained regime. To balance service vs holding cost I use a recent-window demand forecast to capture the current elevated demand while keeping lead time at the promised/default (0). I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand pattern (last 5 periods) so the OR backend raises base-stock and safety stock appropriately without overreacting to a single extreme period.

Recent periods show a strong demand spike (Periods 31-35); to capture the current high mean and elevated volatility I use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (focuses the forecast on the most recent regime). This raises the base-stock to cover the uptick while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to preserve service despite high variability, balancing profit vs holding cost given equal profit and holding per unit.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has jumped sharply starting Period 32\u201336 (large spikes and stockouts); on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet elevated demand. Observed lead times have consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use default promised lead time. For demand forecast use a recent_N mean over the last 5 observed demand periods (P32\u2013P36) to capture the new high regime (mean=460.8). Use recent_N for sigma over the same 5 periods to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize service (higher base stock) during the confirmed high-demand regime while keeping holding cost visible to the OR backend.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 32: avg demand P32\u2013P36 = 460.8 vs prior avg P26\u2013P30 = 230.8 (+99%), sustained over 5 periods.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained high regime since Period 32 (P33-P37 demands = 881,590,338,405,470); we should size orders to this elevated regime. Lead time history shows concluded lead_time=0 each period, so keep promised lead time. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current high-mean, high-volatility regime and let OR backend set service level tradeoff (profit=holding so q=0.5).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep L as default (promised=0). Recent demand regime is high (Periods 34\u201338 demands = 590,338,407,470,455); I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime and avoid understocking. This raises the base stock to match elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N reflects current volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has moved to a higher regime: last 5 realized demands (Periods 35-39) = [338, 405, 470, 455, 246], recent mean \u2248 382.8 and elevated volatility versus earlier low-regime. On-hand=206, in-transit=0 so available coverage is limited. All concluded lead-time observations are 0 periods. I therefore set L using observed history (calculate=0). To capture the recent uptick and avoid stockouts I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases the base-stock on the most recent regime (balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been elevated vs earlier low regime: last 5 demands (P36\u2013P40) = [407,470,455,246,302], recent mean = 376. On-hand=82, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and historical concluded lead-times are consistently 0. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current higher-demand regime (changepoint evidence: sustained high demand from P32 onward, selecting the most recent 5-week window to represent current demand). Sigma is set recent_N N=5 to reflect volatility in this same recent window. These choices give the OR backend a forecast centered on the recent elevated demand while keeping safety stock consistent with recent variability, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=102, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders shown arriving same period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 32; use a recent_N forecast to capture the current elevated mean and variability (last 5 periods) so the OR engine sets base-stock to meet current demand while avoiding excess inventory given equal profit/holding costs.

Demand has been volatile with recent large weekend/holiday spikes (Period 42 demand=627). To balance service vs holding cost given current high recent demand but limited sustained evidence of a new long-term regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets stocking for the most recent demand level while keeping lead time at promised (default=0).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=238, in-transit=0. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use default promised L=0. Recent weeks (Periods 39-43 demands = 246,302,274,627,143) show elevated and volatile holiday demand; I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current spike/regime and recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent holiday demand surge while letting the OR backend cap orders using its cap formula.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

On-hand=36, in-transit=0 (no arrivals pending). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. I choose L=default (promised 0) because all observed lead times remain 0. To capture the recent elevated regime while limiting noise from older low-demand periods, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the most recent 5 demand samples). This raises the backend base stock to reflect current demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility; together they balance service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=79, in-transit=0 \u2192 current stock likely insufficient for next period. Historical concluded lead times all 0. I set L to default (promised 0). To capture the recent uptick and reduce stockouts I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets a higher base stock based on the latest regime. This balances service (prevent lost sales during the current spike) versus holding cost given on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.
