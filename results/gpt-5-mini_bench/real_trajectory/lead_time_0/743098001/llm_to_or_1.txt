Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 32.8 units and moderate variability; no concluded arrivals or observed lead-times yet. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to cover current-period demand. No sustained changepoint or delayed shipments observed, so use promised lead time and historical-sample-based demand/volatility estimates to let the OR backend compute base-stock balancing $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows the P1 order (43) arrived in P1 (observed lead_time=0) and demand=20, leaving 23 on-hand. No evidence of demand regime shift in the historical weekly samples (33,32,51,28,20); seasonally mid-February demand appears stable. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (recent observation = 0). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given no sustained changepoint and current low pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 in Periods 1\u20132 (orders arrived same period). On-hand=18, in-transit=0, recent weekly demand samples (historical) have mean ~32.8. No overdue shipments observed. I set L by calculating average observed lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given modest demand and positive holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and stable ending on-hand (23) after recent demand. On-hand=23, in-transit=0 so current availability is sufficient for near-term demand. I set L using observed lead times to confirm actual lead time=0. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (uses the full sample set provided), balancing service level (uses empirical mean) against holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P4 arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. No evidence of lost shipments or demand regime shift (recent demands: 20,23,16,8 align with historical samples). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1-5 arrivals), so use promised/default L=0. Recent demand in concluded periods (P1-P5 sales: 20,23,16,8,10) shows a lower and slightly volatile regime vs older 2019-Jan samples; to reflect current lower demand I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the base_stock and cap are driven by recent realized sales rather than older higher samples. This keeps orders modest (reduces holding cost) while preserving service given high profit/holding ratio ($4 profit vs $1 holding).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P6) shows steady arrivals with actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in Period 4 insight) and no lost shipments. Demand recent weeks: 20,23,16,8,10,7 plus earlier weekly samples (33,32,51,28,20). I choose default lead time to trust promised L=0 and use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchor conservative by blending full-sample demand history while leveraging confirmed same-period replenishment to avoid extra pipeline padding.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand history shows a large spike in Period 7 (59 units) after several low weeks (P4-6: 8,10,7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (P1\u2013P5, P7 arrivals same period); therefore set L via observed average. For demand forecast I detect a possible regime change due to the P7 spike but limited confirmation\u2014use a short recent window to capture elevated demand while remaining responsive: mu_hat recent_N with N=3 (uses P5\u2013P7). To capture increased volatility from the spike use sigma_hat recent_N N=3. These choices increase target base-stock to cover the recent surge while keeping responsiveness to revert if spike was transient.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand: P7=59, P8=50 (sharp uptick) but only 2 high periods so not yet a sustained regime shift. Lead time previously confirmed as 0 periods; continue to trust promised lead time. To balance higher recent demand while avoiding overstock, use EWMA for mu_hat (weights recent weeks more) with gamma=0.5 to adapt toward the spike without overreacting. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical variability across all samples. These settings give the OR engine a short-term responsive demand estimate while keeping uncertainty conservative given limited sustained evidence.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/15 (Period 10). Recent demand shows a clear upward regime over the last 3 weeks (Period7-9 demands = 59, 50, 32; recent mean ~47) after a low-demand run in Periods 3-6. On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (regime length=3), so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the most recent 3 observations. This increases target base-stock to cover the recent spike while keeping L at default=0 to leverage same-period replenishment and limit holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $66.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained demand increase starting Period 7 (demands P7\u2013P10 = 59,50,32,25; mean=41.5) vs earlier periods P1\u2013P6 mean=14. I will use promised lead time (confirmed as 0 in carry-over), and set demand forecast using recent_N over the most recent detected regime (N=4) to capture the higher demand level. Volatility will also use recent_N N=4 to reflect increased variance in the new regime. These choices raise target base-stock to meet elevated demand while the backend cap limits extreme orders, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg demand increased from 14.0 (Periods 1\u20136) to 41.5 (Periods 7\u201310), +196% (evidence: P7=59, P8=50, P9=32, P10=25).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals matched orders each concluded period). Demand regime increased starting Period 7 (P7\u2013P11 demands: 59,50,32,25,28). On-hand=27, in-transit=0; with lead time 0, current on-hand must cover this period's demand. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201311); same window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base stock to cover the sustained higher mean while keeping variability estimated from the same regime, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent confirmed lead time = 0 (carry-over). On-hand=33, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand regime shifted up at Period 7 (P7\u2013P12 demands: 59,50,32,25,28,19) \u2014 recent average ~35.5. I set L=default to use promised (and confirmed) 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 (the 6-period post-changepoint regime) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*mean of the most recent stable regime and captures recent volatility; this balances higher service level after the demand increase while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 (q=4/(4+1)=0.8 favors higher z).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 7 (carry-over noted). On-hand=16, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 0 in concluded history, so I use L=default to let backend treat lead time as promised. For demand I target the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=7 (Periods 7\u201313) to capture the elevated mean while respecting the required N choice (regime length=7 \u2192 N=7). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias inventory toward servicing the higher post-changepoint demand while keeping holding cost awareness via the OR engine's service-level cap.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P14). Demand shifted up starting Period 7 (carry-over noted). Recent periods (P7\u2013P14) form a sustained higher-demand regime (8 periods: 59,50,32,25,28,19,33,78). To capture the current elevated mean/volatility I use recent_N=8 for both demand mean and sigma (with L kept at promised=0). This raises the base-stock to cover the new regime while the OR cap limits extreme orders, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 7 (P7\u2013P15: 59,50,32,25,28,19,33,78,156) after earlier low-demand periods. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To respond to the elevated regime while avoiding extreme overstock from a single huge spike, I use: L=default (promised 0, confirmed historically), mu_hat=recent_N using the most recent regime (capture current higher mean), sigma_hat=recent_N using same recent window to reflect recent volatility. I choose N=9 (P7\u2013P15 regime length=9) so the OR backend computes base stock and cap from recent elevated mean/variance and balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while covering the (1+L) review+lead horizon. This also accounts for zero pipeline and immediate need to replenish.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a clear, sustained upward shift starting Period 14 (P14=78, P15=156, P16=165). Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (observed arrivals same period). To respond to the new high-demand regime while avoiding excessive inventory, set L to default (promised 0). Forecast demand using recent_N=3 to capture the current elevated mean (reflects P14\u2013P16), and set sigma_hat using recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This raises base-stock to service the new peak while the capped order cap limits extreme over-ordering relative to holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg increased to 133.0 (Periods 14\u201316: 78,156,165) from prior ~41.5 (Periods 7\u201310), +220% (evidence: P14=78, P15=156, P16=165).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals Periods 1\u201317). Demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 14 (P14=78, P15=156, P16=165, P17=153); expect elevated demand continuing. On-hand =21, in-transit=0, so order should cover (1+L) periods of this higher demand. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because arrivals have consistently matched promises. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 14\u201317) to capture the new high-demand regime; same recent_N N=4 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices push mu_hat up to satisfy service for the higher regime while sigma_hat based on recent volatility avoids underestimating risk, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand regime: sustained high-demand regime started Period 14 (P14\u2013P18 demands = 78,156,165,153,38) with elevated mean but clear volatility. To capture the recent elevated mean and volatility while keeping responsiveness, set L to the observed average lead time and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (uses last 5 periods to reflect current regime). This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent spike while sigma_hat captures increased variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=107, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistently actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (high, volatile weekly demand). To keep the OR engine responsive to the new higher-demand regime while limiting holding cost, set lead time estimate from observed data and use recent-window demand statistics covering the post-changepoint regime. Selected: L by calculate (uses observed lead times, confirms 0); mu_hat recent_N with N=6 (uses last 6 demand samples: Periods 14\u201319) to capture current mean over (1+L) review+lead; sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward the higher recent demand while avoiding inflating safety stock from older low-demand history.

Recent demand (Periods 17-20 = 153, 38, 59, 57) remains elevated vs early history and is volatile; to capture the most relevant recent mean/variance while dampening older low-demand regimes, I use a recent-N demand estimate. I choose N=5 (most recent 5 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets base-stock reflecting current elevated, variable demand while using promised lead time=0 to avoid introducing artificial delays.

Demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 14 (P14\u2013P22 high values, recent demands: 153,38,59,57,93,97), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current elevated mean and volatility. Set L=default to trust observed same-period arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (regime from P14\u2013P22, length=9) so the OR backend targets service for the current high-demand regime while sigma reflects recent volatility, balancing profit-driven service level versus holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P23 arrivals). Demand has been in a high, volatile regime since Period 14; recent weeks (P19\u2013P23 demands = 59,57,93,97,108) show a somewhat lower but still elevated average. To balance service vs holding cost given zero lead time and recent elevated demand, I use L=default (promised 0), mu_hat based on the most recent 5 periods to capture current demand level, and sigma_hat based on the same 5 periods to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the current high-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand history.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 14 (sustained higher demand through Period 24). Promised lead time is 0 and historically confirmed as 0. I set L=default to trust promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent elevated regime to capture the new higher mean and volatility: regime spans Periods 14\u201324 (11 samples), so N=11. recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat will let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on those 11 latest high-demand observations, producing higher base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been elevated since the regime starting ~Period 17; last 9 demand observations (P17\u2013P25) show sustained high weekly sales (mixed but centered higher than earlier regimes). On-hand=66, in-transit=0 so no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0; use default promised L. To react to the recent high-demand regime while limiting holding cost, set demand forecast using recent data: use recent_N over the last 9 periods to capture the current elevated mean and variability. sigma_hat also uses recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine to a higher base stock appropriate for the new regime while keeping safety stock aligned to recent variability.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P26). Demand shifted up at Period 14 and has stayed at the higher regime through Period 26; use the recent high-regime data to forecast. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since concluded arrivals confirm 0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 14\u201326) to capture the sustained higher mean and volatility; N=13 = regime length. This focuses the base-stock on the current demand regime and avoids understocking while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): recent demand has been in the high regime since Period 14 (sustained high weekly sales). On-hand=26, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current and future high-demand weeks. Use promised lead time (confirmed LT=0 historically). For demand forecast use recent_N over the current high-demand regime to capture elevated mean: choose N=14 (Periods 14\u201327 available, regime_length=14). Use same recent_N window for sigma to capture current volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine to a higher base-stock matching the sustained uplift while keeping variability estimate aligned with recent data to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 14 (weeks 14\u201328 demand elevated, avg >> earlier periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the current high-demand regime. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (confirmed earlier), so use promised/default lead time. For demand I use recent_N to capture the post-regime-shift mean/volatility (regime from P14\u2013P28, 15 periods); this keeps the forecast responsive to the sustained higher sales. sigma_hat also uses recent_N with same N to reflect current volatility. These parameters feed the OR base-stock to raise targets for the higher-demand regime while the lead time=0 keeps replenishment immediate and avoids inflated multi-period safety stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals each period). Recent demand regime since Period 14 is elevated and sustained (many weeks of 70\u2013137+ units; regime length P14\u2013P29 = 16). To reflect the high recent mean/volatility, set L to default (promised 0, supported by concluded arrivals) and use recent_N (N=16) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base_stock and cap on the most recent high-demand regime. This choice helps the engine hold enough stock for the (1+L) review+lead window while letting the backend compute the appropriate safety stock given profit/holding costs. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 14 (Periods 14\u201330 show consistently elevated weekly demand vs early periods). To cover review+lead demand while avoiding excess holding cost, I keep L=default (promised=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent high-demand regime. I use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 14\u201330) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and volatility reflecting the sustained higher demand and recent variability; this raises the base-stock and safety stock appropriately given profit/holding tradeoff and current near-zero inventory.

Demand has been in the high regime since Period 14 (P14\u2013P31 = 18 weeks) so I use recent data from that regime. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=18 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 18 observed demands (Periods 14\u201331) to capture the sustained higher demand. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=18 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P32 arrivals same period). Recent demand has settled into a higher regime since mid-2019; last 5 concluded demands (P28\u2013P32) = [137,123,132,95,76], recent mean \u2248112.6 units. I choose L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (consistent concluded evidence). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current elevated demand regime without diluting with older low-demand periods. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to a base-stock matched to the current high-demand regime (improving service) while using recent volatility to avoid excessive overstock given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-09-30. Recent demand regime (confirmed earlier at Period 14) shows substantially higher weekly demand (~78\u2013165 then sustained ~100s through Sept). On-hand=18, in-transit=0 \u2014 low vs. recent weekly demand (~117 in P33). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes, so keep promised lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime, use recent_N over the last 20 periods (Periods 14\u201333) for both demand mean and volatility to set base stock and safety stock; this balances higher service-level need against holding cost given on-hand is currently small.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show sustained high-demand regime since Period 14 (P14\u2013P34 demand largely elevated vs earlier periods; Periods 14\u201316 avg=133 and subsequent weeks remain high). Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods. To capture the recent high-demand regime, I use recent_N=20 for demand mean and std (covers the most recent ~20 weeks since the regime change) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current volatility and level. L set to default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with observed arrivals. This balances service (use recent high-demand data to avoid stockouts) against holding cost by not inflating lead time.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0 (orders arrived same period throughout history). Recent demand (Periods 31\u201335 = 95,76,117,90,63) indicates a stable, lower post-peak regime vs earlier summer spikes. I keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (weeks of Sep\u2013Oct) so mu_hat reflects current lower weekly demand. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so variability matches recent observations. These settings reduce overstock risk relative to summer peaks while keeping service for current demand; they align with zero actual lead time so orders replenish same period.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand has been in a high regime since Period 14, but that regime is already recorded in carry-over insights. Profit $4 vs holding $1 implies q=0.8 (higher service level) so keep standard demand estimates and let OR backend compute base stock and caps using observed statistics. I choose default lead time (use promised 0) and default demand moments so the OR engine uses all historical samples to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat for the (1+L) review+lead horizon; this avoids overfitting to short-term noise while respecting the confirmed zero lead time and high service requirement.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments); recent demand (Periods 31\u201337 = 95,76,117,90,63,46,89) averages \u224882 units/week. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 target service quantile high), I use recent demand to reflect the current high-demand regime and preserve responsiveness with lead time = promised (default). Chosen: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat from recent_N to capture the most recent 7 weeks; sigma_hat from recent_N (same 7 weeks) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (sustained evidence P1\u2013P38). Demand experienced sustained upward regime starting Period 14 (P14\u2013P38 elevated vs P1\u2013P13). To capture the recent high-demand regime, I use recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent 20 demand samples, limited to 20 per rules) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base-stock on the current higher mean and volatility. L uses default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0. This balances service (respond to higher demand) while keeping holding pressure controlled by using only recent data rather than entire history.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed Periods 1\u201339). Demand has shifted upward and stayed elevated since the regime starting around Period 14; to bias the forecast toward recent higher demand I use a recent_N demand estimate (captures recent 20 weeks). Using recent volatility likewise captures current variability. This keeps promised lead time (0) while raising the base-stock to cover the sustained higher demand, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P40), so keep promised lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 14 (sustained weeks of elevated demand); to capture recent demand level and volatility I use recent_N over the most recent 20 samples to make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the post-regime demand while smoothing short-term noise. This balances service (avoid stockouts in the higher-demand regime) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute a base stock from these recent estimates.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Lead time historically and recently confirmed as 0 periods. Recent demand (P36\u2013P41 = 46,89,77,65,54,68) averages ~66.5/week and appears stable relative to the latest regime. On-hand=45, in-transit=0 \u2014 pipeline is empty so order should cover upcoming weeks. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime (captures current ~60\u201370 weekly demand) so the OR backend sets a base-stock that balances service (profit $4) against $1 holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Historical lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed repeatedly P1\u2013P42 conclude). Recent demand (Periods 35\u201342 = 63,46,89,77,65,54,68,63) averages ~67.6 with moderate variability. On-hand=17, in-transit=0 so current coverage is well below expected next-period demand; profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, hold=$1 \u2192 high service target) favors replenishment toward recent demand levels. I therefore keep L as default (promised 0) and use recent_N=8 to capture the most recent stable demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine will set a high base-stock to avoid stockouts over the review+lead period.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (sustained evidence through Period 43). Recent demand (Periods 36-43) has moderated compared to earlier spikes; using a recent-window forecast captures current demand level while preserving responsiveness to any near-term changes. Choose L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time=0. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the most recent 8 observed weeks, balancing responsiveness and noise given no new sustained regime shift detected. This keeps the base-stock target aligned with current demand and limits excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 periods across many periods (no recent delays). Recent weekly demand (Periods 41\u201344) has softened (68,63,26,17) but earlier regime shifts are already recorded; no new sustained demand change (needs 3+ periods of consistent evidence). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed zero lead time and stable-but-variable demand, I select default lead time and default demand/statistics so the engine uses all historical samples to compute base stock and caps. This balances service level (captures past high-demand regimes) while avoiding overfitting to the recent short dip.

Recent demand has varied but prior carry-over insights already recorded the large upward regime shifts; no new sustained changepoint in the last periods. Given confirmed same-period arrivals, use default lead time (promised=0). Use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available historical samples; this balances service level (by reflecting full sample history including recent higher demand) against holding cost and avoids overfitting to short-term noise. No overdue or lost shipments to account for.

Recent demand (Periods 43\u201346 = 26,17,66,53) reflects a lower post-peak holiday regime with mean ~40.5; to capture the most recent regime I use a recent_N forecast over the last 4 periods (N=4). Use the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect observed recent volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to current demand while avoiding excess holding costs given current inventory and no pipeline.
