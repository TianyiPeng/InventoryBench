Running full CSV horizon: 47 periods

Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5): [58,42,40,50,60], mean ~50. Use promised lead time (default) since no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. Use default demand and volatility calculations so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances typical demand variability with the provided profit/holding tradeoff without overreacting to limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand samples average 50 units (samples: 58,42,40,50,60). Period 1 conclude shows an order of 65 arrived with lead_time=0 (promised LT=0 confirmed). On-hand=7, in-transit=0 so available coverage is low vs expected weekly demand (~50). I choose default lead time (use promised LT=0) since arrival evidence confirms 0. I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples (captures full-sample signal). This balances service level (using historical mean) against holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly mean from baseline samples =50; recent realized demands: P1=58, P2=70 showing an upward shift but only two periods of evidence (not yet sustained). Observed lead times: both concluded orders had lead_time=0, so keep promised lead time. To be responsive to the recent demand increase while not over-committing to a short two-period blip, set L to default (promised). Use an EWMA (gamma=0.5) for mu_hat to weight recent high demand more than the long-run mean. Keep sigma_hat at default to reflect baseline volatility until a sustained variance change is observed. This balances higher service (captures recent demand rise) against holding cost while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed concluded arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $759.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04): on-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times for P1-P3 are all 0, so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand samples (most relevant) are Periods 1-3 demand = [58,70,42]; I use a recent_N=3 forecast to capture the recent spike (70) while still smoothing with nearby weeks. L set by calculate to reflect observed lead time=0. mu_hat set via recent_N (N=3) to use the (1+L)-period demand based on the last 3 samples. sigma_hat set via recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the recent higher demand while avoiding overstock given low holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $800.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Concluded history (P1\u2013P4) shows all orders arrived same period (lead_time=0 each). Demand history (Jan weekly samples plus P1\u2013P4) shows no sustained regime shift. I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=0 from concluded arrivals. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while keeping safety stock consistent with historical variability.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-5) = [58,70,42,44,69] with mean \u224856.6 and no observed delivery delays (all concluded lead_times=0). On-hand and in-transit are 0, so we need orders to cover (1+L) periods. I set L to 'calculate' so backend confirms actual observed lead time average (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent regime (no sustained trend change but recent weeks include two high weeks), so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices balance service (capture recent higher weeks) while avoiding overreaction to single spikes.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order (Periods 1-6) arrived with lead_time=0 and demand samples = [58,70,42,44,69,100] (mean\u224863.8). I set L to 'calculate' to confirm actual lead time from observed concludes (average = 0). With L=0, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this balances service (using full sample mean including the recent spike to 100) against holding cost. This also avoids overreacting to a single high demand week while keeping safety stock per backend's z* formulation. No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1->arrived P1, P2->P2, P3->P3, P4->P4, P5->P5, P6->P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=33, in-transit=0. History (P1-P7) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and variable weekly demand (58,70,42,44,69,100,54). No sustained regime change (the P6 spike to 100 is isolated). Use promised/observed lead time (default) so OR backend treats review+lead=(1+0)=1 period. Use default demand estimates based on all samples to smooth isolated spikes and keep holding cost low; use default sigma to reflect full-sample variability.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0). Recent realized weekly demand (P4\u2013P8) = [44,69,100,54,57], showing a higher mean and volatility than older samples but no sustained regime change. Use promised/default lead time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current demand level and variability so the OR engine raises target inventory modestly to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost sensitivity (profit/h holding ratio) effective.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has been volatile with last five period demands = [69,100,54,57,30], on-hand=71, in-transit=0 and confirmed lead time=0 historically. I keep L as default (promised 0) since carries confirmed same-period arrivals. To reflect recent higher mean and volatility versus the older Jan samples, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stocking for the most recent demand regime while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand history shows variability with a high peak (100) then softer weeks (30,22); on-hand=82, in-transit=0 so current coverage is healthy for short lead time. Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 periods. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time, and mu_hat/sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses the full sample history to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std. This leverages all data while the confirmed 0 lead time and high unit profit vs low holding cost allow the backend to target a higher service level without large holding penalties.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201311) shows actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods and steady weekly demand samples [58,42,40,50,60,58,70,42,44,69,100,54,57,30,22,36] (historical provided plus observed sells). Current on-hand=48, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Given confirmed L=0, use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level using full-sample stats while avoiding overfitting to recent volatility (e.g., the 100 spike).

=== Period 12 Summary ===
148033001: ordered=35, arrived=35 units (ordered on Period 12, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=83, demand=55, sold=55, ending on-hand inventory=28

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Current on-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201312 arrivals same-day) so use promised lead time. Recent demand has eased from earlier peaks (e.g., P6=100) to lower, more stable values in the last 5 concluded periods (P8\u2013P12 demands = 57,30,22,36,55; mean \u224840). I treat this as the current regime and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 samples (N=5) to reflect recent mean/volatility while avoiding overstock from older high-demand spikes. L=default (0) keeps orders arriving same period; mu_hat recent_N captures the lower recent demand to reduce holding cost; sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability so the OR backend sets an appropriate safety stock balancing profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P13) consistently show arrivals same period (lead_time=0). To reflect confirmed same-day arrivals I set L by 'calculate' (avg observed lead times = 0). With L=0 I use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat = backend (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) so the OR engine uses full historical demand to set base-stock while respecting profit vs holding cost tradeoff.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201314) consistently show arrivals same period as orders \u2192 actual lead time confirmed 0. No evidence of recent demand regime shift (demands vary but show no sustained change). I choose default L to trust promised lead time (0), and default mu_hat/sigma_hat to use the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), which yields a stable base-stock given steady historical demand and avoids overfitting to short-term noise. No missing-shipment mitigation needed.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1->P1 through P7->P7 previously recorded).

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Historical concludes (P1\u2013P16) consistently show actual lead time = 0. On-hand=35, in-transit=0; recent weekly demands (last 5 samples: 55,48,22,54,45) and full history show moderate, stable demand. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no evidence of a regime shift, use default statistical aggregates so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps service levels aligned with historical demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201317) shows consistent same-period arrivals => lead time confirmed 0. Historical weekly demand samples (58,42,40,50,60) give mean=50. On-hand=59, in-transit=0 so current inventory ~1\xd7mean; no overdue shipments. Use default lead time to reflect confirmed 0. Use default mu_hat to set (1+L)\xd7mean = 50 to target average one-period demand. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so OR backend balances service level (via q from profit/holding) against holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Historical concluded data (Periods 1\u201318) show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and no lost shipments; on-hand=44, in-transit=0. Pipeline covers nothing this period, so maintain promised lead time. I choose L=default to use the confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (uses full history) against holding cost given moderate on-hand stock and steady demand.

To keep policy aligned with observed zero lead time and historical demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Profit=$19, holding=$1 implies a high target service level; with on-hand already healthy and no evidence of a regime shift, use default estimators so OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance and promised L=0.

Demand has varied but shows no sustained regime shift in the most recent 3+ periods. To keep the OR engine aligned with stable, observed same-day arrivals and full-sample demand statistics, I select default lead time and default demand dispersion/mean estimators so backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples. This balances service (using full-sample demand estimate) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed). Historical sample mean (provided) = 50 units/week. On-hand=62, in-transit=0 so current stock ~1.24\xd7 weekly mean; no overdue shipments. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since multiple conclude messages confirm 0. I choose mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)=50, reflecting baseline weekly demand. I choose sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) (~8.1) to capture observed variability. This keeps target base-stock moderate given low holding cost (1) vs profit (19) and avoids overstock while providing service against observed weekly demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P25) consistently shows actual lead time = 0; on-hand=46, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Demand history shows stable weekly demand with no sustained regime change. I select L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. I select mu_hat=sigma_hat default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, keeping estimates robust to variability and letting the OR engine set service level per cost ratio. This balances service (profit>$19 vs holding $1) while avoiding unnecessary extra stock given current on-hand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Historical concluded data (Periods 1\u201326) show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed repeatedly) and recent steady weekly demand (samples from Feb\u2013Jun: 58,42,40,50,60 and subsequent weekly demands through Period 26). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. I will trust the confirmed lead time=0 and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given holding is low ($1) and profit is high ($19). This avoids overfitting short-term noise and relies on robust historical estimate; no explicit adjustments for lost shipments are needed because arrivals have been reliable.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data (Periods 1\u201327) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Demand has been moderate and stable across recent weeks (weekly demands in history range ~10\u2013100 but recent months mostly 20\u201335). Profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1) so policy should favor service level over minimal inventory. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, producing a higher base-stock to protect service while backend cap limits extreme ordering.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (actual lead time 0 confirmed repeatedly) and stable weekly demand variability. Current on-hand=44, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To let the OR engine use full-sample demand statistics and the confirmed zero lead time, I select default lead time and default demand moments so base-stock is computed from all historical samples (balances service level driven by profit=$19 vs holding=$1). This avoids overfitting to recent weeks while reflecting the sustained lead-time regime.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (many conclude messages P1->P1 through P29->P29), on-hand=44, in-transit=0. Promised lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 0; no evidence of lost shipments or regime change in demand. Profit/hc ratio implies a high service quantile (q=19/(19+1)=0.95). I therefore use default lead time to keep the OR engine aligned with the supplier promise and use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)/sqrt(1+L)) so the backend computes base-stock and cap using full history. This balances high service level (capture profit) while relying on observed stable arrivals to avoid inflating pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P30) consistently show orders arriving same period \u2192 actual lead time stable at 0. No recent changepoint in demand. Use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history and promised lead time. This leverages ample history and confirmed 0 lead time; given profit=19 and holding=1 (q\u22480.95) the OR engine will target a high service level while default mu/sigma keep variance and demand mean fully represented.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (many concluded orders P1->P31 all with lead_time=0) and demand variability but no sustained regime change. On-hand=8, in-transit=0 so we are low on stock and need to restock. Use L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand to set a base-stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost while accounting for observed variability. This approach is conservative given no new changepoint and the confirmed 0 lead time.

No evidence of lost shipments or regime change in demand\u2014recent weeks show typical weekly variability. Use promised/default lead time (0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sharp spike in Period 33 (93) but the last 5 weeks average (Periods 29-33 = 29,31,64,39,93) is ~51.2 units. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history; use promised/default L=0. To balance service vs holding cost after the recent spike, set demand estimates based on the most recent 5 weeks (captures the uptick while limiting influence of older data). Use recent_N N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets a higher base-stock reflecting current demand and its volatility.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed across many periods). On-hand=28, in-transit=0; recent orders have arrived same period so no overdue shipments. Profit/holding yields high service quantile (q=19/20=0.95) so OR should target a high base stock. I select default methods so backend uses promised L and full-sample statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which best leverages the long, stable demand history and the confirmed 0 lead time to balance service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

No sustained demand regime change detected; demand history is stable with occasional spikes. Use default lead time (promised = 0) since confirmed repeatedly. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, letting the OR engine set base-stock against observed variability. This keeps service high (leveraging same-period replenishment) while limiting excess inventory through the backend's cap.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (through Period 37) consistently show actual lead time=0. No evidence of sustained demand regime shift in recent history. Use promised/default lead time (0) and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical data to balance service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) without overreacting to recent variability. No overdue shipments to reconcile.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed previously). Recent periods (Periods 31-38) show elevated and more volatile demand (several weeks with demand >70 and spikes to 102\u2013107), indicating a recent higher-demand regime. To capture this regime and avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs reasonable, I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the most recent weeks. L uses the default (promised) lead time = 0.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent concluded history shows frequent same-period arrivals and stable weekly demand with several high-demand spikes (e.g., Periods 31,33,35-38,39). On-hand=19, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; expected demand next period could be moderate-to-high. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods, so use default promised lead time. Use default demand and volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this leverages all historical data to set the base stock while the OR engine's cap will limit extreme orders. This balances service (capture profit $19/unit) against holding cost ($1/unit) given confirmed L=0 and no new sustained regime change.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Recent history (Periods 1\u201340 conclude) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and stable weekly demand samples from Feb\u2013Nov 2019. Current on-hand=20, in-transit=0. Given multiple confirmed arrive=ordered messages across many periods (lead time=0) and no evidence of a demand regime shift, use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*sample_mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*sample_std. This keeps policy aligned with observed data, avoids overfitting to short-term noise, and balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in prior concluded periods, on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover immediate (L+1)=1 period of demand. Recent weeks (Periods ~31-41) show elevated and more volatile demand versus early-year baseline (several large weekly spikes in Sep\u2013Nov). To capture the recent regime, set L=default (promised 0), use recent_N on demand to bias the forecast to the last N weeks (reflecting the late-season spike) and match volatility with recent_N as well; this reduces stockouts during the current high-demand window while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed in prior carry-overs) and the demand history shows variable weekly demand with recent large spikes (e.g., P42 demand=159) but no sustained regime change. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (captures long-run mean/volatility) against holding cost given no strong evidence to shift forecasts or volatility heuristics now.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0 in concluded history (P1->P1 through P43->P43). Recent demand shows a sustained high regime starting around Period 39 (demands P39-P43 = 97,70,92,159,85; 5-period mean = 100.6), significantly above prior typical weeks. To capture the elevated demand through the review+lead horizon while respecting confirmed zero lead time, I use L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to make the OR backend forecast based on the most recent high-demand regime (reduces stockouts in this high-demand window while avoiding overstating long-term volatility). No evidence of delayed/lost shipments to adjust lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 39-44) show elevated and volatile demand (97,70,92,159,85,132) consistent with holiday-season uplift. Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 0 in concluded history. To capture the recent higher demand regime, I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock appropriate for the last 6 weeks' mean and volatility, balancing service level during the holiday spike against holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (carry-over confirmations). Recent demand has materially risen since early Nov; last 8 concluded weekly demands (P38\u2013P45) average ~114.9 units, well above long-run mean. No overdue shipments to reconcile. Set L=default to trust confirmed 0-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent elevated, higher-variance regime around Nov\u2013Dec so the OR engine raises the base-stock and safety stock to protect service during this high-demand holiday period while controlling holding cost via a targeted recent-window estimate.

On-hand=45, in-transit=0; with lead time historically confirmed as 0, arrivals are same-period. To capture the recent elevated demand and higher variance, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the last 5 weeks of elevated holiday demand, improving service during the spike while the OR backend balances holding cost via its cap.
