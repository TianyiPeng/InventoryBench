No concluded arrivals exist so actual lead time is unknown; supplier promised LT=0 but may be longer. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision rule: promised LT=0 implies orders could arrive in-period and satisfy current demand, but because actual LT is unconfirmed and lost shipments possible, we balance service level vs. holding cost.
