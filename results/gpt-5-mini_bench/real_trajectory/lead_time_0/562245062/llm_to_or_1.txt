Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent observed weekly demand shows a clear upward run over five samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04: 59,78,96,123,144; mean=100). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for current period demand plus safety. No concluded arrivals exist to infer lead-time, so keep L as promised (default). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent rising regime. Use sigma_hat default (all-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) since variance estimate from full history is acceptable and we lack contradictory evidence. This raises the backend base-stock to reflect higher recent mean while letting the OR cap limit extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: Recent 5-week rising demand (2019-01-07..2019-02-04): samples 59,78,96,123,144; mean=100 \u2014 sustained increase over \u22653 periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. SKU 562245062 has on-hand=22, in-transit=0. Period1 concluded that an order placed in P1 arrived with lead_time=0 (observed actual=0). Demand history shows a sustained recent 5-week rising regime (samples 59,78,96,123,144; mean=100). To capture the recent higher demand we set L using observed lead times, and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat reflects the recent regime while sigma_hat captures recent variability. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given current low pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04 = 59,78,96,123,144) show a sustained rising regime (5-week mean=100). Observed conclude messages for Periods 1\u20132 show orders arriving same period (arrived=ordered, lead_time=0) so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Current inventory: on-hand=56, in-transit=0. To capture the recent upward demand while respecting confirmed zero lead time, set L via calculate (average observed lead times=0), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 samples, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the confirmed higher demand while keeping holding cost trade-off explicit to the OR backend.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show a sustained 5-week rising demand (mean=100). Concluded orders show actual lead_time=0 for three observed orders. I set L using calculate to confirm observed lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent 5-week rising regime (balances service level vs holding cost). Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility rather than older data.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent 5-week data (59,78,96,123,144) shows a sustained rising demand (mean=100). On-hand=66, in-transit=0 so no pending arrivals; ending inventory relatively low vs. recent demand. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times. To capture the recent upward regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a higher base-stock reflecting the new mean and volatility while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0 (all concluded orders had W=0). Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show a sustained rising regime; last 5-week mean=100. On-hand=65, in-transit=0 so we should target cover for (1+L) review+lead =1 period. Set L by calculation of observed lead times to capture confirmed 0 lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the recent elevated demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5 samples). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in check given low lead time and existing on-hand inventory.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded demands (Periods 2-6 = 75,52,66,55,58) show a sustained lower-demand regime vs. the earlier 5-week rise noted previously. All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (orders placed in Period X arrived in Period X). On-hand=32, in-transit=0, so we need to replenish for (1+L) review+lead period coverage. Set L to default (promised 0) since concluded history confirms lead time 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus forecast on the most recent 5-period regime (Periods 2-6 mean \u224861.2) and reduce bias from the early spike. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend toward an order targeting the current lower-demand regime, balancing service (profit $4) vs holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2-6: avg demand = 61.2 (Periods 2-6) vs prior 5-week mean=100 (Periods 2019-01-07..2019-02-04); sustained lower regime over 5 periods (-38.8%).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has settled into a lower regime vs the initial 5-week spike: latest demands (Periods 3-7) = 52,66,55,58,55 (avg \u224857). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (Periods 1-7), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. On-hand=15, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime (use last 5 demand samples) so the OR engine computes a (1+L)-period forecast and volatility around the current demand level, reducing excess holding while maintaining service.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no incoming coverage. Historical concluded demands show an earlier high regime (Jan weeks mean=100) then a sustained lower regime since Periods 2\u20138 (recent five concluded demands P4\u2013P8 = 66,55,58,55,64; mean\u224859.6). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so use default promised L. To capture the recently confirmed lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (focuses the forecast on the current lower mean/volatility). This reduces overstock risk versus using the older high-demand mean while allowing the OR backend to compute a base stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

On-hand=12, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0. Set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. Forecast demand across review+lead using recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained lower regime and avoid overstock given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (high service target but moderate holding cost). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability. These parameters bias orders toward covering the (1+L)\xd7recent mean while limiting excess inventory.

To reflect the confirmed same-period arrivals I set L by calculating observed lead times. To be responsive to the recent lower-demand regime and limit holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent N=5 weeks (captures current mean/volatility); with L=0 this produces a modest base stock that balances service level (using recent demand mean and variability) against the $1 holding cost and $4 profit per unit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent demand has fallen: Periods 8-12 demands = [64,52,43,38,27], recent 5-week mean=44.8 (sustained decline over 5 periods). To avoid overstock, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new low-demand regime. Volatility also appears lower recently, so set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture current variability. These choices reduce target base-stock and holding cost while preserving service for the current lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8-12: avg demand decreased from 61.2 (Periods 2-6) to 44.8 (Periods 8-12), \u221226.8%.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude records (Periods 1\u201313) show every order arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 consistently) so I set L using observed average. Recent demand has been in a lower regime vs early Feb; last 5 demands (Periods 9\u201313 = 52,43,38,27,59) reflect the most relevant recent mean for forecasting while capturing short-run volatility. Using recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps the forecast responsive to the recent downshift while limiting holding cost given low on-hand inventory and modest profit/holding ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all past orders arrived with lead_time=0 (consistent). Demand has shifted from earlier high to a lower recent regime; last 5 demand observations (Periods 10-14) = 43,38,27,59,63 (mean\u224846). To reflect the most recent regime and keep service with limited holding cost, set L=default (promised 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals) and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std \u2014 capturing current lower mean and volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in Periods 1-15 all arrived same period). Recent demand shows regime variability: earlier rise (Periods 1-5), drop (Periods 8-12), then stronger demand in the last 3 periods (Periods 13-15). To be responsive to the most recent regime while retaining statistical stability, I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times (reflecting confirmed actual lead time=0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability based on the last 5 concluded demand samples, capturing the latest demand level without overreacting to a 3-period blip. This balances service (meeting recent higher demand) against holding cost by tightening forecast horizon to recent data.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows observed lead times = 0 in all concluded periods; on-hand=21, in-transit=0. Demand has exhibited multiple regime shifts; recent weeks (Periods 12-16 demands = 27,59,63,74,48) are uneven but represent the best short-term signal. Profit=$4, holding=$1 implies a high service quantile (q=0.8). I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (puts weight on latest mixed but relevant weeks), which helps the OR backend produce a base-stock aligned with current demand while limiting excess holding given elevated holding cost relative to profit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Observed lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history (orders placed each period arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 13-17 = 59,63,74,48,34; mean=55.6) shows a moderately higher short-run mean than the earlier low regime; I use recent_N with N=5 for demand forecast to capture the latest regime and volatility. This balances service (use recent mean to avoid stockouts after recent spikes) against holding cost given profit/holding implies a high service quantile (q=0.8).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent history shows a sustained downshift from the early high-demand weeks; most recent 5 demands (Periods 14-18 = 63,74,48,34,39) average ~51.6, suggesting lower current regime. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (no delays). I therefore use the promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current regime. This keeps target base_stock responsive to the lower recent demand while preserving service vs. holding tradeoff given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Actual observed lead times in history are consistently 0, so use default promised L. Set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime and avoid overstock; set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility.

On-hand=50, in-transit=0 and historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders have arrived same period). To avoid excess holding cost while meeting current lower demand, use promised lead time (default=0) and set demand forecast & volatility using the most recent 5-week regime (recent_N N=5) so the OR backend will target a smaller base-stock appropriate for the lower demand environment.

Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded lead_times have been 0 throughout, so use default promised L. To avoid overstocking given the clear downward regime in recent weeks, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (captures the most recent low-demand regime).

Recent demand has fallen materially: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 19-23) = [25,10,9,26,35], mean=21.0, well below earlier regime (~44.8). To reflect the recent low-demand regime and keep stock lean vs holding cost, use L=default (promised=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the OR forecast on the most recent demand behavior.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19-23: avg demand dropped to 21.0 (Periods 19-23) from prior 44.8 (Periods 8-12), \u221253.1%.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Current on-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead_time = 0 (all recent orders arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand has settled much lower; last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 20-24) = [10,9,26,35,17], mean=19.4 and reduced volatility versus earlier regimes. To reflect the new low-demand regime and limit holding cost while keeping service, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 weeks so the OR backend targets ~1 period of forecasted demand at an appropriate safety buffer.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (all past orders arrived same period). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime; the last 5 demand samples (Periods 21-25 = 9,26,35,17,41) average ~25.6. No overdue or lost shipments to reconcile. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (matches observed). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime and keep forecast volatility aligned to recent variability; N=5 since the recent regime length is 5 periods. These parameters bias the OR backend toward lower target inventory, reducing holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Recent demand shows lower level than early-year spike; most recent 5-week demand (Periods 22-26 = 26,35,17,41,58) mean ~35.4 with mixed volatility. Use promised lead time (default=0). Use recent 5 weeks to set mu_hat to capture current regime and reduce inventory risk vs. earlier high-demand periods. Use recent 5 weeks for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock responsive to current variability.

Recent demand (Periods 23-27 = 35,17,41,58,91) shows elevated and volatile demand with a sharp spike in Period 27 but only two high weeks\u2014no confirmed >=3-period regime shift yet. To balance service vs holding cost I keep promised lead time (default L=0) but use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the most recent upward trend and volatility for safety in the base-stock calculation.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent five-week demand (Periods 24-28 demands = 17,41,58,91,87) shows elevated volatility with mean \u224858.8. Use L=default (promised lead time 0). Set mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to target (1+L)*recent mean and respond to latest regime. Set sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture current volatility for safety stock calculation. This balances service (respond to recent spike) vs holding cost given zero inventory and same-period arrivals.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 \u2192 keep L as promised (default). Recent demand (Periods 25-29 = 41,58,91,87,72) shows a sustained 5-week upswing vs prior low regime (Periods 19-23 mean=21). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher mean and elevated volatility so the backend's base-stock and cap reflect the latest regime and avoid underordering given low pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25-29: avg demand = 69.8 (Periods 25-29) vs prior 19-23 avg = 21.0 (+232%), sustained over 5 weeks.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Demand recently shifted up (Periods 25-30 avg \u2248 70) vs earlier low regime; to capture current high regime I forecast using the most recent 5 weeks. Therefore: L = default (promised 0). mu_hat = recent_N with N=5 to target the recent high-demand regime. sigma_hat = recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise the backend base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the recent higher demand while keeping variability estimate tied to the same recent sample set.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all past orders arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand has risen sharply over the last 5 weeks (Periods 27-31: demands 91,87,72,89,101; recent 5-week mean \u224888) indicating a higher demand regime; use a recent_N forecast to capture this shift. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent variability. These choices raise the backend base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period under the new high-demand regime while sigma based on recent variability supports an appropriate safety stock tradeoff given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Demand has returned to a sustained higher regime since Period 25 (Periods 25-32 show high weekly demand; regime length = 8). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices keep the base-stock keyed to the recent high-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand periods, balancing service level versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) for many periods \u2192 no evidence of delays or losses. Demand has risen sharply in the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 29-33); to capture this regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR base-stock reflects the new higher demand while L remains the promised/observed 0. This balances service (capture current high demand) against holding cost by not overreacting to older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29-33: avg demand = 102.4 (Periods 29-33) vs prior Periods 25-29 avg = 69.8 (+46.6%), sustained over 5 weeks

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has rebounded and is high: Periods 30-34 demand = 89,101,101,149,131 (5-week mean \u2248114). All observed lead times historically are 0 (orders arrive same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because concluded history shows consistent 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (most recent 5 weeks mean \u2248114) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability and ensure safety stock scales to current variance. These choices prioritize service during the sustained recent spike while keeping holding cost exposure limited because lead time is 0 and inventory turns are rapid.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (all concluded orders arrived same period), so I set L via calculate to confirm average observed lead time=0. Recent demand (Periods 31-35 = 101,101,149,131,115) is markedly above long-run mean; to capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the recent spike while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, and recent demand has risen sharply (Periods 32-36 demands: 101,149,131,115,130; mean ~125.2). I set lead time to the observed average (calculate=0) and forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the sustained high-demand regime; volatility likewise uses the recent 5 samples. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet current elevated demand while CPO caps will limit extreme orders and control holding cost.

Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so use default L. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest high-demand regime and recent volatility; this biases orders toward meeting high near-term demand while the OR backend will cap orders to control inventory given profit=$4 vs holding=$1 (target service quantile \u22480.8).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): on-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (every concluded arrival shows lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. Demand has rebounded sharply in recent weeks (Periods 34-38 demands = 131,115,130,132,113; recent 5-week mean \u2248124). To capture the current high-demand regime while limiting hold cost, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Volatility should also reflect the same recent window (recent_N N=5) so the OR engine sizes safety stock to observed short-term variability. This balances higher service level needed for current surge against holding cost given on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=53, in-transit=0.

Use promised lead time (default L=0). Forecast demand over review+lead = recent 5-week mean to capture the current high-demand regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand periods. Use recent 5-week volatility for sigma to reflect current variability. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given moderate on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Recent demand (Periods 37-41 sold = 132,113,80,68,70) shows current regime average \u224892.6 and noticeable volatility; with no in-transit stock I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets supply to the most recent demand regime and balances service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). History shows consistently observed lead_time = 0 in concluded messages; no recent sustained lead-time shifts. Demand had a large one-week spike in Period 42 (327) likely a promotional/Black Friday event; this is a single-period spike not yet sustained. To avoid overreacting to the spike while remaining responsive, keep promised lead time (default) and use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to smooth recent demand including the spike. Use default sigma_hat to let backend scale volatility over (1+L). This balances service level (responsive to recent increases) versus holding cost risk from the isolated spike.

Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=161, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a strong short holiday spike (Period 42 demand=327) followed by elevated demand (P43=133). Historical observed lead time has been 0 every concluded period, so keep L as promised (default). To respond to the recent higher-demand regime while avoiding excessive inventory, set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 weeks) to capture the current elevated mean (N=5). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility including the spike. These choices let the OR backend increase target base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while the recent volatility increases safety stock appropriately.

Recent history shows a large, short-lived spike (Period 42 demand=327) followed by high replenishment (ordered=294 in P43) and moderate sales (P43-P44). Promised and observed lead times have been 0 throughout history, so use default lead time. To capture the current demand level and elevated short-term volatility I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (covers Periods 40-44: demands 68,70,327,133,54) so the OR backend targets service reflecting immediate demand patterns while the cap will limit excessive orders. This balances higher short-term demand risk (including the recent spike) against holding cost given large on-hand stock.

Recent demand history shows a large spike at Period 42 (327) followed by a large replenishment (ordered 294 in P43) leaving current on-hand=163 and in-transit=0. Given high on-hand inventory (holding cost $1 vs profit $4 -> target service level q=0.8) and no evidence of lead-time degradation or new sustained demand regime, use default lead time and population-wide demand estimates so the OR backend's base-stock is conservative and avoids additional holding cost while preserving service. Defaults let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples; this balances service vs holding given current overstock and no in-transit units.

Promised and observed lead time = 0 historically, so use default lead time. To capture very recent demand mix I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to let OR backend weight the last 5 weeks (including the spike) when computing base_stock; sigma_hat kept as default to reflect overall historical variability. This balances high service level (profit/holding => q=0.8) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory and recent volatility.
