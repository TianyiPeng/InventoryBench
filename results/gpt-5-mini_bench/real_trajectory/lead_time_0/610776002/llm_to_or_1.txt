Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand shows a recent upward shift (148,175,160,233,308) with the last 3 weeks averaging higher than the full-sample mean. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; promised lead time is 0. To respond to the apparent regime increase while avoiding overreaction to a single spike, I set L to 'default' (use promised lead time=0), set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher mean over the review+lead period, and set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This emphasizes service (captures the recent demand rise) while keeping safety stock tied to recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: full-sample mean=204.8 (Periods 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) vs recent-3 mean=233.67 (+14%), sustained over last 3 periods (160,233,308).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent demand has increased vs full-sample: last 3 demands = 160, 233, 308 (recent-3 mean=233.67, full mean=204.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and last period an order of 234 placed in P1 arrived with actual lead time 0. I use default promised lead time (L=default) since observed lead time confirms 0. To capture the recent higher regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures the sustained 3-period uptick). For demand variability use recent_N N=3 as well to reflect current volatility. These parameters raise target base-stock to satisfy the higher short-run demand while keeping variability aligned to recent experience, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent weeks show a sustained uptick (last 3 samples: 160,233,308; recent-3 mean=233.7 vs full-sample mean=204.8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and prior two concludes show orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived with lead_time=0 (consistent). I set L by average observed lead times to keep promised=actual (method: calculate). For demand I bias the forecast toward the recent higher regime using recent_N (N=3) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(last3) to better cover the uplift. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture current volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service given zero on-hand/pipeline while limiting excess holding by using a short recent window.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand shows a sustained upward shift: last 3 demands = 160, 233, 308 (recent-3 mean=233.67 vs full-sample mean=204.8). Observed concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed in P1-P3 arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed upward regime and avoid understocking. For sigma I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These params raise the base-stock and increase service level to reduce lost sales while accepting holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $270.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime: last 3 sample demands = 160,233,308 (recent-3 mean=233.67) vs full-sample mean=204.8. On-hand=13, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods (orders in P1\u2013P4 all arrived with W=0). Because the most recent 3 weeks show a clear upward shift, I set demand forecast methods to recent_N (N=3) to capture the new regime while keeping lead time estimation data-driven. This balances service level (respond to higher recent demand) against holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1), where the backend will compute safety stock accordingly.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Observed lead time confirmed 0 in all concluded periods (P1\u2013P5). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime: last 3 demands = {160,233,308} -> recent-3 mean +14% vs full-sample. On-hand=50, in-transit=0 and no missing shipments. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) since concluded history confirms it. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent upward demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead window. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings raise the base-stock to match the higher recent demand while sigma from recent data moderates safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1-6) show observed lead_time=0 each period; use calculate to confirm actual L=0. Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime over the last 3 periods (Periods 4-6 demand = 283,252,270; recent-3 mean=268.33 vs earlier full-sample lower mean), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the elevated short-term mean and volatility. This raises the backend base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window while limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1-7). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained uptick over the last 3 concluded periods (Periods 5-7 demands = 252, 270, 364; recent-3 mean = 295.33 vs full-sample mean 204.8). To respond to the confirmed higher demand while actual lead time remains 0, set L by calculating observed lead times and set demand forecast using the recent-3 regime. This raises the base_stock to cover (1+L)\xd7recent demand and uses recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8: recent-3 mean=295.33 (Periods 5-7: 252,270,364) vs full-sample mean=204.8 (+44%), sustained over last 3 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 periods (orders placed each period arrived same period). Demand has shifted up recently: last 3 concluded demands = 270, 364, 372 (mean \u2248335.33), higher than full-sample mean (204.8). To reflect the recent higher demand and keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I set lead time to the observed average (calculate). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean with L=0). I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base stock consistent with the sustained recent demand spike while keeping volatility estimate local to recent behavior.

Recent demand has shifted up: last 3 demands = 364, 372, 271 (recent-3 mean \u2248 335.7) sustained over 3 periods vs full-sample mean 204.8. To respond to the higher regime and keep service while avoiding excess holding, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures the new higher mean and volatility). No evidence of lost shipments, so default lead time is appropriate. These choices raise the base-stock to reflect the new demand regime while keeping safety sizing tied to recent volatility, balancing fill rate and holding cost given profit=holding.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and Period 11 showed a large realized demand spike (564) on top of elevated recent demand (Periods 9-11: 271, 310, 564). Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 0. I therefore keep L as default (promised 0) and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent high-demand regime (three-week window) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to cover the current spike while reflecting recent volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been elevated vs full-sample (noted regime shift earlier around Period 8). To respond to persistently higher recent demand while avoiding excessive holding, I set lead time to default (promised=0, historically observed 0). I forecast demand using recent_N (last 5 weeks) to capture the elevated demand level without overfitting a single spike, and estimate volatility from the same recent window. These parameters give the OR backend a short lead-time view plus a demand mean/variance anchored to the latest regime, balancing service (higher fill) against holding costs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Observed lead times have been consistently 0 in all concluded periods, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has materially increased vs full-sample (recent spikes; last 3 demands = 564, 424, 304). To capture the elevated regime and reduce stockouts, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 samples (N=3). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility feeding the OR engine, improving service while the backend caps orders to limit excess inventory.

Recent demand elevated: last 3 demands (Periods 12-14) = 424, 304, 431 (mean \u2248386). To respond to the sustained higher-demand regime and avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind, use promised lead time (default=0) and set demand forecast using recent-3 samples.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime vs full-sample (recent 3-7 weeks avg ~350 vs full-sample mean 204.8). Historical concludes show lead_time=0 consistently. To respond to the confirmed higher demand I use a short recent window to raise forecast mean and volatility while keeping promised lead time. Chosen: L=default (promised 0). mu_hat: recent_N N=5 to capture the recent elevated demand regime (balances responsiveness vs noise). sigma_hat: recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand period while sigma increase preserves safety stock against variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed higher recent demand regime and short recent variance; this supplies the OR engine a (1+L)-period forecast anchored to the most relevant regime, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent actual lead time of 0 (all orders P1\u2013P17 arrived same period). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 8 and remains elevated; to capture this sustained shift I use recent data from the entire post-changepoint regime (Periods 8\u201317, length=10). Therefore: keep L as default (promised=0, consistent with observed arrivals), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to reflect the elevated mean and recent volatility, which raises base-stock to meet higher demand while limiting excess inventory by using only the recent regime for estimates.

Recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 3 concluded demands: 435, 640, 419) indicating a higher recent mean than the full sample. I set L=default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent high-demand regime and higher volatility; this raises the backend base-stock and safety buffer to avoid lost sales while limiting excess holding by using only the most recent 3 samples rather than full-sample smoothing.

Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime in the last 3 periods. Keep L as default (promised lead time = 0).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 3 periods to reflect the current high-demand regime and its volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a higher base-stock appropriate to recent demand while sigma from recent-3 captures current variability.

To match current elevated demand while keeping inventory risk controlled, set L to promised (default=0), set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so I keep L = promised (0). Recent demand has been volatile after a mid-year peak (Periods 16-19) but the last 4 observations are 439,301,232,238 \u2014 indicating demand has moved down from peak. To balance service vs holding cost I bias the forecast toward recent data to reflect the current lower average while still capturing short-term variability. Therefore I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent regime-length sample window.

Recent demand shows a cooler summer pattern vs spring peaks; last 3 concluded demands (Periods 21-23) = 232, 238, 212 -> recent mean ~227.33. Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current regime and reduce overweighting earlier high peaks. This balances service (cover next period demand) while limiting holding cost given on-hand stock and downward demand trend.

No evidence of changed lead time (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically). To avoid excess holding cost while matching recent lower demand, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 3 periods (captures current summer regime). This keeps orders responsive to recent demand drop and limits holding exposure.

On-hand=65, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (all concluded lead_times=0). To keep service while avoiding extra holding (profit=holding so q=0.5 -> z*=0), set L=default (promised 0). Use recent-3 demand to adapt to the current lower regime: mu_hat recent_N N=3 -> (1+L)*mean_recent3 = 191. Capture volatility from the same recent window: sigma_hat recent_N N=3. This balances service vs holding given equal profit/holding and current on-hand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=89, in-transit=0. Recent demand has trended down over the last 3 weeks (Periods 24-26: 207, 154, 102), suggesting a short-term lower-demand regime versus the earlier high peaks. No recent evidence of lead-time changes (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically). To adapt quickly to the recent decline while avoiding excess holding cost, set L to default (promised lead time=0) and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent 3-period demand pattern (N=3 chosen because the last 3 periods show a clear downward shift and meets the minimum sample size). This reduces target base-stock to match current demand and limits holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=35, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments (all concluded lead_times=0 historically). Recent demand has dropped: Periods 25-27 demand = [154,102,120], recent-3 mean=125.33, down sharply from prior weeks (~219). I set L=default (promised 0; observed lead_time=0 throughout). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new low-demand regime and avoid overstock. For sigma I use recent_N N=3 to reflect reduced volatility in the latest regime. These choices lower target base-stock to reduce holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: recent-3 mean=125.33 (Periods 25-27: 154,102,120) vs prior recent-3 mean=219 (Periods 22-24: 238,212,207), a -43% drop, sustained 3 periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand shows a sustained lower regime detected in prior carry-over (Periods 25-27: 154,102,120) though Week 28 demand=158 (stockout limited sales). To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost, use recent-3 demand to capture the current lower regime (more responsive than full-sample mean). Keep L as default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock and cap around the most recent regime and reduces overstock risk given equal profit and holding cost.

Recent demand has fallen compared with earlier peaks: last 3 demands (Periods 28-30) = [158,140,145], indicating a lower recent mean. I set L=default to trust the promised lead time (supported by consistent arrived messages). I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to focus the base-stock on the most recent lower-demand regime and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability; this reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given zero pipeline and zero on-hand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Demand has trimmed down from mid-year peaks; recent 3-week demand (Periods 29-31: 140,145,141) shows a lower, stable regime (~142 mean) versus earlier high variance. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0) because concluded history consistently shows 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current lower demand regime and avoid overstock. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent reduced volatility; this tightens safety stock and reduces holding cost given profit=holding cost. This balances service vs holding by forecasting (1+L)*recent mean and a recent volatility estimate so orders won\u2019t inflate inventory.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=45, in-transit=0, no outstanding arrivals. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been low: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 33-35) = [147,106,85], indicating a lower recent mean; to avoid excess holding given profit=holding ($1/$1) (critical service quantile q=0.5), use a short recent window. Set L=default to keep promised lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the current low-demand regime and reduce target base stock and safety stock accordingly.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized vs earlier high plateau: last 11 demand observations (Periods 26-36) show lower average than full-sample. On-hand=29, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero; avoid large holdings given holding cost = profit. Use promised lead time (observed lead times have been 0). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=11 to reflect the sustained lower regime (captures periods 26\u201336) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last11). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders down relative to full-sample, reducing holding cost while matching the current lower demand regime and the zero pipeline.

Recent demand (Periods 35-37 = 85,84,109) remains at a lower regime vs earlier peaks, so I use a short recent window to capture the current lower mean and volatility. Set L to default (promised 0).

Promised lead time historically = 0 with no lost shipments; use default lead time. Forecast demand using recent observations to reflect the lower regime: use recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 (captures last 4 demand points). Use default sigma_hat (full-sample scaling) so the OR backend retains a conservative uncertainty estimate. These choices align the base-stock to recent lower demand while keeping uncertainty modest given no observed shipment issues.

Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical actual lead time has been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has trended down (last 3 demands: 109, 78, 61) after the earlier regime shifts. No new sustained changepoint detected. To keep the OR backend responsive to the recent lower demand while preserving service, set L=default (use promised 0), use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand level across the review+lead period, and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen and a new lower regime appears from Period 35 onward (6 periods: 85,84,109,78,61,69). Promised lead time historically observed as 0 throughout history, so use default L. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (N=6) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to recent demand and reduces excess holding given profit=holding. This keeps service reasonable while lowering holding cost risk given no pipeline inventory and short promised lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: recent-6 mean=81.0 (Periods 35-40: 85,84,109,78,61,69) vs prior recent-5 mean=134.8 (Periods 30-34: 145,141,135,147,106), a -40% drop, sustained 6 periods

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 35 (recent 6 weeks avg ~81). On-hand=14, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed (historical concludes show lead_time=0). To avoid excess holding while maintaining service in this sustained low-demand regime, set lead time to promised (default=0) and base demand estimates using the most recent 6 periods to reflect the confirmed low mean/variance. Methods chosen: L=default (use promised 0), mu_hat=recent_N (N=6) to scale (1+L)*recent mean, sigma_hat=recent_N (N=6) to capture recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock to match the new lower-demand regime and limits holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show orders consistently arriving same period (lead_time=0 observed many times), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been in a lower regime: last 6 actual demands (Periods 37-42) = 109,78,61,69,67,109? (using concluded demands shows sustained lower demand around ~81 units); to avoid excess holding I base forecasts on the recent 6-period regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the lower mean and recent volatility; this reduces target base stock and holding cost while preserving service for current regime.

On-hand=22, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default (use promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and to keep orders conservative given equal profit and holding cost ($1 each).

Recent demand has been in a lower regime vs earlier year (recent weeks ~55\u2013109, sustained lower demand detected previously around Period 35\u201340). No evidence of delayed or lost shipments (all concluded lead times = 0 historically). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime and keep inventory lean vs equal profit/holding cost, use recent demand estimates over the last 6 periods to set mu_hat and sigma_hat; keep L as default (promised=0). This biases orders to match the current low-volatility, lower-mean regime and avoids excess holding cost.

Set mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the current low regime; set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect reduced volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Promised and observed lead time have been consistently 0 in concluded history; no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Recent demand shows elevated variability around late Nov\u2013Dec with a spike in Period 46 (92) after several mid-range weeks (61,55,64, etc.). To react to recent regime (holiday-season volatility) I use recent_N=6 to let the backend compute (1+L)*mean over the most recent 6 samples, capturing short-term level and variability while avoiding overreacting to a single spike. L left at default (promised=0). No new sustained changepoint confirmed that wasn't already recorded.
