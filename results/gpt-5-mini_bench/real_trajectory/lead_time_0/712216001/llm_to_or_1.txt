Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 712216001 on-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean=85.6, std\u224820.5. Use promised lead time (default) because no evidence of delays; use default demand/statistics so backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (use historical mean) vs holding cost given no observed regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent concluded history shows the Period 1 order (120) arrived in-period (arrived=120, lead_time=0). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~85.6. No sustained demand regime shift detected. Use promised/default lead time (L=0) confirmed by the concluded arrival. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit $19 vs holding $1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order placed P1 arrived P1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $2003.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Concluded history shows two confirmed same-period arrivals (orders placed in P1 and P2 arrived in P1 and P2) so actual lead time is 0. On-hand=11, in-transit=0, recent demands (91,106) are elevated versus older samples but sample size is small. To keep estimates robust and let the OR engine blend long-run and recent data, I use calculated lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (high profit $19) against holding cost $1 by leveraging the engine's base-stock formula and capped order size.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded demands: P1=91, P2=106, P3=91; on-hand=29, in-transit=0. Carry-over shows lead time observed=0. To respond to elevated recent weekly demand (~96 avg) and zero lead time, set L to calculated average observed (0). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (samples: 91,106,91). This supplies the OR engine with a (1+L)-period demand mean and recent volatility to balance service level versus holding cost given low on-hand and fast replenishment.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand (P1-P4: 91,106,91,104) averages ~98, up from historical sample mean ~85.6 \u2192 recent upward regime. On-hand=7, in-transit=0 so low coverage vs expected demand. No overdue arrivals visible. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0 in prior concludes). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (N chosen = 4 recent periods of consistent elevated demand). These choices raise target base-stock to improve service while sigma_hat reflects recent variability to avoid overstock.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Recent observed weekly demand (Periods 1-5) = [91,106,91,104,93], mean\u224897.0, showing demand materially above the legacy seed samples. Multiple concluded periods confirm lead time = 0, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the current higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility from the last 5 realized demands; this increases target base-stock to preserve service while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend formula.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1-6) are all 0 \u2192 confirm L=0. Recent demand: periods show variability but no sustained (3+ period) regime shift (demands: 91,106,91,104,93,49). Therefore use calculated lead time from observations and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend uses full sample mean/variance; this balances service level with low holding cost given confirmed zero lead time and no clear demand structural change.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent observed lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed in history). Recent demand has softened from earlier high 90\u2013106 levels to lower values in the last 5 periods (P3\u2013P7 demands = 91,104,93,49,62; mean \u2248 79.8). On-hand = 58, in-transit = 0; with lead time 0 replenishment can arrive same period, so use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the recent downshift and avoid excess holding cost. Chosen L uses the promised/default (0). mu_hat uses recent_N=5 to capture current regime (1+L multiplier applied by backend). sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility including the drop in P6\u2013P7.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P8) show every order arrived in same period => confirmed lead time 0. Recent demand varies (range 49\u2013114) but no sustained regime shift (only one low week P6). I choose to set L by calculating observed lead times (will be 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical data and the confirmed L=0 to balance service level (via profit/(profit+holding) quantile) against holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent observed lead times from Periods 1-9 are all 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Demand history (Periods 1-9 demand = [91,106,91,104,93,49,62,114,85]) shows no sustained structural break but notable recent volatility; on-hand=37, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. I choose recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent 9 weeks (captures latest mean and volatility) while keeping L as default (0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. These parameters balance service (use recent demand mean) vs. holding cost (use recent volatility to avoid overshoot given holding cost=$1/unit).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show all observed lead_times=0 (Periods 1\u201310), so keep L as promised (0). Recent demand (Periods 6\u201310 = 49,62,114,85,99) reflects current regime; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent mean demand (~81.8 units) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This balances service (meet ~recent mean demand) against holding cost given current low pipeline.

Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data (Periods 1\u201311) consistently show actual lead time = 0. No overdue/lost shipments. I therefore set L to default (promised 0). Demand forecast and uncertainty use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrival (lead time 0) across many periods, so use promised/default L=0. Demand sample set available is small but stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock tied to long-run sample mean/volatility and avoids overreacting to short-term fluctuations while respecting zero lead time; with profit $19 and holding $1, backend will set service-level via q=profit/(profit+holding).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment (lead time observed = 0 in many periods), on-hand=71, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has averaged ~86 (historical samples ~85.6) with moderate variability. No sustained regime change detected. I therefore accept promised lead time (L=0) and use default demand and volatility estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std, which balances service level given profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

Demand history shows weekly variability but no sustained recent regime shift. Use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand moments so OR backend applies full-sample mean/std scaling ((1+L) factor) to compute base-stock.

Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every observed order had lead time 0 (Period 1\u201318 all arrived same period), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand history shows no sustained upward regime shift; recent weeks demand moderate and variable. To keep policy simple and let OR engine use full-sample statistics, use default lead time (promised = 0) and default demand mean/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service (use full historical mean) versus holding cost given holding cost is low relative to profit.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (many concluded orders with lead_time=0) and a large demand spike in Period 19 that caused a stockout. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + next period demand. Given strong, consistent evidence that actual lead time = promised 0 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0) and no clear sustained change in demand regime (the Period 19 spike is single-period extreme), use default methods so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This balances service level (captures long-run mean and variance) while avoiding overreacting to one large spike.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed P1..P20 arrivals same-period). Recent demand shows a sustained upward shift in the last 3 periods (P18=72, P19=154, P20=254) versus prior weeks (mostly 40\u2013120). To capture the new high-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stocking for the elevated demand while keeping volatility estimated from the same recent window.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=144, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (three high-demand weeks: 154, 254, 166). Promised lead time is 0 and confirmed historically (Period 1 & many concludes). To react to the new higher demand I set L to default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the elevated mean/volatility from Periods 19-21 so the OR backend raises target base-stock and safety stock. This addresses the risk of stockouts given no in-transit inventory while limiting excess holding by focusing on the recent regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15): recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (weeks 19-21 avg ~191 vs prior ~79). On-hand=173, in-transit=0 so we must plan for elevated demand this period. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0; use default L. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 19-21). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect short-term volatility in the new regime. These choices bias base-stock up to meet higher service needs while keeping variance estimate tied to the recent spike.

Demand regime shift beginning Period 19 (Periods 19-23 mean \u2248191.3 vs prior mean \u224879) \u2014 recent higher demand persists for 5 periods. I keep L=default (promised 0) since concluded history confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher regime (Periods 19-23) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the elevated mean and uncertainty; this reduces stockouts while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1 and profit $19.

Demand regime shifted up starting Period 19 (Periods 19-24 show much higher weekly demand vs Periods 1-18); to capture the new regime, use recent_N=6 (Periods 19-24) for demand mean and volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher demand while limiting excess safety stock since L=0 and holding cost is low relative to profit.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=137, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show stable lead time = 0 (consistent P1-P25). Demand regime increased starting Period 19 (Periods 1-18 avg=79, Periods 19-25 avg\u2248191). No overdue/lost shipments. I set L=default to trust confirmed 0-period lead time. To capture the higher recent demand I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, using N=7 (Periods 19-25) because the regime change began at Period 19 and the recent regime length is 7 \u2014 N = max(min(regime_length,20),3)=7. This biases the OR backend forecast to the new higher demand while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed arrivals and avoiding overstock from older low-demand samples.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (avg jumped ~79 \u2192 ~191). On-hand=158, in-transit=0; promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals confirm 0. To capture the higher recent demand I set L=default (promised=0) and use recent_N for demand parameters focusing on the post-changepoint regime. I choose N=8 (Periods 19\u201326) because the regime length is 8; this biases mu_hat and sigma_hat to the new, higher mean/volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock and reduces stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=181, in-transit=0. Historic concluded lead times consistently 0 (multiple periods), and a sustained demand regime shift began at Period 19 (demands higher since P19). I set L to default (promised 0) since concluded data confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 19\u201327) to capture the post-shift higher mean when computing (1+L)*mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders to satisfy the elevated demand while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent sustained demand regime established starting Period 19 (avg rose ~142%); historical concluded lead times all 0. On-hand=176, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Choose L=default to trust promised 0-period lead time (validated by all conclude messages). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 19-28) to capture the new higher-demand regime; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters focus the base-stock on the post-shift demand level to avoid stockouts while avoiding excessive holding given $1 holding cost vs $19 profit.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Recent demand (Periods 22-29) has fallen back from the spike around Periods 19-21; last 9 observed weekly demands (P21-P29) show a lower recent mean. On-hand = 176, in-transit = 0, so inventory is ample vs recent demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the current lower-demand regime (focus on most recent 9 weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service appropriate to the current run-rate and avoids excess holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=144, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised/default lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 19 (higher mean). Use recent demand from the post-changepoint regime to set forecast: choose recent_N with N=12 (Periods 19\u201330) to capture the new elevated mean and volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher demand while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes given current healthy on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=195, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P31 arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 19 (higher mean); to capture the post-change demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the regime since Period 19 (13 periods: P19\u2013P31). No overdue shipments detected. This raises forecast and safety stock to reflect the higher recent mean while keeping L at promised to avoid unnecessary pipeline inflation.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has fallen from the mid-summer spike to much lower weekly sales (last 5 demands: 59,54,38,26,20; mean \u224839). On-hand=198, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for one-week demand. No new lead-time evidence (lead time has been consistently 0). I set L=default to keep promised 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the clear recent low-demand regime and avoids overweighting the mid-summer spike. I also set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture current low volatility. These choices keep the base-stock low to reduce holding cost while meeting near-term demand.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent history: confirmed lead time = 0 (Period 1 concl.) and sustained higher-demand regime since Period 19 (avg ~191 over P19-21 vs ~79 prior). Current on-hand=144, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To reflect the new, higher demand regime I use recent_N sampling over the post-change regime (Periods 19\u201333, length 15) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the most relevant data. Keeping L=default (promised 0) is appropriate because arrivals have consistently concluded with 0 lead time. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat tightens the base-stock to the elevated demand while relying on observed short-term variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand, keep promised lead time (default) and base forecasts on the most recent 6 weeks to reflect current lower demand and recent volatility. Use recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine reduces ordering toward current demand while still accounting for short-term variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=149, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen from the mid-year spike (Periods 19-25) to lower weekly sales in Sep\u2013Oct (last 5 demands: 22,11,11,16,54 \u2014 mixed but recent tail shows lower demand). No confirmed lost shipments; historical lead time confirmed as 0. To be responsive to recent lower demand while preserving service, use promised lead time (default), compute mu_hat from the recent 5 weeks to capture the current regime, and keep sigma_hat as default to reflect full-sample volatility for safety against occasional spikes.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/04 (Period 39). On-hand=129, in-transit=0. Historical conclues confirm lead time = 0 (early periods) and recent demand has settled to a low-autumn regime (Periods 30-38 mostly small weekly sales). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 30-38) so the OR backend orders conservatively and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=121, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. Demand shows a sustained drop starting at Period 30 (recent 10 periods much lower than earlier). To avoid overstock while protecting service, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent 10-week regime to capture the lower mean and volatility. This reduces mu_hat and sigma_hat vs. older high-demand periods and prevents excessive ordering given current high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand fell from 104.6 (Periods 21-29) to 22.6 (Periods 30-39), a decrease of ~78%.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 30 (carry-over: avg fell to ~22.6). On-hand=116, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock versus current low demand. Lead time historically confirmed 0. To avoid excess replenishment given the persistent low regime, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand estimates focused on the low-demand regime: N=11 (Periods 30\u201340) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of this recent regime and sigma_hat reflects its recent volatility. This reduces order quantities vs. using full-history averages and balances high profit-driven service level with strong holding-cost risk from overstock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=106, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 30 (Periods 30-41 avg \u2248 18; markedly lower than earlier regime). Lead time previously confirmed as 0. To avoid overstock while meeting near-term demand, keep L as promised (default = 0). Forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=12 (covering Periods 30-41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the current low-demand regime.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 30 (avg ~22.6 over P30-39). Recent ten+ periods (P30-42, length=13) remain low with a single spike (P42=41) that is not yet sustained. On-hand=65, in-transit=0. I set L=default to use promised/confirmed 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (covering the post-changepoint low-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of last 13 samples; sigma_hat recent_N N=13 to capture volatility in this regime. This reduces overstocking vs. using the earlier high-demand regime and balances service level vs. holding cost given low current demand and high holding penalty relative to demand uncertainty.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been low following the fall regime shift (Periods 30-39 avg ~22.6; Periods 39-43 demands = 8,5,10,41,28). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost while covering immediate low demand, I use L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N=5 to capture the most recent low-demand regime (mean of last 5 weeks \u224818.4) and reduce ordering to match current cadence. For volatility I also use recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand variability rather than historical high-variance periods. These parameters bias the OR engine toward a low base stock and lower cap, limiting replenishment and holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0; recent demand regime dropped around Period 30 and has stayed lower. I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the lower recent mean/variance: N=15 (Periods 30-44) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current low-demand regime, reducing overstock while preserving service. This balances high profit (q\u22480.95) with much lower recent demand and current on-hand stock to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0 (confirmed Period 2); no evidence of lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 37-45 = 16,20,8,5,10,41,28,3,56) shows low baseline with a recent spike (56) \u2014 no sustained new regime yet. To be responsive to recent variability while keeping calculations anchored to the current short lead time, I use promised lead time (default=0) and base demand estimates on the most recent observations (recent_N with N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine emphasizes current demand pattern and variance.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show lead time reliably 0 (many confirms) and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 30 (avg ~22.6 through Period 39 and low volumes thereafter). To avoid large excess inventory given low recent demand, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the low-demand regime; choose N=17 (Periods 30\u201346 inclusive = 17 samples) to capture the sustained lower mean/variance while respecting the recent-regime length and the N selection rules. This reduces target base stock and holding cost exposure while preserving service for the current low-demand environment.
