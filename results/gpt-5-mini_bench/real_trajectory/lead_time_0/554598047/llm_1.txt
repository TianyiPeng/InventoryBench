Recent 3-week average (2019-01-21..2019-02-04)=19.3 units/week; last two weeks average=24.5, indicating rising demand. c) Lead time / orders: Supplier promised LT=0 but no concluded arrivals seen yet; actual lead time unknown. Treat promised LT=0 as working assumption but remain cautious. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no coverage for current period. e) Order logic: Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) vs profit $19/unit, so favor higher service level to capture profit. Forecast for current period ~25 units (rounded from recent average and trend). To cover uncertainty in lead time and upward trend, place an order of 30 units to reduce stockout risk while keeping holding cost modest.",
