Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [73,48,65,94,49], mean=65.8, no arrivals or in-transit stock and no concluded lead-time evidence. No sustained changepoint or delayed shipments observed. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on full history, balancing service level vs holding cost given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent realized demand: Period1 sold=63. Historical samples (weeks in Jan\u2013Feb) mean\u224865.8, std\u224819.0. On-hand=3, in-transit=0; last period an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 with lead_time=0 (evidence that actual lead time is at least 0 and matches promised). No signs of lost shipments or regime shift yet. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to confirm actual lead time from data (calculate). For demand I use the full-sample default ((1+L)\xd7mean) because no sustained changepoint detected; dispersion likewise uses default. This balances service (base stock near historical mean) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 both arrived in same period (arrived=66 from P1, arrived=63 from P2) -> actual lead time observed = 0 periods (consistent with promised). Recent realized demand was 63 then 88 (two periods), which hints at a possible uptick but is not yet a sustained changepoint. To remain robust and let the OR engine combine all historical samples, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so base_stock is computed from full-sample mean and std. This balances service level given limited evidence of a regime shift while avoiding excess holding cost when on-hand=0 and no in-transit stock.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive orders arriving same period (lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history (seed samples) mean ~65.8. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual lead time=0. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples; this balances service (using full historical mean) with holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1; P2 order arrived P2; P3 order arrived P3)

Daily Reward (R_t): $71.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent realized demands (Periods 1-4) = [63,88,84,76], on-hand=0, in-transit=0; historical early samples also available. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 (orders P1\u2013P4 arrived same period). I use L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because arrivals confirmed. Demand appears elevated vs earlier baseline; to capture the recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (uses the four most recent demand observations) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean_recent and volatility from recent data. This raises the target base-stock to reduce stockouts given zero observed lead time while avoiding excessive holding by limiting N to the most recent stable regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean (five weeks) ~65.8 units/week; recent periods show sustained weekly demand ~76\u201385 with stockouts after arrivals. Lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded periods. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=holding, use baseline forecasts from the full-sample stats and promised lead time=0 so OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and corresponding std; this keeps target stock near historical average while avoiding excess holding.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P6) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed 0 each concluded period) and persistent stockouts (on-hand=0 each period end except P1 small carry). Demand has been strong and stable around the observed weekly samples. I therefore use the default lead time (promised 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals). I also use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine balance service level vs holding cost with its calibrated z*-cap logic. No overdue or lost shipments to adjust for; on-hand and in-transit are zero so the backend will order up to the computed base stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1\u2192P1, P2\u2192P2, P3\u2192P3, P4\u2192P4, P5\u2192P5, P6\u2192P6)

Daily Reward (R_t): $34.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Recent realized lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u20137 conclude). Demand recent history (Periods 1\u20137) shows variability with a lower last-week demand (54) but overall moderate weekly demand; to capture the most relevant recent regime I use the last 7 periods for forecasting. L uses default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with observed arrivals. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=7) to reflect the current demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend will size base-stock to balance service and holding cost under the confirmed zero lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent observed demand (Periods 4-8) increased vs earlier baseline with volatile weekly sales (recent demands: 76,85,82,54,94). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need a replenishment target reflecting the recent regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (Periods 1-8), so use promised lead time. I therefore set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use a recent_N window of the last 5 weeks to capture the current higher mean (N=5) for mu_hat and the same window for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward recent realized demand and avoid understocking given no pipeline and confirmed zero lead time; using recent sigma preserves service-level sizing while limiting extra holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $35.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time 0 (multiple confirmations through Period 9). Recent demand has been variable but lower than earlier peaks; last 5 realized demands (Periods 5-9) average \u224874.4 units with elevated volatility. I therefore use promised/default lead time (0) and base the demand forecast on the most recent 5 periods to capture the current regime (N=5) for both mean and volatility so the OR engine targets a service level reflecting recent lower demand while accounting for observed variability. This balances stockouts (profit $1) against holding cost ($1) given limited on-hand inventory and no in-transit stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed across multiple periods). Demand in the most recent 5 concluded periods (P7\u2013P11) = [54,94,57,51,63], recent mean \u224863.8. To match current fast replenishment reality and recent demand regime, I set L to default (promised 0), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to target (1+L)*recent mean, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent weekly demand) against holding cost by using recent-demand estimates rather than long-ago samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 repeatedly), no lost shipments. Demand history shows no sustained regime change; I'll use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats so the OR backend computes base-stock from all available data, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Recent 14-period demand history shows no abrupt regime shift but significant variability; to reflect current demand profile I use a recent-window forecast (last 10 periods) for both mean and volatility so the OR backend adapts to the most recent demand while keeping L=0 to match observed arrivals. This balances service (capture recent demand level) against holding cost by avoiding reliance on older samples.

Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed across many periods) and demand appears stable around prior sample mean.

No evidence of sustained demand regime shift; recent demand fluctuates but centers around prior historical mean. To balance service level vs holding cost I use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine computes base-stock from all samples and current promised L=0. This keeps ordering responsive while avoiding extra holding given holding cost equals profit.

No evidence of lost shipments or a sustained demand regime shift (recent demands vary but center around ~60\u201375). To keep the OR backend conservative and aligned with observed operations, use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This leverages the full sample set, maintains service while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding cost.

On-hand=32, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Profit and holding cost equal ($1/$1) \u2192 critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0) so base_stock = mu_hat; using full-sample statistics provides stable forecast given no detected demand regime shift. I therefore use default lead time and default demand statistics (all samples) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost under symmetric cost structure and current stable demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent weekly demand has settled lower (summer): last 5 demands P20\u2013P24 = [30,39,50,33,37], mean \u2248 37.8. On-hand=27, in-transit=0 and historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 0, so use promised/default lead time. To keep inventory aligned with the current low-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 5 weeks (captures the recent mean \xd7 (1+L)). Volatility has also tightened recently, so sigma_hat uses recent_N with the same 5 samples. This reduces overstock and holding cost while preserving service for the observed demand level.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Observed history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 in concluded periods and on-hand=5, in-transit=0. No sustained demand regime shift detected vs. historical samples. Use promised/default lead time to match confirmed 0-period arrivals. Use default demand scaling (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to let OR engine apply its base-stock formula using full-sample stats; use default volatility so backend uses full-sample std. This balances service level (captures historical mean ~65.8 units/week) against holding cost given holding=profit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0; no overdue shipments. Recent weeks (Periods 22-26 demands = 50,33,37,33,44; mean\u224839.4) show a lower summer demand regime vs earlier months. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-mean, lower-volatility summer regime so the OR backend reduces ordering and holding costs while preserving service.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed previously), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has trended lower than early-year samples; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 23-27) = [33,37,33,44,68], suggesting a lower short-term mean and similar short-term volatility. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus the base-stock on the latest regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent variability. This keeps service targeted to current demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost = profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over). Demand has been lower recently vs earlier season; I use recent demand to adapt forecast. Set L=default to trust promised/observed 0-pt lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 (last 5 weeks: periods 24-28) so the base-stock reflects the current lower demand level and recent volatility, balancing service (profit=holding so q\u22480.5) against holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. On-hand=1, in-transit=0; recent history (Periods 1\u201329) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and variable weekly demand (no recent sustained regime shift). Given profit=holding, critical service tradeoff is neutral (q=0.5) so use population estimates. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances fill rate vs holding cost while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise. This also accounts for the absence of in-transit inventory and the very low on-hand level.

Historical concluded data shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed across many periods) and weekly demand variability without a recent sustained regime shift.

No clear recent sustained demand regime shift; use full-sample defaults so backend uses all observed demand statistics to compute base-stock and cap.

No overdue shipments. Set L to default (promised 0) because multiple concluded periods confirm 0 lead time. For demand I focus on the most recent regime (Period 30-32) using recent_N with N=3 to capture the elevated mean; apply recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat as well to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while relying on confirmed zero lead time to avoid extra pipeline buffer.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-day arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed). Recent demand has stepped up in late Aug\u2013Sep (Periods 30-33 demands = 95,101,65,114). To react quickly to the recent higher and more variable demand I use a recent window for demand estimates (last 4 weeks) while keeping promised lead time. This increases the base-stock to cover the current elevated demand while the OR backend caps orders; sigma from recent 4 weeks captures heightened variability and raises safety stock appropriately. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change beyond already recorded confirmations.

Recent demand has spikes (Sept weeks) but no sustained regime change detected that warrants overriding defaults. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed 0 lead time and full historical demand samples, use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the backend computes base_stock from the full-sample mean and std.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 \u2014 expect same. No overdue or lost shipments visible. Demand history shows variable weekly demand; using defaults lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples so base-stock reflects long-run average while keeping policy simple given stable confirmed lead time. This balances service (profit=holding cost) by letting backend set the target safety stock via its q ratio.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 periods. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P35\u2013P39 demands = 73,51,68,57,57) averages ~61.2; recent variance modest (std ~8). Use promised/default lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period service. Set mu_hat based on recent 5-week mean to capture the latest demand regime (avoiding older seasonal noise). Set sigma_hat based on recent 5-week variability to size safety stock appropriately given low holding/profit tradeoff.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over notes). No sustained demand regime shift detected recently that isn't already recorded. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed behavior and the promised lead time, use default lead time and default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)). This provides a stable base-stock target while avoiding overfitting to short recent swings given limited new evidence.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed in prior periods). No sustained demand regime shift detected beyond normal variability. To let the OR engine use full-sample demand statistics and the promised lead time, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0; recent demand shows a large spike in Period 42 (129) but overall sample mean remains the primary signal. No overdue shipments. Use promised lead time and population moments so OR backend sets base-stock reflecting long-run mean/variance while reacting to recent spike via its z* safety-stock formula.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (period 44). Recent weekly demand shows a one-time spike at Period 42 (129) but otherwise weekly demand in the last 5 periods averages ~72 units; lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding => q=0.5), I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the current seasonality without overreacting to the single large spike. Using N=5 captures the immediate recent regime while keeping variance estimation aligned to recent variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time consistently 0; recent history shows regular weekly demand variability and occasional spikes (e.g., Period 42 demand=129). Given immediate arrivals (L=0) and balanced profit vs holding cost ($1/$1), use defaults so backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean and std, allowing the OR engine to target the profit-driven service level while capping order size.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0; recent demand history shows variable weekly demand with no clear sustained regime shift. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because multiple concluded periods confirm same-day arrivals. I choose mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) to compute base-stock and cap; this balances service level and holding cost given stable lead time and no recent demand regime change. This also keeps orders small given modest on-hand inventory and equal profit/holding cost.

Demand shows regular weekly variability with occasional spikes (e.g., Period 42 demand=129) but no sustained regime change in last 3+ periods. To keep the OR backend calibrated to observed fast replenishment and stable demand, set L to default (promised 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).
