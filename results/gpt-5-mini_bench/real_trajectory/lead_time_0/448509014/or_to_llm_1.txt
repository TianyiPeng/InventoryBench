OR recommendation = 149 (uses historical data and promised lead time). With L=0 we must cover only the upcoming period's demand; expected single-period demand \u2248128 < on-hand 141, so no replenishment is required to meet expected demand.

OR recommends 203 using longer historical averages and promised L=0; that would raise inventory and incur holding cost $1/unit/period.
