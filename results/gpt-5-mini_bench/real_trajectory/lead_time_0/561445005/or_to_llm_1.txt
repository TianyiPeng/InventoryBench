Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 (orders historically arrive same period). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so any order placed now will arrive during Period 47 and can satisfy Period 47 demand. Demand analysis: recent realized weekly demands (Periods 43\u201346) = {12, 7, 19, 24} \u2192 recent mean \u224815.5; last several months show a sustained lower-demand regime vs earlier year. OR recommendation (111) is much higher than recent realized demand because it uses older history and the promised lead time assumption; with lead time = 0 we do not need pipeline cover for multiple periods. Cost tradeoff: profit = holding cost = $1 so expected net per unit equals expected sell probability; best to target expected demand to avoid carrying excess inventory. Decision: order modestly above recent mean to reduce small stockout risk from week-to-week variance. I choose 20 units (covers recent mean \u224815.5 with a small buffer).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Actual lead time = 0 and recent demand (Periods 43\u201346) averages ~15.5/week, so I reduced OR's 111 to 20 units to match current low-demand regime while leaving a small buffer.",
