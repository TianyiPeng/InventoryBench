{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-02-11 (week of Feb 11) \u2014 near Valentine's Day (2/14) which can modestly support womens T-shirt demand. Historical weekly demand (Jan\u2013Feb samples) averages \u2248134 units/week (113,141,104,173,134) with moderate variability. Lead time: supplier promised 0 but no concluded arrivals yet; actual lead time unknown. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision logic: because lead time is unconfirmed and arrivals will only be observed after orders conclude, place an order to cover one expected week of demand (L+1 coverage with conservative assumption L\u22650) while avoiding excess inventory since holding cost ($1/unit/period) equals profit ($1/unit) so overstock is costly. Recommended order roughly equals recent weekly average demand (~134).",
