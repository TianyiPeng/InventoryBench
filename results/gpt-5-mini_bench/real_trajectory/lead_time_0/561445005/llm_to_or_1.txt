Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (Jan-Feb) show mean ~133 units/week with no sustained regime shift (samples: 113,141,104,173,134). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment coverage for current period. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations exist yet, and no evidence of lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and demand estimates based on full-sample mean/variance to avoid overfitting to limited data. These parameters provide the OR backend a neutral base-stock target balancing service (profit=holding so q=0.5) versus holding cost given limited history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent sell-through: Period1 sold 133 of the 133 units that arrived (demand>arrival). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must restock to cover upcoming demand. Observed lead time from concluded history = 0 (Period1 order arrived in Period1). I choose L='calculate' so backend uses average observed lead times (captures confirmed 0). For demand forecast I choose mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using all historical weekly samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and limited recent data.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed P1,P2 arrived same period). Demand has stepped up vs. earlier 5-sample mean (recent sales: P1=156, P2=207; prior samples average ~133). I choose L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 (last 3 weeks capture the upward shift: 173,156,207) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Volatility also from recent_N N=3 to reflect current variability. These settings keep service high for elevated recent demand while avoiding overstating uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $166.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders arriving with lead_time=0 in Periods 1-3. Historical Jan samples had mean~133 but the last 3 concluded demand observations (P1-3: 156, 207, 179) average 180, indicating a sustained upward shift. I set L via 'calculate' to use observed lead times (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime; mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands). For volatility I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability. These choices raise target base-stock to meet the higher recent demand while keeping safety stock responsive to recent volatility; using recent_N avoids diluting the signal with older, lower-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: recent average (Periods 1-3) = 180 vs prior sample mean = 133 (+35%); sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $181.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent demand has shifted upward and sustained (recent 3-period avg ~185 vs prior sample mean 133). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to cover elevated demand. Lead time observed historically 0 in concluded periods -> use calculate to let backend set L=0. For demand, use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the sustained increase while limiting excess holding given holding cost = profit. This balances service level vs holding cost under the confirmed regime shift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent demand elevated vs historical: last 5 period demands = [156,207,179,187,159] \u2192 avg \u2248 177 (vs prior sample mean \u2248133). On-hand=32, in-transit=0 and all concluded lead times = 0 (orders from P1\u2013P5 arrived same period) so use promised lead time. To capture the recent sustained higher-demand regime (confirmed at Period 4) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std on the recent regime. L kept as default (promised 0) because concluded lead times remain 0. This raises target base-stock to improve service given demand lift while sigma_hat recent_N preserves appropriate safety stock to balance equal profit and holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has shifted up (recent weekly demands P1-P6 = [156,207,179,187,159,169], avg ~176). On-hand=9, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low vs recent demand. Observed arrivals in concluded periods show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period historically). Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 samples). Use default sigma_hat to let backend compute volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices target service (higher mu_hat) while relying on backend's sigma to balance holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has shifted up vs original historical samples: periods 1-7 demand average \u2248173 (sustained higher demand). On-hand=13, in-transit=0, so no incoming cover. Promised lead time observed historically as 0 (orders from P1\u2013P7 concluded with lead_time=0). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher regime, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 (use the last 7 demand samples to forecast (1+L)-period demand). For volatility, use sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to reflect recent variability rather than older lower-variance data. These choices raise the backend base-stock to protect service level under the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping lead time assumption aligned with observed concludes.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand has increased vs original samples: Periods 4-8 average \u2248 173 vs original mean \u2248133 (+30%). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0. I choose L by calculating average observed lead time (will be 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 4-8). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so variability reflects the recent regime. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service during the confirmed higher-demand period while keeping volatility estimates tied to recent data to avoid overstocking.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: recent average (Periods 1-3) = 180 vs prior sample mean = 133 (+35%); sustained for 3 periods.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20139 show lead_time=0 consistently, so set L via calculate (confirmed same-period arrival). With L=0, use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of historical samples) and default sigma to let the OR backend compute base-stock balancing $1 profit vs $1 holding cost. This keeps service while avoiding excess holding given moderate on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

All observed lead times have concluded as 0 periods, so use promised lead time. Set L=default to reflect confirmed 0-period arrivals. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the recent higher/volatile regime (captures the +35% regime shift previously recorded and rapid recent swings). This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while avoiding excessive holding given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has increased vs prior sample: last 3 concluded demands (Periods 9-11) = [114,219,267], recent mean = 200 (regime of 3 periods). Promised lead time has consistently been observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean) and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect increased short-term volatility. These settings push the OR engine toward a higher base stock to reduce stockouts while using a recent volatility estimate to limit overstock.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent observed lead times from concluded periods are consistently 0, so use default promised lead time. Demand has shown upward regime shifts earlier (Periods 1-3 vs prior and reaffirmed Periods 9); most recent demands (Periods 10-12 = 219, 267, 198) average \u2248228, noticeably above long-run mean, so use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the higher recent demand. Volatility should reflect recent variability, so use recent_N=3 for sigma_hat. On-hand=2, in-transit=0; parameters aim to raise target stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 9-13) = [114,219,267,198,197], recent mean = 199.0 units. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded messages show lead_time=0). To keep orders aligned with the most recent regime and avoid stockouts while not over-stocking (profit and holding cost equal), I use L=default (promised 0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 observed demands to capture the current elevated mean and recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has shifted higher and is sustained (see recorded carry-over); last 3 concluded demands = 198,197,222 (mean \u2248205.7) so use a recent_N forecast to capture the new regime. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility; this raises base-stock to meet higher demand while avoiding excessive holding given equal profit/holding ($1/$1).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/05/27 (Period 16). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (orders arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 11-15) is elevated vs earlier sample mean; using a recent_N forecast (N=5) captures the current higher-demand regime (avg \u2248216 units/week) to avoid stockouts while holding costs equal profit, so keep moderate safety via recent volatility estimate.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods (orders in previous periods arrived same period). Demand has been in a higher regime recently (recent weeks average ~208 vs prior ~133). To reflect the sustained higher demand and keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates from the most recent 5 samples to capture the current regime and recent volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, so use promised lead time (default). Demand has shown a sustained higher regime earlier; to react to recent variability while keeping responsiveness, I use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=3 (captures most recent 3 weeks' demand). These parameters give the OR engine a short, responsive forecast (1+L)*mean of last 3 and corresponding std to balance service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all past orders arrived same period), so use promised lead time (default). Recent realized demand has been elevated versus the very early-sample mean: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 14-18) = [222,198,225,154,146], mean \u2248189, indicating a sustained higher regime vs the original sample mean (~133). To adapt the forecast and keep service while avoiding excess holding, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N, N=5) so the backend scales the forecast and uncertainty to the current demand regime. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been higher than early-sample Jan mean; last 5 realized demands (Periods 15-19) average ~176 which reflects the sustained higher regime detected earlier. To target service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base_stock on the recent higher mean and volatility rather than the older low-Jan samples.

No recent sustained new demand or lead-time shifts beyond previously recorded carry-over insights. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics, choose default lead time and demand/volatility estimates so backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples)=133 and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1) (backend will compute z*).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0; no new lead-time evidence. Recent demands have varied but no new sustained regime change beyond earlier recorded insights. Profit and holding cost are equal, so avoid aggressive stocking. Use default lead time and demand statistics (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to keep targets conservative given current on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. Recent demand has been lower (~100s) vs earlier higher regime; on-hand=79, in-transit=0 so available inventory covers ~0.7 recent-week demand. Historical lead times consistently observed as 0 (orders concluded same period). I select L=default to trust promised lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 5 demand samples (captures current lower regime). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to estimate volatility from the same recent window. These choices tighten forecasts to recent lower demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has trended down from spring peaks; to adapt to recent lower demand while retaining some memory of prior higher weeks, I choose an EWMA forecast for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) which emphasizes recent weeks but smooths noise. Use default lead time (promised 0) and default sigma (uses full-sample volatility) so the OR backend's cap/stock calculations reflect observed overall variability. This balances service level (by adapting demand mean quickly) against holding cost (by shrinking target stock relative to older high-demand periods).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Recent demand has trended down (Periods 22-27 demands: 94,105,111,86,70,58) indicating a lower recent mean vs earlier periods. All concluded lead times = 0 historically, so use promised lead time. To avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent regime to reflect lower demand: use recent_N with N=6 (captures Periods 22-27). This reduces base_stock and cap, lowering holding risk while preserving service for current lower-demand regime.

Recent demand has softened vs the spring peak (Periods 24-28: 111,86,70,58,98) but not a clear sustained new high\u2014no new regime insight recorded. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, providing a stable base-stock that balances service (profit=$1) and holding (=$1) without overfitting recent noise when pipeline is empty.

Recent weekly demand has declined vs early-year (recent 3 demands: 58,98,63 -> mean \u224873), so I use a short recent window to reflect the current lower regime. Promised lead time history shows 0-period arrivals consistently, so keep L=default. Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=3) so the backend targets stocking roughly one-week demand (1+L)*mean_recent, avoiding excess holding given holding cost = profit. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect current lower volatility for tighter service-level sizing.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period (orders always arrived same period), so use promised lead time (default). Recent demand has been lower than earlier peaks; last 3 concluded demands = 98, 63, 51 (mean \u2248 70.7). I set mu_hat to recent_N=3 to reflect the current lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk. sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 to capture recent volatility. This keeps (1+L)\xd7mean small to avoid holding cost while preserving service for near-term demand; no evidence of new sustained regime or lead-time change to record.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent history shows consistently observed lead_time=0 in concluded messages and no overdue or lost arrivals; on-hand=33, in-transit=0. Demand has had prior confirmed regime shifts (recorded earlier) but no new sustained change in the last concluded periods (demands: 51, 38 most recent sold). Use promised lead time (default) because concluded history supports L=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given modest on-hand stock and symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1). This keeps ordering responsive to the full historical demand while avoiding overcommitment given zero in-transit units.

Lead times historically concluded as 0 periods consistently, so keep promised/default lead time. To avoid excess holding cost given low on-hand and weak recent demand, set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect consistent observed 0-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent lower-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent lower volatility.

On-hand=19, in-transit=0 so we should not inflate forecasts based on older high months. Use promised lead time (default). Set mu_hat using a recent_N window to capture the current lower-demand regime (N=5). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and avoid oversized safety stock.

Recent demand (Periods 30-36) is materially lower than earlier periods, so I downweight long-run mean and use recent 7-period demand for forecasting. Set L to promised (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the recent low-demand regime and reduce overstock risk given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand in Periods 30-36 = 39.7 vs prior sample mean \u2248133 (\u2248-70%), sustained for 7 periods (Periods 30-36).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Recent data since Period 30 show a sustained lower-demand regime (periods 30\u201337 demands mostly 28\u201351, avg much lower than earlier sample). On-hand=15, in-transit=0 so we should forecast using the new low-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the recent low-demand regime; choose N=8 (covering Periods 30\u201337) to capture the sustained drop while remaining above the minimum N=3. This reduces forecasted order quantities and holding cost while matching current demand levels to preserve profit given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 30 (Periods 30-36 avg \u224839.7; sustained 7 periods). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N demand estimates over the most recent 9 concluded weeks (Periods 30-38) and keep promised lead time = default. This reduces target base-stock to match lower demand while sigma is estimated from the same recent window to reflect reduced volatility and avoid costly overstock given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show actual lead time consistently 0. Demand regime shifted down around Period 30 and low demand (~40/week) has been sustained through recent periods (Periods 30-39). Given the sustained low-demand regime, use recent data to forecast. Set L to default (promised lead time=0). Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 (covering the sustained low-demand regime: Periods 30-39) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 10 samples. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces ordering to match the new lower demand and limits holding cost given low throughput and current on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods so use promised lead time (default). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since ~Period 30; recent 10 realized weekly demands (P31-40) average ~30.5 units. To reflect the current low-demand regime and limit holding cost while maintaining service, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 so the OR engine sizes base-stock to recent demand volatility and mean.

Demand has been in a low regime since Period 30 (Periods 30-36 avg \u224839.7, sustained); recent weeks remain low (P37-41 demands: 25,32,9,12,17). To avoid overstocking, keep promised lead time and forecast using the recent low-demand regime. Set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to capture the sustained low-demand period (Periods 30-41) for mean and volatility estimation, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each).

All observed lead times = 0 historically, so use promised lead time. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 13 samples (regime_length=13) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the current low-demand regime, reducing overstock risk while preserving service.

Recent history shows the sustained low-demand regime since Period 30 (Periods 30-43 = 14 weeks of lower demand), and observed lead times have consistently been 0. To match the current low-demand regime I set lead time to promised (default) and estimate demand and volatility from the recent regime using the last 14 periods so the OR backend targets a lower base-stock and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service.

To avoid overstocking I keep promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand forecast on the sustained low-demand regime. I use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the low-demand regime (Periods 30-44) so the backend sets a much lower base-stock and reduces orders/holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 30 (sustained low avg through Periods 30\u201345). On-hand=10, in-transit=0, so pipeline is zero and we should avoid sizable replenishment given holding cost equals profit. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) since all concluded lead-time observations are 0. For demand I use recent_N to anchor (1+L)*mean on the most recent low-demand regime to avoid overstock; N=16 covers Periods 30\u201345 (regime length=16) which is \u22653 and <20. I apply recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap order size to limit holding cost while meeting modest recent demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical actual lead times observed have been 0 consistently; use default promised lead time. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 30 (Periods 30-46 average \u224839.7, recent Dec weeks much lower: Periods 42-46 avg \u224820). To match recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the detected recent regime length (N=17, Periods 30-46) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility rather than the much larger long-run mean. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given low demand. L uses promised lead time to reflect observed 0-period arrivals.
