Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: confirmed actual lead time = 0 (carry-over insight from Period 4 and every concluded period shows arrived same period). Inventory & demand: on-hand = 159, in-transit = 0. Recent concluded demands (P41\u2013P46): 117,118,221,89,79,80,79 \u2192 recent weeks show variability with occasional spike (221 in P42) but last three weeks are ~89,80,79 (declining post-holiday). Promised LT=0 so orders would arrive same period but arrival is after decision \u2014 however with LT=0 we still observe immediate arrivals historically. OR recommends 77 based on historical mean and cap. Decision logic: with profit= $4 and holding cost=$1, critical fractile favors some safety stock, but current on-hand (159) already exceeds a single-period demand forecast and covers ~1\u20132 weeks of recent demand; ordering 77 would raise holding cost unnecessarily and risk overstock given softening demand at year-end (Period 47: 2019-12-30). No evidence of lost shipments or LT change beyond confirmed 0. Final action: do not order this period to avoid extra holding cost while meeting demand from existing stock.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 77\u21920: on-hand 159 with confirmed LT=0 already covers expected near-term demand and recent weeks show lower post-holiday sales, so avoid extra holding cost.",
