Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals observed. Historical weekly samples (Jan 7\u2013Feb 4) show mean demand = 90 units/week and high variance (std \u2248 70). Promised lead time is 0 and with no evidence of delays or regime change, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from full history. This balances service (covers one-week demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=120, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=156, lead_time=0), so no evidence of delays; use promised/default lead time. Historical weekly demand samples mean=90 (samples: 229,49,68,62,42); use default demand/volatility calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so backend computes mu_hat and sigma_hat consistent with observed history. This keeps policy anchored to long-run data while respecting observed on-time lead time and balancing service vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $132.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 both arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 twice), so actual lead time aligns with promised 0. Historical sample mean (2019 Jan weekly samples) is 90 units; recent realized weekly demand (36, 55) is lower but only two periods\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained regime change. I therefore keep L at default (promised), use default demand estimates based on all samples to avoid overreacting to limited recent noise, and keep sigma default to reflect historical volatility. This balances service level (using historical mean) against holding cost while we wait for more evidence of a demand shift or lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $105.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=87, in-transit=0. Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1-3 all arrived same period (observed lead times = 0,0,0), so I trust a 0-period lead time. I choose L by calculate to use observed lead times. For demand I use default (all-sample mean) and default sigma so the OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps policy anchored to the long-run sample history while acknowledging confirmed same-period replenishment; with on-hand=87 and no pipeline, this will let the OR engine decide replenishment to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3)

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent realized weekly demands (Periods 1-4) = [36,55,48,31]; on-hand=97, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods (Period 4 conclude shows Pn orders arriving same period). No evidence of lost shipments. To reflect the most recent regime (lower, variable weekly demand vs. older Jan samples), I use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 4 observed demands (N=4). For lead time I use default (promised lead time = 0). Using recent_N captures current mean (and variance) and keeps inventory responsive while the OR backend computes safety stock via its service-level formula.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent observed weekly demand (Periods 1\u20135 conclude) = [36,55,48,31,23], on-hand=74, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior conclude messages, so use promised lead time. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent regime (stable, lower demand after the large historical outlier in Jan 2019). This keeps the (1+L)-period demand forecast focused on recent weekly demand and the volatility estimate responsive to recent variability, while avoiding over-ordering given current on-hand inventory and holding cost (holding cost $1 vs profit $4 implies moderate service level).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent realized weekly demand has declined from earlier highs: last 6 concluded demands = [36,55,48,31,23,20], mean = 35.5 units/week. On-hand = 54, in-transit = 0. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 periods (carry-over). I set L to default (promised 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the clear downward shift in demand over the most recent 6 periods so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding cost. This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has declined from earlier peaks (36,55,48,31,23,20,21 across P1\u2013P7) and on-hand=33, in-transit=0 with no arrivals expected from conclude messages. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 (periods 1\u20134). To respond to the recent lower demand regime while keeping service, use promised lead time and focus forecasting on the most recent 5 demand observations to capture the downward shift and lower variability. This reduces overstock risk (holding cost $1 vs profit $4) while maintaining service via OR backend safety-stock calculation.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has declined from earlier highs (Periods 1-3) to roughly mid-20s in recent weeks (Periods 4-8). Concluded history shows consistent immediate arrivals (observed lead times = 0 each concluded arrival), so use inferred lead time from observations. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) for both demand mean and volatility so orders track the most recent demand pattern and limit holding cost while preserving service. L set to calculated average observed lead time (will be 0) so pipeline coverage matches reality.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in Period 4 (orders arriving same period). Recent realized weekly demand over the last 9 concluded periods is substantially lower than the older historical samples (recent avg ~29 units/week vs historical mean 90), indicating a sustained lower-demand regime. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting service, I align forecast to the recent regime using the last 9 periods for both mean and volatility; keep L at default (promised lead time=0) since arrivals have consistently concluded same-period.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent weekly demand has settled much lower than the early large outlier (recent 10-period mean = 30.6 vs long-run mean 90). On-hand=5, in-transit=0 so pipeline is thin; promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals through Period 10 consistently show lead_time=0. I set L by calculate to reflect observed lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the new low-demand regime ((1+L)*mean over last 10=~30.6) and sigma recent_N (N=10) to capture current volatility. These parameters prioritize service (avoid stockouts given low pipeline) while preventing overstating demand from the early outlier, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and Period 11 showed a large demand spike (131) that caused a stockout (sold only 42). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (P1\u2013P11 arrivals matched orders). To respond to the recent surge while keeping responsiveness (L=0), I use a short recent demand window to raise the forecast: set L=default to keep promised 0, mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 periods) to capture the recent higher mean (21,20,15,37,131 \u2192 mean \u224844.8), and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased volatility. This increases the base-stock to cover the immediate elevated demand signals while relying on same-period arrivals to limit excess holding costs.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and no sustained demand regime change (two high demand spikes P11=131, P12=179 but not 3+ periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no overdue/lost shipments visible. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical weekly samples \u2014 this keeps the baseline forecast anchored to full history (avoids overreacting to two recent spikes) while the capped ordering policy will limit excessive orders and balance profit vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

No overdue shipments visible; past concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0. To capture the recent elevated demand I set L via observed lead times and use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend targets service for the new regime while keeping holding costs moderate.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=123, in-transit=0; no shipments currently overdue. Historical concludes show a sustained demand increase starting Period 11 (demands: P11=131, P12=179, P13=70, P14=50). To capture the new higher-demand regime I set L to default (promised lead time = 0, confirmed historically) and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the four most recent periods (the detected regime). This raises target base-stock to improve service during the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N quantifies higher variability to avoid stockouts; default L keeps orders same-day as confirmed.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg demand increased from ~36 (Periods 1-10) to 107 (Periods 11-14), +197% (evidence: P11=131, P12=179, P13=70, P14=50).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand regime (P11\u2013P15) remains elevated vs earlier history: samples P11\u2013P15 = [131,179,70,50,21], recent mean \u224890.2. On-hand=136, in-transit=0; with L=0 orders arrive same period so available to meet Period 16 demand (decision is before arrival). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand I capture the recent high-demand regime using recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples \u224890.2, which keeps the base-stock responsive to the new regime while avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings balance service (higher mu_hat for increased demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 11 (P11-16 demands = 131,179,70,50,21,24; recent mean ~79). On-hand=121, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (Periods 1-16 concluded arrivals same period). I set L=default to use promised lead time=0. To capture the new higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (reflecting Periods 11-16). This biases base_stock toward the elevated mean while limiting exposure to older low-demand samples, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) and holding cost risk.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand regime (Periods 11-17) shows elevated and then softening demand: [131,179,70,50,21,24,8]. On-hand=125, in-transit=0; with 0 promised lead time arrivals happen same period so inventory is ample for short-term but demand volatility remains. Use L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed historically as 0). For demand estimate, use recent_N with N=7 (regime from Period 11 onward, length=7) so mu_hat reflects the current post-changepoint mean across the review+lead horizon. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to capture recent volatility rather than long-ago low-variance history. These choices prioritize capturing the confirmed regime shift while limiting exposure to holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in prior concludes). Demand regime shifted up at Period 11 but recent weeks (P11- P18 = 131,179,70,50,21,24,8,5) show a decline after the spike; current on-hand=120, in-transit=0 which is ample for near-term demand. I set L=default to keep promised lead time=0 (consistent with confirmed observations). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 (the length of the current post-changepoint regime P11\u2013P18) so the OR engine focuses on the most recent demand behavior (captures the spike and subsequent decline) when computing base stock and cap. This balances service (captures elevated mean from the regime) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent demand has fallen sharply from the high regime at P11-14; last five demands (P15-P19)=21,24,8,5,4 (mean=12.4). On-hand=116, in-transit=0; lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstock given high holding cost and recent low demand, set lead time by observed average and forecast using the most recent 5 weeks. This yields a 1-period (review+lead) demand forecast based on recent behavior and a matching recent volatility estimate to keep service but limit holding costs.

Lead time previously confirmed as 0; no new lead-time evidence. To avoid excess holding cost while matching current low demand, set L to default (promised 0). Forecast demand using most recent 5 weeks to capture the new low regime: mu_hat recent_N with N=5; sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent lower volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has collapsed from the elevated regime in P11-14 (~107 avg) to very low weekly sales in P18-21 = [5,4,1,4]. On-hand = 111, in-transit = 0; no overdue arrivals. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (consistent multiple periods). I therefore keep L as default (promised 0). To reflect the clear, sustained drop I use recent_N for demand parameters based on the 4 most recent periods (P18-21) so the OR engine targets a much lower base-stock and avoids heavy holding cost. Recent_N N=4 is chosen because the new low-demand regime spans 4 periods. Sigma is also recent_N N=4 to reflect reduced volatility in the new regime. These settings reduce ordering and holding while preserving service for current low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: avg demand fell from ~107 (Periods 11-14) to 3.5 (Periods 18-21), -96.7% (evidence: P18=5, P19=4, P20=1, P21=4).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent regime: demand collapsed starting Period 18 (P18-22 demands = 5,4,1,4,0). On-hand=111, in-transit=0 so ample stock vs current low demand. Lead time historically confirmed 0 (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=0). To reflect the new low-demand regime I use recent_N on the last 5 samples (Periods 18-22) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current low mean and low variance. L set to default (promised 0) consistent with observed 0 lead time. This keeps orders small (OR backend will compute base_stock from recent low mu and sigma), reducing holding cost while maintaining service given high profit/holding ratio.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has been low and stable since Period 18 (P18-23 demands = 5,4,1,4,0,2; mean\u22482.67), well below the earlier spike at P11-14. On-hand=109, in-transit=0; pipeline covers nothing. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I therefore set L=default to use promised lead time (0). To align the OR model with the new low-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 6 periods (P18-23) where the regime has been stable (N=6). This keeps target stock low to avoid holding costs while maintaining service for the current low demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed have arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Demand has been in a low regime since Period 18 (P18-P24 demands = 5,4,1,4,0,2,12); no sustained spike yet. To avoid overstock while covering immediate demand, set demand estimates based on the recent low-demand regime (use last 7 periods). This reduces target base-stock vs. using the earlier high-demand periods and limits holding cost exposure.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Demand history shows past high spike (Periods 11-14) then long low regime (Periods 18-25) with some recent uptick (P24=12, P25=20) but not yet sustained for 3+ periods. To avoid overreacting to the short uptick and given holding cost>0, use baseline estimators. Set L to default (promised LT=0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost while relying on confirmed LT=0 and full sample statistics.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 0 (arrivals observed same period). Current on-hand=65, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history shows earlier high-variance regime changes, but recent 9 periods (P18-P26) exhibit low-to-moderate weekly demand (avg ~12 including recent upticks), and holding cost is significant relative to profit. Use default lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period LT and use default \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 so the OR backend applies the long-run sample statistics (stable approach given multiple regime shifts and limited evidence of a new sustained trend). This balances service level (using backend's profit/holding tradeoff) while avoiding extra stocking risk given current ample on-hand inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=50, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (multiple confirms). Demand has risen recently after a prolonged low regime (Periods 18-21 avg ~3.5) \u2014 last 4 concluded demands (Periods 24-27) = {12,20,22,36} indicate a new, higher regime. To react quickly I keep L as default (promised 0) and set demand forecasts using the most recent short regime: mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to capture the post-dip rebound; sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to cover the higher recent demand while avoiding overcommitment from older low-demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24: avg increased from ~3.5 (Periods 18-21) to 22.5 (Periods 24-27), +543% (evidence: P18-21 avg=3.5; P24=12, P25=20, P26=22, P27=36).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Recent demand has re-entered a higher regime starting at Period 24 (P24-27 demands=12,20,22,36; P28=27) so I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture current higher weekly demand. Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 0 periods (confirmed in conclude messages), so I keep default promised lead time. Profit/holding ratio implies a high target service level (q\u22480.8), so using recent-N mean/std (N=4) raises base stock to avoid stockouts while limiting excess inventory given holding cost. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must target the recent elevated regime to avoid stockouts. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (covering P24\u2013P29) to reflect the sustained higher demand and its volatility; this raises the base-stock to protect service while the OR backend will cap orders. No overdue arrivals or lost shipments observed.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (many periods). Recent demand: last periods show high volatility with a single large spike at P30=172 but only one-period evidence of a new regime. I therefore keep promised lead time (use default) and use a recent demand estimate to be responsive while avoiding over-commit on a single spike: mu_hat set to recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent short-window average including P26-P30 demand: 22,36,27,40,172) so (1+L)*mean reflects near-term demand; sigma_hat left as default to rely on full-sample volatility scaling. This balances service (respond to recent uptick) vs holding cost given zero on-hand/pipeline and uncertain persistence of the spike.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (many periods P1-P31 arrivals same-period). Demand recently spiked: Periods 29-31 = [40,172,186] with Periods 27-31 = [36,27,40,172,186], suggesting a new high-demand regime starting around P30 but only 3\u20135 most recent periods reflect it. To be responsive to the apparent recent uplift while keeping variance estimation local, set L to default (promised lead time=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 samples to capture the recent spike: balances service level vs holding cost by targeting higher base-stock given observed surge).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a clear demand upswing starting Period 30 (P30=172, P31=186, P32=234). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (concluded arrivals every period). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded lead times =0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (use last 3 weeks P30-32) so the OR backend will target a much higher base-stock and account for elevated variability; this balances service (avoid stockouts after three consecutive large spikes) against holding cost given limited on-hand/pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand increased from ~22.5 (Periods 24-27) to 197.33 (Periods 30-32), +777% (evidence: P30=172, P31=186, P32=234).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has been a sustained high regime since Period 30 (P30=172, P31=186, P32=234, P33=352). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet ongoing high demand. Lead time has consistently concluded as 0 historically; we'll keep promised/default lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand parameters using the last 4 periods (Periods 30-33) where the regime shift was observed. This raises the base-stock to cover the high current demand while sigma estimated from the same 4 samples captures recent volatility; this prioritizes service (reduce lost sales) while holding cost remains moderate given zero pipeline.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand regime remains the high-demand regime that began at Period 30 (P30-34 demands = 172,186,234,352,222). On-hand=83, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; no overdue shipments. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 periods). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 so volatility reflects the same recent window. This biases orders toward meeting the elevated recent demand while avoiding over-reaction to older low-demand periods.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand =127, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To protect service during the sustained high-demand regime, set L to promised/default (0). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should reflect the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N on the last 6 periods (regime length 6) to capture current mean and variability and avoid dilution by older low-demand periods. This raises the base-stock and the cap appropriately to balance profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21 (Period 37). On-hand=149, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals on same period). Demand has been in a high regime since Period 30 (P30-36 = 172,186,234,352,222,167,132). I detect a sustained regime (length 7) starting Period 30; to capture recent elevated demand while limiting inventory, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (the recent high-demand regime) so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap reflecting current elevated mean and variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts during high demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=150, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 (concluded arrivals every period). Demand entered a high regime starting Period 30 (P30-37 demands: 172,186,234,352,222,167,132,120). To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set L=default (promised lead time=0) and use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the eight most recent high-demand samples (covers P30\u2013P37). This keeps service high during the confirmed elevated demand while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit excess holding costs.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/04 (Period 39). Recent history shows lead time confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals same period). On-hand=95, in-transit=0 so no pending arrivals. Demand regime since Period 30 has been the high-demand regime (P30-38 demands: 172,186,234,352,222,167,132,120,165). I set L=default to use promised lead time 0 (confirmed). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 (covering Periods 30-38) to capture the current high-demand regime; this biases the base-stock and cap toward serving the elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods. These parameters balance service level (capture recent high mean/volatility) vs holding cost given substantial on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Observed lead time confirmed as 0 in concluded history (consistent arrivals every period). Recent demand has been in the high regime beginning Period 30 (sustained elevated demand through Period 39). On-hand=204, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover today but we must size replenishment to the recent high-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history shows actual L=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201339, regime length=10). Using recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N captures recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the recent high-demand level to avoid stockouts while the OR backend will trade off service vs holding cost using the provided statistics.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=197, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 for all observed orders (consistent zeros across concludes). Recent demand regime is the high-demand regime that began at Period 30 (P30-P40: large spikes; regime length = 11). To capture the current high-demand regime I set L to be estimated from observed lead times (calculate) and use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base-stock and cap on the latest high-demand mean and volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts in the high-demand regime) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=194, in-transit=0. Historical conclues strongly confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple arrivals same period). Recent demand regime since Period 30 is elevated (Periods 30-41 show consistently high weekly demand). To capture current high-demand regime while keeping holdings responsive given lead time=0, I set L to default (promised lead time). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 to base forecast and volatility on the most recent ~12-week high-demand regime (covers Periods 30-41). This focuses the base-stock on the current high mean/variance so the OR backend will replenish to meet elevated demand without relying on outdated low-demand history.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). On-hand=159, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders in P1-P42 that arrived show lead_time=0). Recent demand (Periods 35-42) shows elevated and variable weekly demand but has stabilized relative to the huge spikes earlier; last 8 weeks demand = [167,132,120,165,50,51,47,74], average ~100.75. I use L=default to reflect consistently observed 0 promised/actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast on the most relevant recent regime. For sigma I also use recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory and zero pipeline; no new sustained changepoint detected to record.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=130, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P4 and many later periods). Recent demand shows moderate variability after the large Sept peak: last 8 demands (P36\u2013P43) = [132,120,165,50,51,47,74,29], mean \u2248 83.5. I keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded history strongly supports 0 lead time. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=8 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (captures reduced post-peak demand while still reflecting some higher weeks). I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=8 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to recent demand (avoiding excessive holding cost given already-high on-hand) while maintaining service given observed lead time = 0.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P4 and many subsequent periods). On-hand=81, in-transit=0 so we have no incoming coverage. Recent demand (Periods 39\u201344 = 50,51,47,74,29,49) averages ~50/week and reflects pre-holiday uplift vs. earlier low-season noise. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 target service quantile q=4/(4+1)=0.8), use promised lead time (default L=0) and recent demand estimates to capture the current regime while avoiding bulky inventory buildup. Therefore: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat = recent_N using last N=6 concluded samples to reflect current pre-holiday demand; sigma_hat = recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to elevated weekly demand while limiting excess holding cost given substantial on-hand stock.

Historical data shows multiple past demand regime shifts, but most recent 3 weeks (Periods 43-45) demand = 29, 49, 37, suggesting current demand ~38 units/week. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To keep service for the current high-season volatility while avoiding excess holding, I use recent demand (N=3) to set mu_hat and sigma_hat and keep L at promised default (0). This balances responsiveness to the latest regime without overweighting older, large outlier surges.

Use L=default (promised 0) since conclude history shows consistent 0 lead time. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (last 4 weeks around late Nov\u2013Dec) so the OR engine targets a base-stock aligned with current demand while avoiding overweighting older high-season spikes.
