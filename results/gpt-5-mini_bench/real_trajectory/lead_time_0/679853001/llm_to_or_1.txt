Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u2248101.8 units/week with moderate variability. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we need coverage for the current review+lead period. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence exists yet, and no sustained regime change detected. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility computation so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent concluded history shows the Period 1 order (102) arrived in Period 1 with observed lead_time=0 and demand history (weeks of Jan\u2013Feb: 69,89,133,126,92) implies mean weekly demand ~101.8. On-hand=57, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0 and one observed arrival confirming lead_time=0, I use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (using historical mean) against holding costs without overreacting to limited history or single-period noise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Observed concluded lead times: Period1 and Period2 arrivals both show lead_time=0 (orders placed arrived same period). Recent on-hand=47, in-transit=0. Demand: historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~101.8; more recent two periods show much lower demand (45,46) but this is only 2 periods \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change (require \u22653). Therefore retain promised lead time (default) and use default demand/volatility estimates (use full-sample mean and std) so the OR backend balances service level using long-run data while avoiding premature forecast cuts given limited recent evidence. This also avoids overreacting to a potentially transient dip and leaves pipeline capacity decisions to the OR cap logic.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-36.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 in Periods 1-3 (consistent with promised 0), so set L via calculate. Historical weekly samples (69,89,133,126,92) have mean=101.8, but recent realized demand in Periods 1-3 is 45,46,25 (avg=38.67), a sustained 3-period drop (~62% lower). To respond to this regime shift and avoid excess holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 so the OR engine targets inventory to the lower recent demand profile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed (Periods 1-3): recent avg demand = 38.67 vs historical seed avg = 101.8 (\u221262%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $-13.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent demand has declined and been sustained (recent demands: P2=46, P3=25, P4=24). On-hand=37, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. I set L="calculate" to use observed lead times (historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new low-demand regime and avoid overstocking ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 demands). I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility; these choices lower the base-stock and cap, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the new demand level.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent demand has shifted down and stabilized (recent 5-week avg \u224834.6 vs historical seed avg 101.8). On-hand=4, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals observed and historical concluded lead times = 0. I set L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime (regime length=5 periods of low demand); this yields mu_hat based on the last 5 samples and sigma_hat based on their variability. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the sustained lower demand, avoiding excess holding cost while keeping service for expected demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed in Periods 1,2,3,6 all arrived same period (arrived entries report lead_time=0), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand over the most recent regime (Periods 3-6) = [25,24,33,28], regime length=4; use recent_N with N=4 to capture the lower-demand regime. Setting L via calculate uses observed lead times (0) so review+lead = 1 period; mu_hat recent_N (N=4) produces (1+L)\xd7recent mean to match current low demand; sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) uses recent volatility to avoid overstock from historical high-variance seed data. This keeps target base stock aligned to the new low-demand regime and reduces holding costs while maintaining service given same-period arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 in all arrived orders (Periods 1-3,6-7) so actual lead time appears 0; no evidence of lost shipments. Carry-over identified a demand regime drop starting Period 4 (recent avg ~38.7 vs seed ~101.8). Recent realized demand (Periods 5-7) = [33,28,13], indicating the lower regime persists (3 periods). I set L using calculate to confirm observed lead time=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 (captures the new low-demand regime: mean \u224824.67 over last 3 periods) so the OR backend targets a lower base-stock and reduces overstock risk given profit=holding. This balances service vs holding given few in-transit units and confirmed lower demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand has been persistently low since Period 4. Concluded demands P4\u2013P8 = [24,33,28,13,25], avg \u2248 24.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must set parameters to the new low-demand regime. Lead time observed in concluded history is 0 (all arrivals showed lead_time 0), so use calculate to reflect observed lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast and volatility to the most recent low-demand regime (P4\u2013P8 = 5 periods). This reduces service-level targets versus historical seed and avoids excess holding cost given profit=holding. These parameters help the OR engine compute a smaller base stock aligned to the sustained lower demand and limit overstock risk while keeping reasonable availability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 4: avg demand P4\u2013P8 = 24.6 vs historical seed avg = 101.8 (\u221275.8%), sustained for 5 periods

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (P4\u2013P9 avg \u2248 24.6); latest 5-period average demand (P5\u2013P9) = 22.2. All concluded arrivals show lead_time = 0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the new low-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so base_stock reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean (~22.2). Volatility also updated to recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand variability. On-hand=13, in-transit=0; this policy will let the OR engine compute orders to replenish toward the lower regime while respecting caps and the 0 promised lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent on-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0, so use calculated average lead time=0. Demand has exhibited a sustained downward regime since Period 4 (low, stable demand); to reflect the current low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 7 demand observations (Periods 4\u201310) to scale (1+L) mean and volatility. This keeps replenishment conservative (lower base stock) to avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding_cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been in the lower regime confirmed earlier (P4 onward). On-hand=15, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and historical concluded lead times = 0 when arrivals occurred. I keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time and no evidence of lost shipments. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (periods 4\u201311) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders downward to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given the persistent lower demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained ~25 units/week); on-hand=8, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Promised lead time has consistently been 0 (observed arrivals matched orders with lead_time=0), so use L=default. To capture the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N on the most recent regime (Periods 4\u201312, length=9) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of last 9 samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=9 to reflect observed lower volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering given empty pipeline and balance service vs. holding cost under the confirmed lower-demand regime.

Demand has been in a low regime since Period 4 (P4\u2013P13 demands = [24,33,28,13,25,12,3,5,10,10], n=10). I set L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the confirmed low-demand regime, avoiding overstocks while preserving service given current low mean and observed variance.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20. On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 repeatedly, so use promised lead time (default). Demand has settled to a low regime since Period 4 (carry-over notes). I use recent_N=5 for demand estimates to reflect the latest low-demand periods (Periods 10\u201314: demands ~3,5,10,10,1 -> mean ~5.8) so mu_hat=(1+L)*recent mean captures current low tempo and avoids overstock. Sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect reduced recent volatility. These parameters aim to keep base-stock low (q=0.5 => z*=0) to balance profit vs holding cost given equal profit/holding.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained low sales through Period 15). On-hand=7, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. To capture the persistent lower-demand regime I set lead time to the promised default (historical concludes show lead_time=0). I use recent_N (N=12, periods 4\u201315) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes the (1+L) review+lead demand forecast and uncertainty around the current low-demand regime, trading off service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical seed mean=101.8 but demand has shown a sustained downshift since Period 4; most recent periods (P12\u2013P16) demands = [10,10,1,9,4], recent average = 6.8, so I will forecast using the last 5 periods to capture the current low-demand regime. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time. Using recent_N for mu and sigma keeps base_stock aligned with the current low-demand regime, reducing holding costs while preserving service given q=0.5 (z*=0).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=0 (orders repeatedly arrived same period). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (sustained low sales through Period 17). I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 4\u201317) to capture the sustained low-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=14. This keeps forecast and safety buffer aligned to the confirmed low-demand regime and avoids overstock given equal profit and holding costs (encouraging conservative stocking).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. Recent demand has been persistently low since Period 4 (carry-over notes). All concluded lead times = 0 periods (orders historically arrived same period). I keep L = default (promised lead time = 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime (last 5 demands avg \u22483.2 units) so the backend builds a small base stock; sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent low volatility. This reduces holding cost risk while maintaining service for the sustained low-demand regime.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical seed mean=101.8 but observed demand dropped sharply starting Period 4 and remained low (carry-over insight previously recorded). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use default promised lead time. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 4\u201319), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime. Chose N=16 (Periods 4\u201319) because regime length=16; N = max(min(16,20),3)=16. This biases the OR backend toward lower target stocking and lower cap, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has been persistently very low (Periods 16-20 demands = 4,1,1,0,1; recent mean ~1.4). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Promised lead time 0 is confirmed by multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=0. To capture the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 5 weeks; keep L=default (promised 0) to align with observed deliveries. This reduces order targets and holding cost while maintaining service for the new low-demand regime.

Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 4 (confirmed in carry-over): demand has been well below historical seed. On-hand=10, in-transit=0 and no overdue arrivals. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded messages consistently show 0-period arrivals when orders were placed. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=18 (covering Periods 4\u201321) to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and reduce target base-stock and variability estimates so the OR backend reduces ordering and holding cost while preserving service for current low demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent demand has been at a low sustained regime (carry-over insights note shifts beginning Period 4 and confirmed through Period 9 onward). On-hand=7, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and all concluded lead-time observations = 0, so use default promised LT for stability. Forecast demand using the recent 5-week regime (Periods 18\u201322) to reflect the low current demand (recent sample avg ~1.4/week) so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the reduced mean/volatility and prevent overstock. This balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1 each) by targeting small replenishment tuned to recent realized demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Demand has been in a low regime since Period 4 (sustained ~3+ weeks and confirmed previously), recent demand much lower than historical seed. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must forecast for (1+L) review+lead horizon before any arrival. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 throughout, so use default promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures P4\u2013P23 recent regime length \u224820 periods). This reduces target base-stock to match current lower demand and lowers unnecessary holding given holding cost equals profit. These parameters balance service vs holding by anchoring to the sustained low-demand sample while keeping lead-time at promised value.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 persistently. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 4 (sustained drop); use recent demand to forecast. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the recent low-demand regime (capped at 20 samples) so the OR engine builds base stock appropriate to the new lower mean and observed volatility and avoids excessive holdings given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4 (carry-over notes). Promised lead time has consistently been observed as 0 in concluded history, so I keep L as default (promised). To reflect the sustained low-demand regime and capture recent demand level, I use a recent_N estimate for demand and volatility using the last 5 periods (Periods 21\u201325) to make the forecast responsive to recent pattern while satisfying the N selection rules. This balances service (by targeting recent mean) against holding cost (avoiding carry of legacy higher estimates). No new evidence of lead-time change or a new demand regime to record.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has been in a much lower regime for many periods (confirmed previously: sustained drop starting Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must forecast from recent low-demand behavior. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so use default promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent low-demand regime (periods 22\u201326 avg demand \u224810.2) and its volatility, which avoids overstocking vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently; no lost shipments. Demand regime shifted down starting Period 4 and has persisted; use recent data to reflect current low-demand regime while capturing recent variability (including Period 27 stockout spike). Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 20 samples of observed demand (captures sustained low regime). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility including occasional spikes. These choices provide the OR engine with a demand forecast anchored in the persistent low regime while allowing safety for recent variability; they avoid overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (no evidence of lost/delayed shipments). Recent two periods (P27\u2013P28) show demand spikes (59,58) but this is only 2 periods\u2014not a sustained regime change per carry-over rules. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and volatility from the full sample set, allowing the engine's capped policy to balance service level vs holding cost without overreacting to a short spike.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a clear, sustained spike in Periods 25\u201329 (demands: 16,17,59,58,47; mean=39.4) compared with the prior recent baseline. Promised lead time historically observed as 0; I keep L=default. To capture the recent high-demand regime and elevated volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (Periods 25\u201329). This biases the OR backend toward higher target base-stock and a larger safety buffer to avoid stockouts during the confirmed multi-period spike while accepting higher holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 25 confirmed: avg P25\u2013P29 = 39.4 (demands 16,17,59,58,47), a large and sustained spike vs prior recent baseline (~9.48 over P4\u2013P24).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use default promised L. Demand regime shift detected starting Period 25: recent high demands (P25\u2013P30 = 16,17,59,58,47,117) warrant using recent sample statistics to capture elevated mean and volatility. Chosen L=default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals. mu_hat: recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the six-period high-demand regime (captures spike while meeting OR engine requirement). sigma_hat: recent_N with N=6 to reflect increased volatility during the spike. These parameters raise the base-stock to reduce stockouts during the confirmed high-demand regime while accepting holding cost tradeoff given profit=holding cost parity.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting Period 25: avg P25\u2013P30 = 52.33 vs prior recent baseline ~9.48 (\u2248+451%), sustained 6 periods

Recent demand shows a sustained high regime starting Period 25 (demands P25\u2013P31 = 16,17,59,58,47,117,139) \u2014 a clear elevated-demand regime; I therefore forecast using the recent 7 periods to capture the spike. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep L=default. Using recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend size base-stock and safety stock to this new higher mean and volatility, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Observed lead times in all concluded periods remain 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the elevated recent regime. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N over the confirmed recent regime (N=8) to target (1+L)*mean of last 8 samples (captures the spike). Match sigma_hat to recent_N with N=8 to reflect realized volatility in the same window. These choices prioritize service for the sustained spike while letting the OR backend compute appropriate z based on profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 \u2192 use promised/default. Recent demand shows a strong, sustained high-demand regime since Period 25, with an acute surge in the most recent five periods (P29\u2013P33 demands = 47,117,139,123,264; recent 5-avg = 138). To capture the current elevated mean and high volatility I set L=default, mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the immediate spike (review+lead multiplier =1 since L=0), and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect increased demand variability. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock and a wider safety buffer to avoid stockouts during the confirmed surge while acknowledging high holding cost via the cap mechanism.

Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand: sustained high regime since Period 25 (weeks 25\u201334 show large spike vs prior baseline). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected/overdue. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently. To capture the current high-demand regime, set L to promised (default) and estimate demand using the recent regime sample (Periods 25\u201334, 10 periods). Thus use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds base stock appropriate for the sustained elevated demand while keeping lead-time assumption at default=0.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand regime: large sustained spike starting Period 25 (2019-07-29) with high weekly demand through Period 35 (demands P25\u2013P35: 16,17,59,58,47,117,139,123,264,258,228). Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead_time = 0, so use default lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the regime since Period 25. Regime length = 11 periods (P25\u2013P35) \u2192 choose N=11. This biases the base-stock toward the confirmed elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N uses the same window to reflect increased volatility. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so parameters favor replenishment to cover the (1+L) review+lead window and reduce lost sales while balancing holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 25 (demands P25\u2013P36 large vs earlier baseline). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period ordered), so I use the calculated average lead time. To capture the recent demand spike, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime (N=12, Periods 25\u201336) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the high-demand regime rather than the old low baseline. This increases target base_stock to avoid lost sales while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety stock for variability in the spike.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 25 (multiple periods of large weekly sales through Period 37). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover the elevated recent demand. Historical concluded lead times are 0, so keep promised lead time. To capture the post-Period-25 regime I use recent_N over the regime length (P25\u2013P37 = 13 weeks) for mu and sigma so the OR backend sizes base-stock to the new higher mean and volatility while respecting the promised L=0. This reduces stockouts under the sustained spike while avoiding over-reliance on long-ago low-demand data.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 25 (large sustained weekly demands P25\u2013P38). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must restock to meet ongoing high demand. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 in history, so keep promised lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 14 periods (P25\u2013P38) for both demand mean and volatility so the backend sets a base-stock reflecting the spike while accounting for recent variability.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 25 through Period 39 (many weeks of large sales: 16,17,59,58,47 then large weekly spikes up to 258). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods. To capture the recent high-demand regime while letting OR backend compute safety stock, set L to calculated average of observed lead times (0). Use recent_N=15 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the sustained post-Period-25 regime (regime length 15 periods from P25\u2013P39). This focuses replenishment on the current high-demand level and avoids dilution by older low-demand data, balancing service (avoid lost sales) against holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 25 (large weekly demands from P25\u2013P40). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead times are 0, so use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. To capture the confirmed high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (N=16: Periods 25\u201340) so the base-stock reflects elevated mean demand; set sigma_hat recent_N N=16 to reflect recent volatility. This increases target inventory to meet high demand while the backend's cap prevents extreme orders; with profit=holding (q=0.5) z*=0 so base_stock\u2248mu_hat, balancing service vs holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime starting around Period 25 with especially large weekly demand since Period 30 (periods 30\u201341 all very large). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet current surge. Use promised lead time (0) since concluded history shows lead_time=0 consistently. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the elevated demand regime (periods ~31\u201341) so the base stock reflects the current spike. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture recent volatility during this high-demand period. These choices raise target base stock to prioritize service during the confirmed surge while sigma_hat recent_N informs safety stock to balance holding cost vs lost sales risk.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in the high holiday regime since Periods ~30\u201342 (very large weekly demands, e.g. P30\u2013P42 = 117,139,123,264,258,228,195,206,237,173,189,165,661) \u2014 sustained spike vs earlier low baseline. All concluded lead-time observations show lead_time=0 historically. To supply the current high-demand regime while avoiding excessive holding, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent 13-period high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201342) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the holiday spike and higher volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=110, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 25 (P25\u2013P43 = 19 weeks of elevated demand vs earlier baseline). To reflect the recent sustained regime, use promised lead time (default = 0) and recent_N demand estimates over the recent regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=19 (captures P25\u2013P43 high-demand regime). This biases orders toward covering elevated current demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand samples; using default L keeps OR backend's (1+L) factor aligned with observed 0 lead time.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand has spiked sharply starting Period 42 (Nov\u2013Dec) with four consecutive high demands (P42\u2013P45 = 661,118,101,124). On-hand=45, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time historically observed as 0 periods. I set L=default to trust promised lead time. To capture the current holiday/high-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the most recent 6 demand observations to reflect elevated mean and volatility). This biases the OR backend toward higher base stock and appropriate safety stock for holiday spike while keeping holding cost considered via the backend service-level cap.

Carry-over insight: Seasonal peak confirmed starting Period 42: avg demand P42\u2013P45 = 251 units (661,118,101,124), sustained 4 periods; treat Nov\u2013Dec as high-demand regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent demand shows strong seasonal peak (Nov\u2013Dec) confirmed in history (Periods 42\u201346 high). On-hand=92, in-transit=0 so risk of stockout given elevated demand. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 periods, so use default promised lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent samples (last 6 periods, P41\u2013P46) which reflect the seasonal spike. Use same recent window for volatility estimate so the OR engine targets higher base stock and higher cap to avoid stockouts during this confirmed peak while accepting higher holding cost.
