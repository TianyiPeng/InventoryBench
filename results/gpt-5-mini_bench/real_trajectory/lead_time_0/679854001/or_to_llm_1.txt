Recent realized sales show a sustained low-demand regime: Periods 42\u201346 sold = 24,33,35,27,31 (avg=30 units/week). OR's recommendation (78) is based on older higher-demand history and the promised lead time; with confirmed L=0 and holding cost equal to profit (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), the base-stock target \u2248 single-period mean \u2248 30. Action objective: cover one period of expected demand (L+1=1). Therefore order = max(0, target \u2212 on-hand) = 30 \u2212 4 = 26 units. This minimizes overstock given high holding cost and the clear recent drop in demand. ",
