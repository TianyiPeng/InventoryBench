Recent 5-week average = 11.8; median = 8. Lead time vs missing orders: past conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (orders arrive same period). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 33, in-transit = 0. No overdue or in-transit shipments. Given low expected demand this week and holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $19/unit, avoid adding inventory and let on-hand deplete toward a small safety level. Final order logic: place no order this period to minimize holding cost while maintaining current stock to cover a modest demand spike.",
