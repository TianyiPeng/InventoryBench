Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows lead time = 0 (arrivals same period), so orders placed now arrive this period's demand (but you only see conclude next period). Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=21, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand in Periods 43\u201346 = [6, 1, 9, 8], winter/late-Dec slow-down; no sustained uptick. OR's recommendation (182) uses long-run/earlier high-season samples and a high service fractile (profit >> holding cost), so it hugely overestimates short-term need. Given L=0, we only need to cover current-period demand after ordering. Conservatively forecast one-period demand \u2248 8\u201312 (based on last 4 weeks average = 6); on-hand 21 already covers this. Ordering would incur holding cost $1/unit while risking low turnover. Final strategy: place 0 order. This avoids unnecessary holding cost while meeting expected demand; monitor next concludes to detect any regime change.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Deviating from OR's 182 \u2192 order 0. On-hand 21 exceeds recent weekly demand (6,1,9,8); lead time=0 so no pipeline needed; avoid costly excess inventory.",
