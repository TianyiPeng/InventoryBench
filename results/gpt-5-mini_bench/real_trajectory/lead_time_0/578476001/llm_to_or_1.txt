Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent history (5 weekly samples through 2019-02-04) shows stable weekly demand (59,59,54,63,78). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must rely on forecast and promised lead time (no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time). I choose default lead time so backend uses promised L=0. For demand I use default estimates (all-samples mean and std scaled by 1+L) because there is no clear sustained changepoint or seasonal event and sample count is small. This keeps orders aligned with historical average while avoiding overreaction to the single higher week (78).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded history shows Period1 order (78) arrived in Period1 (lead_time=0). On-hand=6, in-transit=0, recent demand sample mean=62.6 (5 weekly samples). Promised lead time=0 and confirmed by observation, so use L=default. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this targets one-period demand coverage while letting the OR engine balance service vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period1 order: ordered on Period1, arrived on Period1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand has stepped up (recent weeks: 78, 72, 80 vs longer-run mean ~62.6). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in history. To capture the higher recent demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock while keeping L at the confirmed promised value.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent realized demand has risen versus older samples (last 3 periods demands: 72, 80, 73). On-hand=11, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments evident (arrivals in P1\u2013P3 confirmed, lead time observed=0). To capture the recent higher demand regime I use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last three weeks. Lead time is set to calculated average of observed lead times (which is 0) to match confirmed same-period arrivals. These choices raise the backend base-stock to cover the elevated short-run demand while keeping holding cost awareness via sigma_hat.

Daily Reward (R_t): $957.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Recent demand (last 4 conclude periods) = [72,80,73,52], mean=69.25 indicating slightly lower demand in Period 4. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To balance service vs holding cost, keep promised lead time (fast replenishment) and use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects the latest regime.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded demand (Periods 1-5) shows weekly sales: 72, 80, 73, 52, 55; historical sample set (Jan-Feb) has mean ~62.6. On-hand=35, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in conclues, so use promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, providing a stable forecast while avoiding overfit to short recent dips. This balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) by letting the OR engine compute the risk buffer via its z* formula.

Daily Reward (R_t): $658.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has declined from the earlier ~70s to values 52,55,37 in Periods 4-6 indicating a lower recent regime. On-hand=45, in-transit=0 and confirmed short lead time historically. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (previously confirmed as 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the latest lower regime (Periods 4-6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stocking for the new lower mean while keeping safety stock tuned to recent volatility. This reduces overstock risk given current on-hand inventory and low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent weekly demand has fallen from the early-period highs (72,80,73) to lower values (52,55,37,51). On-hand=13, in-transit=0 so coverage is low vs. recent demand. No overdue shipments observed; concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (most recent 5 weeks: 73,52,55,37,51) to capture the recent lower regime and avoid overweighting earlier high weeks. I also use recent_N N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices tighten the base-stock to recent demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded demands show a downward shift from early high weeks (72,80,73) to a lower regime in Periods 4-8: [52,55,37,51,42] (mean\u224847.4, std\u22486.77). On-hand=33, in-transit=0, and lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L via calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (most recent regime, N=5) so the OR backend targets (1+L)*mean\u224847.4 demand and uses recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Daily Reward (R_t): $560.00

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent observed demands show a sustained drop beginning Period 4: Periods1-3 avg demand = 75 units, Periods4-9 avg = 44.67 units (-40%). All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 periods. On-hand = 29, in-transit = 0. To avoid overstocking given lower recent demand while preserving service, set L by averaging observed lead times and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime (use last 6 periods, Periods4-9). Sigma set from same recent sample to reflect lower volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 4: avg demand decreased from 75 (Periods1-3) to 44.67 (Periods4-9), \u221240% sustained over 6 periods

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 4 (already recorded). No evidence of lead-time changes (recent concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To keep service high (profit $19 vs hold $1 \u2192 target service ~95%) while not overstocking given the lower regime, use the promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates from the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 6 periods of demand to reflect the sustained lower mean/volatility and let the OR backend compute safety stock for q\u22480.95.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4; last 8 periods (P4\u2013P11) avg demand \u224839 units/week with lower variance. Promised lead time=0 and historical conclues consistently show same-period arrivals, so keep L as default (promised=0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (captures current mean and volatility over P4\u2013P11). This reduces target base stock vs. long-run mean, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for current demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 4 (Periods 4-12 average demand ~44.67). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historically confirmed actual lead time=0 (multiple concluded arrivals). To reflect the post-changepoint regime I use recent_N over the last 9 demand observations (Periods4-12) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower, stable demand; L uses default promised lead time=0. This reduces excess holding while preserving service level for the new lower mean demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=41, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments visible. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time 0 across many periods and a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 4 (already recorded). To be conservative and let the OR engine use full historical statistics for forecasting and safety stock, I select default lead time and default demand moments so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 4 (Periods4-14 lower mean). I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods4-14) to capture the sustained lower-demand regime; same N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned with the lower-demand regime and avoids overstock given holding cost and no missing shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (confirmed in prior periods), and recent demand has been in the lower regime documented previously. I therefore set lead time via 'calculate' (average of observed lead times => 0). Given no strong new short-term demand signal beyond the documented regime shift, use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps base-stock conservative (lower \u03bc\u0302 reflecting decreased demand) while leveraging backend service-level math to trade off profit vs. holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). On-hand=76, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=0 and a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 4 (avg demand ~44.7). I keep L as default (promised=0). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the entire post-changepoint regime (Periods 4\u201316, 13 samples) so the OR engine targets a lower base stock and lower cap, reducing holding cost while preserving service. This also accounts for zero pipeline (no arrivals expected) so orders will only top up to the regime-adjusted base stock.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To avoid excess holding cost while protecting service on current low-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the base-stock on the most recent low-variance regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals). Demand has been suppressed recently (last 6 demands: 19,17,14,6,8,7 \u2192 mean \u224811.83). To avoid overstock while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (default) and use recent demand for forecast and volatility: mu_hat recent_N with N=6 ((1+L)*mean of last 6 samples) and sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 (sqrt(1+L)*std of last 6 samples). This downweights older high-demand periods and reduces ordering given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent demand is in the lower regime established at Period 4 (sustained drop); last 7 observed weekly demands (Periods 13-19) are 19,17,14,6,8,7,7 \u2014 substantially below early-period levels. On-hand=54, in-transit=0, so no incoming arrivals expected. I set L to default (promised 0) because lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed previously). For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most relevant recent samples. This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service for the sustained lower demand pattern given the low holding cost (H=$1) vs profit ($19).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 4, confirmed earlier; latest 6 periods show very low weekly demand (Periods15-20 avg \u22487.3). On-hand=52, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for near-term demand but we should reflect the low recent demand in forecasts to avoid excess holding cost. L: use default promised lead time (0), consistent with confirmed early evidence. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=6 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent low-demand regime. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=6 to capture recent lower volatility. These choices reduce order targets to match the sustained lower demand and limit holding cost while preserving service given current inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (many observed arrivals with lead_time=0), so set L using observed lead times. Demand regime dropped at Period 4 and has remained lower through Period 21; use recent data to forecast. Choose mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (last 18 concluded demand samples, Periods 4\u201321) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the sustained lower demand and reduced volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned to current lower demand while avoiding excess holding cost given holding=$1/unit and profit=$19/unit.

Use L=default to keep promised lead time (0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the latest low-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent reduced volatility. This keeps target base-stock small to avoid holding costs while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22. On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Recent 8 periods (P16\u2013P23) show a sustained, large drop in demand versus earlier periods. Use L=default (promised lead time=0) since concluded arrivals confirm 0 historically. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the new low-demand regime (reduces target base-stock and holding). This avoids overstock given many low-demand weeks while preserving service for the current low-rate demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 16: avg demand decreased from 32.5 (Periods4\u201315) to 5.25 (Periods16\u201323), \u221283.8% sustained over 8 periods

I set L to default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods16\u201324) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 9 samples and sigma_hat uses the same 9-sample window to reflect current volatility. This keeps target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while meeting modest demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 (confirmed early periods). Demand regime has been low since Period 16 (carry-over shows sustained drop); recent demand has a small uptick at Period 25 (24 units). To balance service vs holding cost I use a recent_N estimate (N=10) to capture the low-regime demand while allowing the recent spike to influence mean and volatility; keep L=default (promised 0).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 after a large single-week sale (Period26 demand=94) but this spike is isolated vs. a sustained low-demand regime since Period16. Lead time previously confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals). I keep L as default (promise=0) to match observed arrivals. To be responsive to the recent spike while damping single-week noise, I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) so the forecast updates toward recent demand without overreacting. I keep sigma_hat as default to reflect long-run variability. This raises the base-stock moderately to reduce stockout risk while holding costs remain low (holding=$1 vs profit=$19).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 each period \u2192 keep promised lead time. Recent demand shows a sharp uptick starting Period 26 (Period25-27 demands = 24, 94, 104). This appears to be an emerging regime but is only 2 high-demand periods so far; to be responsive while conservative, I use a short recent window of N=3 to capture the spike without over-committing. Thus: L kept as default (promised 0). mu_hat set using recent_N with N=3 to reflect mean of last 3 demands across review+lead period. sigma_hat set using recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to better cover the recent demand surge while keeping risk of excess holding limited (holding cost low relative to profit).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Recent data show a sustained demand spike starting Period 26 (Periods 26-28 demands = 94, 104, 89) after a long low-demand regime. Promised lead time has been repeatedly observed as 0; use default L to let backend assume promised lead time. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new high-demand regime (mean \u224895.7 over Periods26-28). Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the recent surge. These choices ensure the OR backend targets service for the current high-demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive to recent volatility. On-hand + pipeline (57) is below the recent 1-period mean, so the backend will raise ordering to cover the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: avg demand over Periods26-28 = 95.7 (Periods16-25 avg \u22485.25) \u2014 +~1718%, sustained 3 periods

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02): recent data shows a pronounced demand spike starting Period 26 (periods 26-29 demand = 94,104,89,80) \u2014 a new high-demand regime of length 4. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically. On-hand = 29, in-transit = 0, so pipeline is empty and current stock is low relative to the recent regime. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded lead times are 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (N chosen = regime length =4). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These parameters steer the OR backend to raise the base stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand under the new regime, improving service while keeping holding cost calibrated to recent variability.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period (orders ordered and arrived same period), so keep L as promised (default). Demand shows a clear recent regime shift starting Period 26 with high weekly demand (Periods 26-30: 94,104,89,80,128) \u2014 sustained 5 periods; therefore forecast and volatility should be based on the recent high-demand regime. Use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 26\u201330) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)-scaled mean/std reflect the spike and avoid understocking given current zero inventory. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by targeting service during the high-demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent sustained high-demand regime since Period 26 (large spike: Periods26-31 show high weekly sales) while current on-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical lead times have consistently concluded as 0. To align the OR base-stock with the new high-demand regime, set L to default (promised lead time=0) and estimate demand using a recent_N window capturing the new regime (last 6 periods, Periods26-31). Use the same recent_N window for volatility. This raises the backend's (1+L)\xd7mean and std to reduce stockouts while holding cost is low relative to profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand regime shifted sharply starting Period 26 (sustained high weekly demand: Periods26-32 = [94,104,89,80,128,129,114]); use a recent-window forecast to capture the new high-demand regime. Set L to default/promised (0) to match observed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the seven-week high-demand regime, reducing stockouts while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent data show a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 26 (demands: P26=94, P27=104, P28=89, P29=80, P30=128, P31=129, P32=114, P33=230). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand plus lead coverage. Lead-time observations consistently show 0 periods (confirmed historically). To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the detected recent regime (Periods 26\u201333, length=8) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the recent high-demand samples. L kept default (promised 0) since observed lead time remains 0. This balances higher service level needed for the clear demand spike while letting the backend compute the z* tradeoff using profit vs holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent history shows a clear, sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 26 with very high weekly demand (Periods26-34 mean \u2248129.1). On-hand=6, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time has repeatedly been observed as 0; I keep L as default to match supplier promise. To capture the new high-demand regime, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=9 (Periods26-34) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 9 samples (~129.1 demand/week). Sigma_hat is also recent_N with N=9 to reflect volatility in the same regime. These choices supply the OR engine with a demand forecast and variability aligned to the sustained high-demand period, enabling higher base-stock to avoid lost sales while the low holding cost ($1) limits inventory penalty.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: avg demand increased from 5.25 (Periods16-25) to 129.11 (Periods26-34), +~2359%, sustained 9 periods (P26\u2013P34).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed P1 arrival=P1); use promised lead time. Demand regime: sustained high demand since Period 26 (P26\u2013P36 = 11 periods of elevated sales; previously recorded). To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (covers P26\u2013P36). This focuses the base-stock on the current high-demand regime while keeping lead time at 0 so orders arrive same period. This balances service (avoid stockouts during elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent-regime mean and volatility rather than all-time averages.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent history shows a sustained, large demand regime beginning Period 26 that continues through Period 37 (12 periods). On-hand=48, in-transit=0; promised lead time = 0 and concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0). Demand forecast should reflect the high-demand regime (changepoint at P26). I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 26\u201337) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean and volatility; this balances service (captures current high mean ~134.7 units/week) against holding costs, and avoids diluting the forecast with much earlier, much lower demand periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26 confirmed and sustained through Period 37: avg demand Period26\u201337 = 134.67 (Periods16\u201325 avg \u2248 5.25) \u2014 +~2466%, sustained 12 periods

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 26 (Periods 26\u201338 average demand elevated). On-hand=72, in-transit=0 \u2014 enough cover for only a short window vs. elevated demand. I keep L=default (promised 0) because concluded messages consistently show 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=13 to target the current high-demand regime (Periods26\u201338 length=13) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and caps appropriately; this raises target base-stock to meet service during the sustained higher demand while sigma from the same recent window captures current volatility. No evidence of new lost shipments or regime changes requiring carry-over update.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26 (average ~134.7 through Period 37 and continued strong sales Periods 38\u201339). On-hand = 63, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time = 0 and observed lead times have been 0 consistently, so use default lead time. To capture the sustained high-demand regime, estimate demand using the most recent contiguous high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201339, length 14). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 14 samples, which balances service level (covering elevated demand) against holding cost given high profit margin.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 26 (large, sustained increases through Period 37 and continuing in later weeks). On-hand=79, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes consistently show lead_time=0. I choose L=default to use the promised (and confirmed) lead time. For demand I target the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=15 (Periods 26\u201340) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 15 samples; use recent_N N=15 for sigma_hat to capture volatility in this regime. This focuses the base-stock on the current elevated demand to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost awareness (holding cost low relative to profit).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=109, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods). Demand regime has been the high regime starting Period 26 and sustained through recent periods (P26\u2013P41). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) since concluded history confirms it. To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (covering Periods 26\u201341) so the OR engine's base-stock and cap reflect the sustained elevated mean and volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts in the high regime) against holding cost given large on-hand stock.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 26 (large, persistent spike through Period 42). On-hand=11, in-transit=0 so available supply is very low vs. recent demand. Use promised lead time (confirmed historically as 0). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 26\u201342, length 17) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current high-demand regime and avoid averaging down with the low-demand earlier periods. This raises the base-stock to reduce stockouts while the capped order will limit extreme overordering given holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=132, in-transit=0. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 26 (large spike Sep\u2013Nov). Profit/holding implies high service target (q\u22480.95). To reflect recent high demand while keeping lead time = promised, set L=default. Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the last ~3 months of high-demand observations and capture recent volatility; this supplies a higher base_stock while limiting exposure to older low-demand periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders arriving same period). Demand experienced a sustained high regime from Period 26 onward (avg ~135/week) with recent large weekly variability, and current on-hand=108, in-transit=0. To keep the OR backend aligned with proven lead time and full-sample demand statistics while letting the engine compute the base-stock and cap using observed history, I select default lead time and default demand moments. This preserves the backend's use of all samples to reflect the large post-Period-26 demand increase while avoiding ad-hoc truncation; with L=0 the policy will order to cover one period of demand plus safety stock, balancing high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time has been 0 (confirmed repeatedly). Demand exhibits a sustained high regime starting Period 26 (large, persistent increases through Period 45). To capture the current high-demand regime I set L=default (use promised lead time=0) and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes mean/volatility from the most recent 20 demand samples (Periods 26\u201345), aligning base-stock to the elevated demand while limiting exposure to older low-demand periods. This balances service (capture high recent mean) vs holding cost by using recent volatility instead of pooling all historical low-variance periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime starting Period 26 confirmed through Period 45: avg demand Period26\u201345 = 130.5 (Periods16\u201325 avg \u2248 5.25) \u2014 +~2390%, sustained 20 periods
