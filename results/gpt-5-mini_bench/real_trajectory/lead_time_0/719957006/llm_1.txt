Lead time & pipeline: Promised lead time = 0 but no concluded arrivals yet to confirm; actual lead time uncertain. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so no coverage for current period. Inventory economics: Profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding cost is small relative to profit, so erring toward slightly higher safety stock is sensible. Forecast & order logic: Use the 5-week average (~82) as expected weekly demand and protect against at least one potential period of delivery delay by covering ~2 weeks of demand. Therefore order 164 units to cover current period demand (which will occur after decision) and a likely next period if arrival is delayed.",
