Extrapolating yields ~32 units for 2019-02-11. c) Lead time / lost orders: Supplier promised LT=0 but no concluded arrivals observed yet; actual LT is unknown and shipments can be delayed or lost. Assume risk of LT>=0; do not rely on past arrivals. d) Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. To meet expected demand this period given LT uncertainty, we must order enough to cover anticipated demand plus modest safety stock. e) Order logic: target demand ~32 units; add ~20% safety to guard against variability and potential arrival delays while limiting holding cost (holding=$1/unit/period vs profit $4).
