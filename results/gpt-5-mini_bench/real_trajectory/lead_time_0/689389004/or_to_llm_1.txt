Because lead time is confirmed as 0, any order placed will arrive within the same period and can immediately satisfy demand; however profit = holding cost (1=$1, holding=$1) so overstock is costly and we should avoid large excess inventory. Given the sharp increase in recent demand (especially the 151 observation), I increase the order above OR to reduce stockouts this period while limiting excess.
