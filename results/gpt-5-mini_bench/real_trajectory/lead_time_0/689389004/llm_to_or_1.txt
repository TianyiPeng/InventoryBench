Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no conclude messages to infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5): 60,56,82,71,107 \u2192 mean=75.2 units/week. With promised L=0, use default forecasting: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean = 75.2 (backend will compute). Demand variability across samples (std \u2248 20.5) will be used by backend via default sigma_hat. Default choices balance service (use historical mean) vs holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1/unit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order arriving with observed lead_time=0 and demand=86. Historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show varied weekly demand including a recent high (107). I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (recent observed = 0). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost (profit=holding -> q\u22480.5, so base stock near mean). This is conservative given limited new evidence and no sustained regime change.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show orders in Periods 1\u20132 arrived same period (observed lead_times = 0). Recent demand has risen (historic weeks: 60,56,82,71,107; concluded demands: 86,151) but the high values are only two consecutive periods\u2014insufficient to call a sustained regime change. I set L to the observed average lead time (calculate) = 0. For demand forecast I use the most recent 3 weeks to capture the emerging higher level while remaining conservative: mu_hat recent_N N=3 (uses samples 107,86,151 => mean \u2248114.7, multiplied by (1+L)=1). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters balance higher service level to avoid lost sales during the recent uptick while avoiding overcommitment given limited evidence of a sustained shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows three consecutive orders arriving with actual lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u20133). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Demand samples provided (five weeks Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~75; Period 2 spike to 151 appears isolated. No sustained regime shift detected. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and std ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps parameters stable given limited evidence of a persistent demand increase and avoids overstock risk when profit and holding cost are equal (q=0.5).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows actual lead_time=0 in Periods 1\u20134. Recent demand (concluded periods 1\u20134) = [86,151,78,62] shows elevated variability and a spike in Period 2; using recent data helps adapt forecasts. Set L by calculated average observed lead times (0). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, balancing service vs holding given current on-hand and no pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent observed concluded demands: P1-5 demands = [86, 151, 78, 62, 57]; last 3 periods show a lower regime (78,62,57) suggesting demand has fallen to ~65/week. On-hand=38, in-transit=0 and all concluded arrivals have been same-period (lead_time=0). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) given consistent same-period arrivals. I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=3 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the recent lower-demand regime, and sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk while maintaining service for the new, lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (orders in Periods 1-5 arrived same period on P1-P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Context: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-6) = [86,151,78,62,57,81]; demand appears lower after the large spike in Period 2 but no sustained multi-period shift aside from that spike. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To keep the forecast responsive to the most recent regime while leveraging short sample size, I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility (captures Periods 2-6 excluding the oldest sample), and default promised lead time (0). This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost by adapting to the most recent demand level while keeping lead time at observed 0 so orders can arrive same period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 3-7) = [78,62,57,81,117], mean \u224879; volatility visible but not a sustained large shift vs. earlier sample mean. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. I choose L=default to rely on promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the latest 5 weeks (captures current variability and recent upticks) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service (meeting recent higher peaks) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand (Periods 4-8) shows a higher, more volatile regime vs. the early-Jan samples: recent demands = [62,57,81,117,141], mean \u2248 91.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; confirmed lead time = 0 in history. To respond to the recent higher mean and preserve service while avoiding excess holding cost, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 \u2248 91.6). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent variability for safety stock calculation.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical observed concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0). Recent demand episodes often exceed single-order receipts (demand spikes to 140s), but no evidence of lost shipments. I therefore use L default (promised lead time=0) and default demand estimators so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the backend cap limits order size to mitigate overstock given holding cost = profit. Defaults are conservative given no new sustained regime change.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand has been elevated and variable: last 5 demands (Periods 6\u201310) = [81,117,141,72,62], recent average \u224894.6 units/week. On-hand=26, in-transit=0 \u2014 insufficient to cover the next review+lead period demand (~95). Historical conclude messages confirm lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). To respond to the recent higher demand regime while leveraging confirmed same-day arrivals, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent regime (captures the recent spike and variability). This produces a higher base_stock target to reduce stockouts while the capped order cap limits extreme ordering to control holding costs.

Use promised/default lead time (0) because concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time. Use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals P1\u2013P12 all show lead time = 0 (confirmed same-period arrivals); demand in recent periods has settled around ~85/wk. I set L to default (promised 0, consistent with observed P1\u2013P12). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 concluded demand samples: P8\u2013P12 = 141,72,62,90,61) to capture the current regime (mean \u224885.2, std \u224829.8). Using recent data keeps the base-stock responsive to the current demand level while avoiding overweighting older winter samples; sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility for safety stock sizing.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent observed lead time has consistently been 0 (confirmed through Period 6 conclude onward). On-hand = 51, in-transit = 0; recent demand has softened (last 5 demands: 72,62,90,61,35; mean=64) so I bias forecast to recent regime. Set L=default to use promised lead time (0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand level across the review+lead period. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture recent demand volatility and avoid overstock from older high-variance samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed earlier). Recent demand has softened starting Period 13 (demands: P12=61, P13=35, P14=31) suggesting a lower recent mean. To be responsive to the recent lower regime while retaining stability, use promised lead time (default L=0) and compute demand over the last 3 periods (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory for the reduced recent demand while the 0 lead time keeps review+lead horizon short.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 16 (2019-05-27). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time 0 (Periods 1\u201315 all arrived same period). On-hand=18, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Recent demand has softened but not enough sustained shift (only 3 low weeks). Given confirmed L=0 and balanced profit/holding ($1/$1), use defaults so OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full history to set base-stock and cap automatically.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Actual lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes. Recent demand has dropped substantially versus earlier weeks (see history). To avoid overstock while preserving service, keep L as default (promised=0). Use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5, periods 12-16) to reflect the new, lower regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine reduces target base-stock and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 12: avg demand P1-P11 = 90.64 units/week vs avg demand P12-P16 = 33.8 units/week (\u221262.7%), sustained 5 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Confirmed same-period lead times historically. To avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding cost, set lead time from observed data and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime (use recent_N over the last 6 weeks P12-P17) so the OR backend sizes base stock to current lower mean while reflecting recent variability.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). Recent demand has dropped sharply since Period 12 (avg P1-11 \u224890.6 vs P12-18 \u224826.3); on-hand=22, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstocking given the new low-demand regime, use recent_N demand estimates anchored on the post-changepoint data (most recent regime). Chosen methods: L=default (trust promised/observed 0), mu_hat=recent_N with N=7 to base forecast on Periods 12\u201318, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to capture recent lower volatility. This reduces target base-stock to match the sustained lower demand, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent data shows a sustained demand drop starting Period 12 (weeks 12\u201319 lower than earlier). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To capture the new low-demand regime, set demand estimates based on the most recent regime samples (Periods 12\u201319, 8 weeks). Choices: L calculated from observed lead times (will confirm 0), mu_hat = recent_N with N=8 to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the recent low-demand regime, sigma_hat = recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock and holding cost while preserving service for the lower-demand regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1-20 concludes). Demand regime shift began at Period 12: mean P1-P11 = 90.64 vs mean P12-P20 \u2248 33.8 (sustained low demand). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals) and estimate demand using the most recent regime (Periods 12\u201320). Therefore use recent_N with N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 9 samples; this reduces target base-stock to match the ~34/week demand and avoids excess holding under equal profit/holding (q=0.5) while preserving service.

To avoid overstocking while covering (1+L) review+lead demand, keep L=default (promised 0, confirmed by arrivals) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 13-22 window covering the post-changepoint regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent low-demand samples, reducing target base-stock and holding cost risk given current zero inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date: 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently through Period 23. A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 12: avg demand P1-P11 = 90.64 vs avg P12-P16 = 33.8 (\u221262.7%) and low demand continued through recent weeks. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=12 (the post-changepoint regime from Period 12 through Period 23) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant low-demand regime. This reduces target base stock and cap, lowering overstock risk and holding costs while preserving service for the new lower-demand regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time 0 and a sustained lower-demand regime beginning Period 12 (P12\u2013P24 recent behavior). To respect the confirmed same-period arrivals use promised lead time. Forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime (to avoid overstocking): set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the last 13 periods (P12\u2013P24) which capture the sustained lower mean/variance. This keeps target base-stock conservative to balance $1 profit vs $1 holding cost and avoids excess ending inventory given low recent demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 12 (P1-11 avg=90.64 vs P12-16 avg=33.8). I will use promised/default lead time behavior (0) and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime. I choose recent_N with N=14 (Periods 12\u201325) to capture the post-change regime mean and volatility; this keeps target base_stock aligned with the lower sustained demand and limits holding cost risk given profit=holding. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current variability. These parameters help the OR backend reduce overstock from the earlier high-demand regime while maintaining service for the new lower-demand level.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history shows a sustained, lower-demand regime starting Period 12; mean demand over Periods 12\u201326 = 32.07 units/week. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must restock for immediate-period demand. Choose L=default to trust confirmed 0-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to center forecasts on the new low-demand regime (covers Periods 12\u201326). This keeps base_stock aligned with the observed lower mean and reduces overstock/holding cost while preserving service for the current regime.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 12 (avg P12-P27 well below P1-P11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods; use promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to reflect the lower mean and volatility (N=16 covers Period12\u2013Period27). This reduces target base stock and holding risk while maintaining service for the new lower-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand dropped starting Period 12 (P12\u2013P28 is the recent low-demand regime). No overdue shipments. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I set L=default to use promised (and observed) 0; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N over the recent regime (N=17, Periods 12\u201328) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the current lower-demand data, reducing overstock while preserving service.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show lead time = 0. Demand dropped starting Period 12 and has remained at a lower regime; using recent demand to avoid inflating forecast with pre-change high demand. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 (Periods 12\u201329) so the OR engine targets the lower recent mean and reduced volatility, minimizing holding cost while preserving service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 so use observed average. Demand recently increased versus the low regime around Periods 12-16; to capture the current higher summer demand I use a recent-window forecast (last 8 weeks) for mean and volatility so the OR backend raises target stock without assuming old low-demand regime. These parameters balance service (cover recent higher demand) versus holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than long-run average.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand (last several weeks) has rebounded from the low mid-May stretch, so I base forecasts on the most recent data window rather than the entire historical series. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) which matches observed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand level/volatility and reduce stockouts while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0; use promised lead time (default). Demand dropped sharply starting Period 12 (noted previously) but the last ~20 weeks show a return to higher, more variable sales versus the deep trough in P12\u2013P16. To capture the recent regime (uptick and higher volatility) I use recent_N with N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets a base-stock reflecting the last 20 weeks' mean and volatility, balancing service (profit=holding) versus holding costs.

On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current-period demand. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 periods (stable). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the recent higher-volatility regime (balances service level vs holding cost by reflecting current demand mean/variance rather than the older low-demand regime).

Chosen L=default (promised 0, historically confirmed). mu_hat: recent_N N=20 to capture last 20 weeks of the current regime and reduce influence of the earlier high-demand period. sigma_hat: recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters lower target inventory to reduce holding cost while maintaining service for the current lower demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods across prior periods. Recent demand (roughly Periods 18-37) is materially lower than earliest high regime but has recovered versus the low spike at P12-16; to focus the forecast on the most relevant recent sales behavior I use a recent-window estimate. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the last ~20 weeks of demand volatility and mean; this keeps base_stock responsive to the recent regime while limiting noise from older high-demand weeks. This balances service (avoid stockouts with recent mean) against holding cost by sizing safety around recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting at Period 12 (noted in carry-over). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To reflect the recent low-demand regime and recent variability, use recent_N based estimates over the most recent regime. Choose N=20 (regime length since Period 12 is >20, cap 20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand and volatility while L remains default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with confirmed arrivals.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 12 (avg P1-11=90.64 vs P12-P16=33.8 and continued lower demand thereafter). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent demand stats: set L to default (promised 0); set mu_hat using recent_N to focus on the most recent regime (use N=20 to capture up-to-20 most recent weeks of the low-demand period); set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=20 to estimate volatility from recent data. This biases orders toward the lower-demand regime, reducing holding costs while maintaining service given the confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201340 arrivals same period). Demand regime shift detected starting Period 12 (user note: avg P1\u2013P11=90.64 vs P12\u2013P16=33.8, sustained). Recent demand since the regime change remains lower; to reflect the persistent lower-demand regime I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent 20 samples, capturing the post-change demand level and variability while avoiding stale high-demand observations. This keeps service while limiting holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 consistently (Periods 1\u201341 arrivals same period). A sustained demand regime shift began around Period 12 with lower average demand since then; recent 31-period regime is the relevant baseline. To capture the post-changepoint demand level and recent volatility, set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N chosen = min(regime_length,20), regime_length \u224831). This biases the forecast toward the lower, sustained demand while preserving short-run variability; given profit=holding, the backend will compute z for a 50% critical fractile and the cap will limit order sizes.

I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 (regime length >20, N capped at 20) to capture the post-changepoint lower demand and recent variability; this keeps base_stock responsive to the lower-demand regime while limiting noise from older high-demand periods. With profit=holding, service-level z*\u22480 so base_stock\u2248mu_hat; using recent data reduces excess holding from legacy high-demand weeks.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 12 (carry-over: mean dropped ~62%). Recent weekly demand (Periods 43-46): 17,10,14,17 \u2014 low and stable. On-hand=21, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historical concluded lead times confirm same-period arrivals. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed same-period arrivals). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent low-demand regime while respecting the changepoint; N=5 is chosen because the recent regime is long and recent 4 weeks show stability but rule minimum is 3 and I pick 5 to smooth one extra week. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect reduced volatility in recent periods. These parameters keep target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while preserving service for current low demand.
