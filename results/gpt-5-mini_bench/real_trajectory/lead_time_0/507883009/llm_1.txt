Recent average (last 4 weeks) \u2248160 units/week; last-3 average \u2248157 units/week. The drop to 99 on 2019-02-04 appears isolated (single-week dip) so I use ~160 as the expected weekly demand. Promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time unknown; with no in-transit or on-hand stock, order must cover current period demand (and avoid excess holding cost of $1/unit/period).
