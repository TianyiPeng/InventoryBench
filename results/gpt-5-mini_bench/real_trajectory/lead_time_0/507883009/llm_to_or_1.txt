Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean demand \u2248 153 units/week; on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals so no evidence of changed lead time or lost shipments. Promised lead time used (default). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline replenishment that balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost without overreacting to limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded history shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived same period (lead_time=0) and demand in Period 1 was 112. On-hand=75, in-transit=0. No evidence of delayed/lost shipments or a sustained demand regime shift. Use promised/default lead time to reflect observed 0-period arrival. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given stable recent demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows arrivals for Period1 and Period2 with lead_time=0; on-hand=10, in-transit=0, so no overdue shipments. Demand sample history (5 weeks) mean ~152.8 and std ~35.6. I set L by calculating observed lead times to capture confirmed same-period arrivals. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples, balancing service level (using profit/holding-driven z) against holding cost given low pipeline and current on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows lead time confirmed = 0 (orders arrive same period). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples mean \u2248152.8 and no sustained regime shift detected (samples: 124,168,190,183,99). With lead time 0, set L to default (promised 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands recent: P1=112, P2=169, P3=136, P4=123; older samples (Jan) mean=152.8. Lead time previously confirmed as 0 (orders arrived same period). I choose L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time=0. To make the forecast responsive to recent downward shift vs. Jan samples, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (uses P1\u2013P4 demands) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the latest regime and keep safety lower given holding cost >0. This balances service level (use recent demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized weekly demand has trended down from earlier historical highs (recent concluded demands: 112,169,136,123,83). On-hand = 73, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To respond to the recent downward demand regime while preserving service, I use an empirical lead-time estimate and base stock built from the most recent demand regime (last 5 weeks) so the OR engine adjusts target inventory downward and avoids excess holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded demand (P1-P6) shows weekly sales: [112,169,136,123,83,135] with no evidence of a sustained regime shift; actual lead time confirmed 0 in prior insight. On-hand=17, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=6) to focus on the most recent 6 weeks' mean and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively so the base-stock reflects current demand while keeping holding cost sensitivity via the backend's service-level mapping. This balances service with holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded orders show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 across multiple periods) and no sustained demand regime shift. Use promised/default lead time (0) and default demand estimates so OR backend uses full sample mean/variance; this keeps parameters aligned with observed same-day replenishment and stable demand history while avoiding overfitting to recent noise.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=64, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in Period 3 and every subsequent conclude). Recent demand history (Periods 1-8) is stable without a sustained regime shift. Given confirmed same-period arrivals and no clear recent demand changepoint, use the backend defaults so it computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine derive the base-stock and cap. This balances service level (use all data) against holding cost while acknowledging zero lead time and current inventory position.

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=95, in-transit=0, recent concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (orders arrived in same period across multiple past periods) and no missing shipments. Demand history sample mean=152.8/week (from provided historical samples). I set L by observed lead-times (calculate) to reflect confirmed same-period lead time, and left mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples \u2014 this balances service level (using historical mean) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=98, in-transit=0. Recent demand has declined vs earlier periods (recent demands: Periods 7-11 sold = 90,101,67,62; last 4 show a lower regime). I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) consistent with confirmed lead-time history. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest regime (captures the recent lower mean and reduced variability). This reduces over-ordering given zero in-transit stock and balances service level vs holding cost by tuning base-stock to recent lower demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Concluded history shows all observed arrivals matched orders with lead_time=0 (Periods 1-11), so use observed lead time. Recent demand (Periods 7-11 = 90,101,67,62,93) is lower than early-sample average; to be responsive I use a recent-N forecast (N=5) for mean and volatility. No evidence of lost shipments. Methods chosen: L=calculate (uses observed lead times =0); mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture current lower-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These settings focus the base-stock on near-term demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service given confirmed same-period arrivals.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent weeks show variable demand with a notable spike in Period 12 (157). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed). To target current volatility and recent demand regime, I use the last 5 concluded demand samples (Periods 8-12) for demand forecasts so the OR engine adapts to the recent lower mean but captures the recent spike. L uses promised/default (0) consistent with confirmed lead time. sigma_hat uses the same recent 5 to reflect recent variability. These choices keep orders responsive (no extra pipeline for lead time) while sizing safety stock to recent variability to balance profit vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (recorded previously). Recent history shows a stockout in Period 12 (demand=157) but otherwise weekly demand fluctuates; to let the OR engine use full-sample statistics and the confirmed lead time, I use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps parameters consistent with observed zero lead time and lets the engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Profit/holding ratio implies high service level (q=0.8). I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) since concluded history confirms it. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all available demand samples, letting the engine set the base stock and cap consistent with its demand statistics and the confirmed zero lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): on-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201315 arrivals same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history (Periods 1\u201315) shows no sustained regime change; use full-sample defaults so OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps policy responsive to full historical demand while recognizing immediate arrivals (L=0) and avoids overfitting short recent fluctuations.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent weekly demand has varied between ~62\u2013157 with historical samples provided; on-hand=55, in-transit=0. Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (observed repeatedly). No evidence of a sustained demand regime change. I choose default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses all samples and the confirmed L=0 to compute base stock that balances profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent history shows frequent same-period arrivals (lead time confirmed 0 in Period 3 and every concluded period since). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; last period demand was high (177) and ended with stockout. Use promised/default lead time (0) and default demand estimates based on all historical samples to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample mean/variance while the confirmed 0 lead time enables same-period replenishment to respond to demand spikes.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent weeks show two high-demand weeks (demand=177,201) but no sustained regime shift (fewer than 3 consecutive high-demand periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must restock to cover (1+L) periods. Previous conclude messages confirm lead time = 0 (recorded in carry-over). I choose default lead time (use promised 0) and default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine uses the full historical sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This is conservative given lack of sustained change signals and avoids overreacting to short spikes while letting the backend compute service-level-aware base stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019/06/24 (Period 20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained upward shift starting Period 17 (Period17-19 demands = 177,201,203). Baseline demand (Periods 1-16) avg \u2248105; recent avg (P17-19) \u2248193. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) consistent with confirmed lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 (use the three most recent high-demand periods) and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters increase target base-stock to serve the higher demand while limiting holding cost by using only the confirmed recent regime data.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg increased from 105 (Periods 1-16) to 193 (Periods 17-19) (+84%)

Demand has a sustained upward regime starting Period 17: recent demands (P17\u2013P20) = [177,201,203,216], recent mean \u2248199.3; I choose recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the new regime. Use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine sizes base stock to the higher post-change demand while keeping variability estimation focused on the new regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/07/08 (Period 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently (Periods 1\u201321). Demand regime shift detected at Period 17 with higher mean (Periods 17\u201321 demand elevated). I set L to default (promised 0) because observed lead time = 0 and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 17\u201321) to capture the new higher-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat; N=5 equals the current regime length (>=3). This raises the backend base-stock to better cover the sustained higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of demand. Observed lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time to keep pipeline aligned. For demand forecasting, use recent regime (Periods 17-22) to capture the higher mean and variance: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6. These parameters raise the base stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding by restricting to the recent regime rather than all historical data.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201324). Demand regime increased starting Period 17 (higher mean); recent demand (Periods 17\u201324) shows higher average but some volatility. Use L=default to trust confirmed 0 lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (Periods 17\u201324) to capture the new regime while limiting noise from older low-demand periods. This balances service level (use recent higher mean) against holding cost by relying on recent variance for sigma_hat.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 17 (~+84% vs. P1-16). On-hand=113, in-transit=0, so no incoming units expected this period. I keep promised lead time (0) since lead time has been consistently confirmed as 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=9) to focus the forecast on the elevated-demand regime (Periods 17\u201325) so the base-stock and cap reflect the new higher mean and volatility, reducing stockouts while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1/unit. Recent_N for sigma_hat uses the same window to capture current variability.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand regime is elevated since Period 17 (avg ~193 vs prior ~105). On-hand=124, in-transit=0 so current inventory covers only ~0.6 weeks of the higher-demand regime; no overdue shipments visible. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes consistently show 0, so keep L as default (promised=0). To capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (Periods 17-26) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent regime. This balances service (higher base stock to avoid stockouts in the new regime) against holding cost by using recent-regime stats rather than long-run averages.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=129, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201327), and a demand regime shift starting Period 17 (Period 20 carry-over noted). I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 17\u201327) to avoid dilution from the earlier low-demand regime: mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=11 (regime length 11 weeks, Periods 17\u201327). This biases the base-stock toward the higher recent mean and captures recent volatility, balancing higher service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=163, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed by prior concludes). Recent demand (Periods 23-28 = 164,109,123,106,96,57) averages 109.17; recent volatility (std) \u224831.9. Demand peaked earlier (Period 17+), but the last 6 weeks show a return to a lower regime; therefore use recent_N=6 to capture current demand level. L default keeps promised 0 (matches observations). These settings keep base-stock tuned to current demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/09/02 (Period 30). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (higher mean). On-hand=76, in-transit=0; no confirmed lost shipments. I set L=calculate to confirm observed lead time (history shows 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 17\u201329) to capture the new high-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Sigma uses recent_N N=13 to reflect recent volatility. This focuses replenishment on the elevated, sustained demand while avoiding overweighting older low-demand data.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/9 (Period 31). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 0 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=0). Demand regime shifted up at Period 17 (previous insight). On-hand=67, in-transit=0; given confirmed L=0 and sustained higher-demand regime since P17, I use a recent_N demand estimate based on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 17-30, 14 samples) to capture the elevated mean/volatility and avoid understocking. L set to use observed lead times. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward the higher recent mean while keeping holding cost in mind.

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand experienced a sustained regime increase around Period 17; recent demand (Periods 23-31) is variable but represents the post-shift regime, so I use recent_N=9 to capture the current mean/volatility. Profit $4 vs holding $1 implies a high service level target; keeping L=default (promised 0) and using recent demand stats balances service with holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=40, in-transit=0; recent demand has returned to ~100/week after earlier spike (Period 17-22). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in conclude history). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (most recent 5 demands: 57,87,144,125,99 -> mean \u2248102) so mu_hat reflects current demand rather than older high-volatility periods. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility.

To protect service given zero inventory and the higher-demand regime, keep promised lead time (default) and forecast using the recent high-demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime since Period 17 (regime length 17 periods) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 17 samples; this increases base-stock to meet elevated demand while letting the backend cap orders to control holding costs.

Use promised/confirmed lead time (0). For demand forecast use recent regime samples to reflect the higher mean: set mu_hat using recent_N from the post-changepoint regime (Periods 17\u201335, N=19). Match sigma_hat to the same recent window (recent_N N=19) so safety stock reflects recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend toward a base stock appropriate for the new, higher-demand regime while avoiding overreliance on older low-demand data.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=89, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently (Periods 1\u201336). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 17; to reflect the higher recent mean/volatility I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime. L kept as default (promised=0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 17\u201336), balancing service level against holding cost by sizing base stock from the recent higher mean and observed volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=76, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show actual lead time=0 (confirmed P1\u2013P37 arrivals) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (mean jump). To match the higher recent demand and keep service while avoiding excess holding, I use the promised/default lead time and base demand estimates on the most recent regime. L: keep default (promised 0). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the elevated post-Period-17 demand (use last 20 samples to reflect current mean across review+lead). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices align the OR backend with confirmed lead time=0 and the sustained higher-demand regime while balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201338 arrivals same-period), so keep promised lead time. Demand regime increased starting Period 17 (recorded previously); use recent data from that higher-demand regime to forecast. Regime length since Period 17 is 22 periods \u2192 cap N at 20 per rules; choose recent_N with N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current higher mean and volatility and balances higher service level vs holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times remain 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P39 arrivals), so use promised/default lead time. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 17; to capture the post-change demand level I use recent data. Set L=default to keep lead time=0. Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 20 demand samples (captures higher recent demand). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent variability. This balances service (higher mean and variability after the regime shift) against holding cost given q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.8 (high service target). No overdue shipments to reconcile.

I set L=default (use promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (Periods 22\u201341 provide ~20 most recent samples), so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new mean and volatility; this raises the base stock to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat increases safety stock to balance holding cost vs profit ($4 vs $1).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (many periods), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 39-42 = 98,103,65,110) shows no sustained new regime vs prior series; last confirmed regime shift (Periods 17-19) is already recorded. Given high profit vs holding (q\u22480.8) we favor service; use default population-based demand and volatility estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock with full-sample mean/std and current promised L=0. This also avoids overfitting to recent noisy weekly dips.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=124, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in Periods 1-43). A demand regime shift was previously recorded (Periods 17-19 increase). No new sustained changepoints or missing shipments observed. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, balancing service level using historical mean/variance without overfitting to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=105, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=0; no overdue shipments. There was a sustained demand regime shift up at Period 17 (already recorded) but recent weeks (Nov\u2013Dec) show a softer demand pattern vs mid-year peak. To avoid excess holding during this lower-season window while preserving service, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to bias the forecast toward the most recent 8 weekly demands (captures Nov\u2013Dec softness) so base stock shrinks appropriately and reduces holding cost exposure.

Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) shows lower weekly demand vs the mid-year spike, so I use a recent_N forecast to capture the current regime. L set to default to keep promised 0 (supported by concluded arrivals). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=5 to bias the (1+L)-period demand mean and std toward the most recent low-demand regime, reducing unnecessary holding while maintaining a high service level given profit/holding (q=0.8).

To protect service while limiting holding cost, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the recent high-demand regime. Use recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent post-shift behavior capped at 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds a base-stock reflecting the new higher mean and recent volatility.
