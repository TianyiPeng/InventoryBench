Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so promised lead time must be retained. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward shift late-Jan (samples: 41,38,65,85,137). I treat this as a new higher-demand regime beginning 2019-01-21 and use recent_N (N=3) for both demand mean and volatility to focus the forecast on the most recent stable upward periods (samples 65,85,137). L left as default (promised). Using recent_N reduces understock risk given the spike while keeping sigma_hat recent to reflect elevated variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior mean (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14)=39.5; recent mean (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04)=95.67 (+142%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-02-18. Recent demand regime increased starting 2019-01-21 (samples 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04 mean \u224895.67 vs prior mean 39.5). Current inventory on-hand=0, in-transit=0; prior Period1 order (157) arrived same-period (lead_time=0) but was fully sold, leaving stockout. I keep L as default (promised 0) since concluded history confirms 0 lead time. To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses the three higher recent samples). I set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices increase target base-stock to meet higher demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand samples show a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (recent mean \u224895.67 over 65,85,137 vs prior \u224839.5). On-hand=19, in-transit=0; prior orders (P1,P2) concluded with lead_time=0 (arrived same period), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. I set L by 'calculate' to use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (uses weeks 2019-01-21,01-28,02-04); sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices make mu_hat reflect the higher demand and keep safety stock sized to meet service while limiting holding cost given holding=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly samples show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior mean (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14)=39.5 vs recent mean (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04)=95.67 (+142%). Concluded arrivals for Periods 1\u20133 show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period). On-hand=44, in-transit=0 while recent weekly demand \u224895.7; using a recent-window demand estimate preserves responsiveness to the new, higher regime while keeping L reflecting observed 0-period lead time. I set L via calculate (use observed lead times), mu_hat via recent_N (N=3) to capture the post-changepoint mean, and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the higher recent demand while avoiding overstating variability given limited recent samples.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P4) show consistently high demand (183,197,180,210) and all observed lead times = 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so pipeline coverage is zero. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (last 4 periods) so mu_hat reflects the current high-demand regime rather than older low samples. Sigma estimated from the same recent 4 samples to capture recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet sustained higher demand while keeping holding-cost tradeoff tied to recent variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2384.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent on-hand=86, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time = 0 for all observed orders. Demand has clearly shifted higher since 2019-01-21 and recent realized weekly demands (Periods 1-5) are the best predictors. I set L to default (promised lead time 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the five most recent realized demands, which captures the new higher-demand regime while keeping estimates responsive to recent variability. This balances service (using recent higher mean) against holding cost by avoiding overly long averaging.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand is elevated and volatile versus the early-Jan baseline; concluded demands (Periods 1-6) = [183,197,180,210,130,196]. On-hand=35, in-transit=0; all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 6 concluded samples (N=6). Lead time kept at default (promised=0) since observed lead_time=0 consistently. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the current higher demand pattern, while default L keeps the (1+L) multiplier minimal to avoid excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand (Periods 3-7 = 180,210,130,196,317) shows a higher, more volatile regime versus early samples; to capture current demand level and recent volatility I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods). L uses promised/default since concluded lead time = 0. These settings raise the backend base-stock to meet elevated recent demand while sigma from recent data reflects increased variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20138) shows every order arrived in same period (arrived=... lead_time was 0 periods) so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Current on-hand=47, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history shows elevated regime since 2019-01-21 (noted previously). Given confirmed lead time=0 and limited evidence of a new changepoint beyond the documented regime shift, use default estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples. This keeps the base-stock tied to full historical mean/variance while the backend caps orders to control exposure; default L avoids overreacting to short-term noise and balances service level (profit $19) against low holding cost ($1).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=107, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time=0 (every concluded order: lead_time 0). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime (carry-over noted from Period 1). I use promised/default lead time=0 because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. To capture the post-changepoint higher demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 5\u20139: 130,196,317,273,193; mean=221.8) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*mean \u2248 221.8 and computes volatility from these same recent samples. This balances higher service level for the sustained demand increase while keeping holding costs in check since lead time is zero and on-hand is already moderate.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Observed concluded lead times = 0 for all past orders (consistent same-period arrivals). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (historic weekly demands ~180\u2013320 in recent periods). On-hand=107, in-transit=0. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N over the most recent 10 demand samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent regime; keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms lead time=0. This raises the base-stock to match the elevated demand while the sigma from recent data sets safety stock to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has settled at a higher regime since 2019-01-21; last 5 concluded period demands (P7\u2013P11) = [317,273,193,236,236], recent mean \u2248 251. On-hand=62, in-transit=0 so no incoming coverage; promised lead time historically observed = 0. I set L=default to trust promised 0 (historical concludes consistently show 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent volatility; this focuses the OR engine on short-term demand patterns and avoids diluting with older low-demand samples, improving service while limiting excess holding cost given current on-hand stock.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded messages: lead_time=0). Recent demand levels (Periods 1\u201312) are materially higher than the very early Jan samples, so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the current regime (higher mean and volatility). Keeping L as promised (default) is appropriate given repeated concluded evidence of 0 lead time. mu_hat uses a recent_N window (last 12 demand observations) to reflect the elevated demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N with the same N to capture increased variability. These choices raise the backend base-stock and cap appropriately to prioritize service (high profit/higher q=0.95) while sigma_hat captures uncertainty to avoid excessive overstock given holding cost.

Profit/holding implies high service target (q\u22480.95) so use a recent-demand estimate to capture current regime while keeping variability from same window. Choose L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent stable demand; set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=35, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 historically (every concluded message: lead_time was 0), so use promised/default lead time. No new sustained demand regime change since prior insight; demand history is volatile but stable enough to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. Using default L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat lets the backend apply its base-stock/cap rule given profit=$19 and holding=$1 and balances service level vs holding cost automatically.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 \u2014 use promised/default lead time. Demand has exhibited a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (previously recorded); to keep the forecast responsive to the post-changepoint demand level I use a recent-N estimate. Chosen N=12 (captures the most recent 12 demand observations to reflect the higher-demand regime while staying within the 3\u201320 rule). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat produces (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std over the recent regime, which raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat increases safety stock to protect service levels given profit vs holding tradeoff.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand is consistently higher than early-Jan levels (previously recorded regime shift starting 2019-01-21). All observed lead times have been 0 (orders in history arrived same period). To bias the OR engine toward recent higher demand while trusting promised lead time, I set L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent 16 samples to capture the sustained higher regime. Volatility will use default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the backend retains full historical variance information. This raises the base-stock to serve elevated demand while keeping holding cost considered by the backend.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). On-hand=78, in-transit=0; recent weekly demand has been ~200-300 units, so I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture current regime (post-2019-01-21 uplift). Chosen L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Chosen mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to reflect the latest 10 weeks of demand (captures current elevated mean/volatility) so the OR backend sets base-stock to meet service targets while limiting excess holding cost given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19). No evidence of lost shipments or new lead-time shifts.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=51, in-transit=0, recent selling rates remain well above early-Jan baseline (sustained higher demand since 2019-01-21). All observed lead times = 0, so keep L as default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (use last 8 demand samples) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting responsiveness to short noise. This biases base-stock upward to preserve service while sigma_hat via recent_N captures recent volatility; default L keeps backend assumptions aligned with observed arrivals.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent history (Periods 7\u201319) shows sustained high weekly demand (~200\u2013320, centering ~260\u2013290) and all concluded orders have arrived same-period, confirming lead time = 0. On-hand=64, in-transit=0. I set L to use observed lead times. For demand I choose recent_N to focus the forecast on the recent high-demand regime (capture weeks with similar seasonality and avoid diluting with the two low early samples). N=12 balances recency and sample size. sigma_hat uses recent_N (same N) to reflect recent volatility. These params steer the OR backend toward a higher base stock to preserve service during this sustained elevated-demand regime while keeping holding cost modest (holding cost low $1) so emphasis on service is appropriate.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders placed P1\u2013P19 all arrived same period in their conclude messages).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent weeks show the higher-demand regime established since 2019-01-21 and confirmed by many periods of elevated weekly sales; lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=115, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping responsiveness (lead time 0), I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=10) to base the reorder target on the last 10 demand observations (captures current mean and volatility while smoothing older low-demand samples). This balances service level (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost by focusing the base-stock on recent realized demand and observed variability.

To keep parameters responsive to recent higher demand, I set L to default (promised lead time = 0, consistent with observed arrivals) and use recent_N for mu_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent demand history (captures current regime). I set sigma_hat to default to let the backend compute volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost by increasing target base stock via recent mean while relying on backend volatility and cap to limit oversized orders.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). On-hand=166, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (higher mean since). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I use the promised/default lead time and estimate demand using recent data after the changepoint. I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 20 demand samples to capture the new higher-demand regime while smoothing older low-volume weeks. This keeps base_stock aligned with current demand and the low confirmed lead time minimizes pipeline adjustments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=182, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent through P1\u2013P24). A prior demand regime shift (starting 2019-01-21) is already recorded in carry-over. Given confirmed LT=0 and ample recent demand history, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full sample mean/std (1+L factor =1). This balances service level (use all data) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand position.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand (Periods 21\u201326) = [212,187,186,124,139,149], recent mean \u2248166 units/week, lower than earlier peak but well above the pre-2019-Jan regime. On-hand=81, in-transit=0 so we must cover this period's demand after decision. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default L. To reflect the recent lower post-changepoint demand, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 6 demand samples (captures current regime). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to capture current volatility (rather than long-run). These choices keep base stock responsive to the confirmed post-changepoint regime while avoiding overweighting older high-demand months, balancing service level (profit $19) against holding cost $1.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=128, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time=0 (Periods 1\u201327 arrivals matched same-period orders). Recent demand has moderated vs. earlier peaks; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 23\u201327) = [186,124,139,149,94], recent mean \u2248138.4 and recent std \u224834.9. I set L to default to use the promised lead time (confirmed by history). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk; (1+L) multiplier is applied by backend. This balances service level (captures recent demand) against holding cost given high on-hand and zero in-transit.

Recent demand (last 5 weeks: Periods 24\u201328 demands = 124, 139, 149, 94, 169) shows modest variability and an average ~135; no new sustained regime shift since earlier Jan 2019 increase. Use promised lead time (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture current short-term mean/volatility and avoid carrying excess inventory given holding cost low but nonzero.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent weekly demand has been variable after the earlier sustained shift in late Jan\u2013Feb; latest 5-week window shows lower/volatile demand (samples: P25\u2013P29 = 139,149,94,169,87). On-hand=95, in-transit=0 so pipeline is low. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To react to the most recent demand level I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the latest drop/volatility) and keep sigma_hat as default (use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These settings bias the base-stock toward recent demand while relying on overall historical variance to avoid underreacting to noise, balancing service level vs. holding cost given low pipeline.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-09-09. On-hand=153, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (carry-over). Recent demand (last months) shows a stabilized weekly mean lower than peak spring surge; to be responsive to recent pattern while letting OR backend compute service level using high profit/low holding, I keep promised lead time (default), use recent_N=20 for mu_hat to focus forecast on the latest regime, and leave sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (high profit \u2192 high fill target) with current elevated on-hand to avoid excessive new orders.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=239, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0. Demand showed a sustained upward regime from 2019-01-21 onward; recent weeks (Periods 24\u201331) show lower variability but a lower average than the early-regime peak. To balance service level (high profit $19) against holding cost ($1), I keep L at the promised (default=0) and use a recent demand estimate to reflect the current realized demand regime while avoiding overweighting older peaks. I choose mu_hat using recent_N=8 (captures the last 8 demand observations to reflect current demand level) and leave sigma_hat at default to let the backend compute volatility from full history, avoiding overfitting to short-term noise. This keeps orders responsive to current demand while limiting excess holding cost given already-high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=165, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history so use promised (default) L=0. Recent weekly demand has moderated (last five demands: 169, 87, 95, 76, 74; mean \u2248100) so I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture current lower regime and recent variability. Using recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR engine on the latest demand pattern and keeps inventory moderate given high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=78, in-transit=0; no arrivals outstanding and lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. Demand regime shift was confirmed earlier (higher mean from 2019-01-21), but recent calendar (late summer/early fall) and the last ~15 weeks show lower weekly demand (many weeks <100). I keep L=default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0. To capture the recent demand level while still respecting the confirmed regime change, I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the latest 20 weeks' demand and reduce overstock risk. These parameters prioritize lowering holding cost while maintaining service by aligning base stock to recent realized demand patterns.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=231, in-transit=0. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 to a higher mean; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To capture the post-changepoint demand level while using a robust sample, I select recent_N (N=20) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 samples (which reflect the higher regime). Keep L at default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time and there are no missing shipments. This raises the base-stock to protect service while the low holding cost ($1) limits inventory penalty.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=247, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201335) consistently show arrived=ordered in same conclude period \u2192 actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand has dropped substantially since late Aug/Sept: last 5 demands = [76,74,87,65,44] (Periods 31\u201335). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised lead time (default L=0) and forecast using the most recent short-term regime (recent_N=5) for both mean and volatility so the OR backend targets lower base stock aligned with the recent downshift.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. Recent weekly demand has moderated vs earlier-year higher regime; last 5 observed demands = [74,87,65,44,39] (avg=61.8). On-hand=208, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for short lead. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0. I set L=default to keep backend using promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to make mu_hat reflect the current lower regime (captures recent downward trend and avoids being pulled up by earlier high spring/summer weeks). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current variability. These choices keep orders conservative (avoid excess holding cost) while preserving service given current ample on-hand inventory and zero in-transit.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. On-hand=157, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent through Periods 1\u201337). No sustained new demand regime shifts since prior insight; recent weekly demand (Periods 32\u201337) is low (39\u201387) and inventory is ample. Using default L keeps promised lead time (0) which matches observed arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, letting the OR engine set a base-stock that balances high service level (q=0.95 implied by profit/holding) against holding cost given current high on-hand stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime established from 2019-01-21 (already recorded). Current inventory: on-hand=219, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. Given confirmed same-period arrivals and substantial on-hand stock (covers multiple weeks of recent demand), use the promised/default lead time to keep the OR engine behavior aligned with observed operations. Use default demand and volatility estimates (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std) so the engine incorporates all historical samples and the known regime shift already present in history. This balances service (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding aggressive extra replenishment when on-hand is ample, reducing holding cost risk.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. Recent weekly demand has settled much lower than mid-year peaks (last 5 demands = 44,39,51,76,47; mean \u2248 51.4). On-hand=247, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage vs one-week demand but holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19). Lead time history robustly confirms 0-period arrivals. I choose L=default to keep promised 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the downward regime since early autumn and avoid inflating mu_hat with high mid-year values. I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current low-volatility behavior. These settings let the OR engine target service for the current lower-demand regime while limiting excess future holding costs.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18. On-hand=175, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods) and no recent lost shipments. Recent weekly demand has been lower and more stable (~40\u201380 units) vs the early 2019 spike; to reflect the current regime I use recent data for demand moments. L: use promised/default lead time = 0 since concluded history supports 0. mu_hat: use recent_N (N=20) to capture current lower-demand regime across the latest 20 samples ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 20 weeks). sigma_hat: use recent_N (N=20) to reflect observed recent variability. These choices keep the backend base-stock high-service (q\u22480.95) but ground the forecast on the recent lower-demand regime to avoid excess holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=143, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times remain 0 (consistent with prior Period 20 insight). Recent weekly demand has moderated vs. early-2019 spike but the earlier regime shift (from Jan 2019) is already recorded. No evidence of new sustained lead-time delays or lost shipments. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps ordering aligned with the supplier's promised lead time and leverages full-sample demand stats to balance service level (profit-driven q) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory.

Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201342) consistently show actual lead time = 0; recent demand has been lower than early-2019 spike but a sustained regime shift was previously identified starting 2019-01-21. Given confirmed same-period arrivals and no new sustained demand change in the last many periods, use promised/confirmed lead time (default) and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample history so replenishment reflects long-run demand while respecting the backend cap and service/holding tradeoff.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Recent demand has moderated versus the large Jan\u2013Feb spike recorded earlier; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 39\u201343) = [47,72,48,169,56], recent mean \u224878.4. I keep L as default (promised lead time=0) since concluded history strongly supports 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility, so the OR backend will compute a base-stock tuned to current demand while avoiding excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:

Recent weekly demand in Dec (Periods 40\u201344) is lower than mid-year peaks, but the long-run demand regime shift from Jan 21 was already recorded; current low weeks include some noise (one high arrival/sale in Period 42). Given confirmed LT=0 and ample on-hand inventory, use defaults so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance (conservative, avoids overreacting to short recent dip and reduces risk of excess holding cost while service level is preserved).

Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (carry-over). To avoid excess holding cost entering the holidays while preserving service, set L to promised (default 0) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent short regime: use recent_N with N=3 (captures the recent downturn). This reduces order targets vs. full-sample averages and limits overstocking while the OR backend applies its z-service cap.
