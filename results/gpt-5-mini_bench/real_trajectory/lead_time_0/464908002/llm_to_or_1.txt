Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (early Jan 2019) show moderate demand (mean ~60). No concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change in provided history. Profit and holding cost are equal, so target service quantile q = 0.5; use default lead time and demand estimates to let the OR engine compute base stock from historical stats. This avoids overfitting to sparse data and handles potential lost shipments conservatively.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand samples (Jan weekly series) have mean ~58.4 and std ~15.6. Period 1 order (59) arrived in the same period, confirming actual lead time = 0. On-hand=27, in-transit=0; last period demand=32 (ending on-hand 27). Promised lead time=0 matches observed data, so use default lead time. Use default demand estimates based on all samples to center base-stock near historical mean (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0), and default volatility to reflect historical variability. This balances service level against equal profit/holding costs by targeting roughly one-period mean demand while capturing historical variation.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order of 59 arrived in Period 1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples mean=58.4 (5 samples). Two concluded periods (P1,P2) confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). No sustained demand regime change yet. Given confirmed L=0 and limited recent evidence of a shift, I use default estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps base_stock = historical mean and balances service level vs holding cost (profit=holding, so target service quantile ~50%).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent weekly demand rising: last 3 demands = 32, 40, 42 (mean 38). On-hand=10, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Observed lead times consistently 0 in concluded periods, so use calculated lead time. Set L via "calculate" to reflect observed lead time=0. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=3) to focus forecast on the most recent regime (captures upward shift vs earlier Jan samples). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the recent higher demand while avoiding excess holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands (Periods1-4) = [32,40,42,40], recent mean 38.5 vs historical sample mean 58.4 \u2014 sustained downward shift. Lead time observed repeatedly = 0. Set L=default (promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to capture the new lower demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead period. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility rather than historical.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean=58.4 (samples 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) \u2192 recent mean=38.5 (Periods 1-4 concluded) = -34.1% sustained over 4 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $9.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded demand shows a sustained lower regime vs historical: Periods 1-4 demands = [32,40,42,40], mean=38.5 (carry-over noted). Last period (P5) was 24 but not yet a sustained new regime. On-hand=15, in-transit=0, promised LT=0 and observed LT=0 in concluces. I set L via calculate (average observed lead times = 0). I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to target the sustained recent regime mean (1+L times mean of last 4 periods = 38.5 units demand to cover current period). I use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in that recent regime. This balances service (avoid stockouts against the recent lower demand) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical samples show a sustained demand drop vs long-run mean (carry-over note: recent regime lower); all concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. No overdue shipments. I set L by 'calculate' to reflect confirmed observed lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (captures the most recent sustained lower-demand regime across the last 4 concluded periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent4). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run variability. These choices bias the base-stock toward the new lower demand while keeping safety stock tuned to recent variance, reducing holding cost risk.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical early-sample mean(2019-01) = 58.4 but recent concluded demand shows a sustained down-shift (Periods 1-7 concluded: 32,40,42,40,24,33,38) \u2014 most recent regime (last 4 periods) avg \u2248 33.75. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To react to the sustained lower-demand regime while keeping service vs holding balanced, I use promised lead time (default) and estimate demand & volatility from the most recent 4-period regime (N=4). This keeps target stock responsive to the new lower demand and reduces holding cost risk given profit=holding. No missing shipments detected.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead demand. Historical concluded periods show lead time consistently 0 and a sustained lower-demand regime in recent weeks. I set L to promised (default=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 5-8) so mu_hat reflects the recent lower-demand regime (mean demand \u2248 34.75 over last 4 concluded periods) and sigma_hat uses the same recent sample window to capture current volatility. These choices keep orders aligned to recent demand and avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands P1..P9 = [32,40,42,38,24,33,35,44,49]. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in multiple concludes). Demand shows a past downward regime (recorded) but the most recent 5 periods (P5\u2013P9 = 24,33,35,44,49) average ~37 which better represents current variability and recent uptick. Use promised lead time (default 0) and set demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 5 samples to capture current regime and reduce sensitivity to older data. This balances service (covers immediate demand with L=0) against holding costs by avoiding overstock from older higher mean samples.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical low-demand regime (Periods 1\u20135) shifted: recent 3 concluded periods (P8\u2013P10 demands 44,49,53) show higher sustained demand. Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0. I set L to default (promised=0). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses last 3 concluded demands), ensuring base_stock and cap reflect the recent uptick while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples. This balances service (reduce stockouts given higher recent demand) against holding cost by limiting the window to the minimal sustained changepoint length.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 8 (2019-04-01): avg demand P8\u2013P10 = 48.67 vs prior recent avg (P1\u2013P4) = 38.5 (+26.4%), sustained 3 periods

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals had lead_time 0). Demand has increased since the earlier low regime: Periods 8\u201311 demands = [44,49,53,60], recent regime length = 4. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, so orders must cover this period's demand plus safety. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (mean of P8\u2013P11 = 51.5); sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to restore service given the sustained uplift while keeping volatility estimates local to the new regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover imminent demand. Observed concluded lead times are all 0 (orders placed each period have arrived same period) so set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed data. Demand has risen since earlier low regime: recent periods show a higher demand regime starting Period 8; most recent 4 concluded demands (Periods 9\u201312 = 49, 53, 60, 81) average ~60.75 \u2014 I treat this as the current regime for forecasting. With L\u22480 the review+lead horizon is 1 period, so use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the recent elevated mean and recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. This biases orders toward meeting the recent demand surge while letting the OR backend cap orders via its policy to limit excess holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (orders from P1\u2013P13 all arrived same period). Demand regime change was detected starting Period 8 (P8\u2013P10 avg=48.67 vs prior P1\u2013P4 avg=38.5) and has persisted through P13, so I use a recent-regime estimate. I set L using observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the current regime (Periods 8\u201313, 6 periods) so the OR backend targets service for the higher recent demand while limiting excess holding. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=holding=$1/unit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has increased: Periods 11\u201314 demands = [60,81,43,55], avg=59.75 over 4 periods. I set L by 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (uses the last 4 concluded demands). This raises the base_stock to match current demand and keeps safety sizing responsive while limiting excess holding given profit=holding.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg increased to 59.75 (P11\u2013P14) vs prior P8\u2013P10 avg=48.67 (+22.8%), sustained 4 periods

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed multiple concluded arrivals). Recent demand shows a higher regime vs earlier low period: last 4 concluded demands (P12\u2013P15) = [81,43,55,52], avg \u224857.75, so I use a recent_N forecast to capture this shift and tighter recent volatility. L kept as default (promised=0) because concluded history confirms 0. This balances service (raise base stock for higher recent mean) vs holding cost by relying only on recent data.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Observed lead times have repeatedly concluded as 0 (orders from Periods 1\u201316 all arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 11; I use the most recent 4 concluded demand samples (Periods 13\u201316: 43,55,52,54) to capture the current mean (~51 units) and volatility for the (1+L) review+lead window. On-hand=4, in-transit=0 so this forecast reflects current elevated demand while limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (confirmed Periods 1\u201317), so use promised/default L. Recent demand shows an upswing: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 13\u201317) = [43,55,52,54,106], mean=62.0; this captures the recent higher demand including the large spike in Period 17 while still using multiple samples to avoid overreacting to a single period. Use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the most recent regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given zero on-hand and no pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has risen sharply: Periods 15\u201318 demands = 52,54,106,139 with a recent 4-period mean = 87.75, indicating a new high-demand regime though the extreme spike is only 2 periods old. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. To meet (L+1) coverage and prioritize service given profit=holding cost, set lead time by calculation (confirms 0), and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime while keeping responsiveness to further changes. No overdue shipments to flag.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=4, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0. Demand has risen since Period 11 (sustained higher regime through Period 19); I therefore base demand forecast on the recent high-demand regime (Periods 11\u201319, 9 samples) to capture elevated demand and avoid stockouts. No overdue shipments detected. Choose L=default to trust promised 0 (confirmed historically). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=9 to set (1+L)\xd7mean over the recent high regime, and sigma_hat recent_N with N=9 to capture recent volatility; this biases orders toward service (avoiding lost sales) while the backend caps order quantity to limit excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical baseline (early 2019) had mean\u224858.4, but demand rose in later periods. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (every concluded period shows arrived same period). Recent demand regime is the last 10 concluded periods (P11\u2013P20) showing substantially higher and volatile demand (notably P17\u2013P20 spike). To capture the elevated recent mean while giving the OR engine full (1+L) coverage, I use L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 to make the forecast responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime (uses average over P11\u2013P20). I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=10 to reflect the increased variability seen in those 10 periods. This raises the base stock and the cap appropriately to balance service (avoid frequent stockouts given strong recent spikes) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg demand P17\u2013P20 = 106.75 vs prior P11\u2013P14 = 59.75 (+78.8%), sustained over 4 periods

I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime (use the last 6 concluded periods P17\u2013P22), so the OR backend will size base-stock and caps to service the elevated demand while accounting for observed volatility.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 17: last 7 concluded demands (P17\u2013P23) = [106,139,84,98,112,114,107], recent mean \u2248 107.75. On-hand=2, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Observed lead times from concluded history are consistently 0, so set L by calculating average observed lead time. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (covers the full high-demand regime length) so the backend's base-stock reflects current elevated demand while sigma_hat based on the same recent window captures current variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts in high demand) against holding cost by using a demand-driven forecast rather than the long-run low mean.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 17 (avg ~106.75 over P17\u2013P20, continued high through P24). On-hand=27, in-transit=0; with promised lead time=0 and confirmed actual lead time=0 in history, current pipeline is empty so we must replenish to meet elevated demand. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (all concluded lead_times=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 17\u201324 constitute an 8-period high-demand regime) so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of last 8 samples \u2014 this biases the base stock toward the new, higher demand. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=8 to capture volatility in the same recent high-demand window. These choices prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while letting the OR backend apply its capped ordering to limit excessive inventory given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 17 (weekly demands: P21\u2013P25 = 112,114,107,82,94; recent 5-avg ~101.8). On-hand=12, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and historical concludes confirm actual L=0 consistently. To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (the most recent 5 concluded periods) so the backend bases base_stock on the current elevated mean and volatility. L uses default (promised) since concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 and no missing shipments. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given low on-hand and zero pipeline) against holding cost by relying on a short lead time and recent-demand estimates.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=41, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead time=0 (orders from P1\u2013P26 arrived same period). Recent demand has moved to a higher regime: last 5 concluded demands (P22\u2013P26) average ~91.6 units/period vs earlier lower regimes. I use promised lead time (default L=0) given strong evidence of 0 actual lead time. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock aligned with the current elevated demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand data; default L preserves the accurate fast replenishment behavior and lets the OR engine target the appropriate service level given profit/holding parity.

Demand has been in a high regime since Period 17 (sustained elevated demand through Period 27); I therefore set lead time to promised (default) and forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime (Periods 17\u201327, regime length=11) so the OR backend builds base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead window under the current elevated mean and volatility, reducing stockouts while controlling holding given profit=holding cost parity.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show consistently observed lead time=0 and a sustained high-demand regime since Period 17 (P17\u2013P28). Recent demand has been elevated and variable (multiple weeks >60, peaks to 139). No overdue shipments. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because concluded messages consistently confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (P17\u2013P28) without over-weighting older low-demand periods; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=12 to reflect current volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent mean while keeping safety stock tied to recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (every past order arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 26\u201329 concluded: 61,60,61,71) indicates a higher sustained level vs earlier months; use a short recent window to capture current regime. On-hand=23, in-transit=0 so orders must cover this period's demand plus (1+L) review coverage. Therefore: L set by observed average lead time (calculate) = 0; mu_hat set to recent_N (N=4) to reflect the most recent demand regime; sigma_hat set to recent_N (N=4) to match recent volatility. This keeps base-stock tuned to current demand while avoiding excess safety stock given profit=holding (q=0.5) which implies modest z*.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=3, in-transit=0; historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 26\u201330) = [61,60,61,71,61], recent mean \u2248 62.8 and recent std moderate. No new sustained changepoint since recorded insights. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current higher summer demand vs earlier months (reduces bias from older low-demand samples). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (protect against stockouts given low on-hand) vs holding cost by targeting current observed demand rather than long-run average.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed arrive same period). Demand fell from the large summer peak (P17\u2013P21) to a lower, sustained regime beginning ~Period 26. I set L by calculation (observed lead times=0). For demand moments I use recent_N based on the detected regime starting Period 26: use the last 6 concluded demand samples (P26\u2013P31) to capture the new lower mean and volatility so the OR backend targets a smaller (1+L)-period forecast and tighter safety stock, reducing holding cost versus using older high-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg demand P26\u2013P31 = 59.5 vs prior P17\u2013P20 = 106.75 (-44.2%), sustained 6 periods

Recent demand regime shifted down starting Period 26 and has been sustained for 7 periods (P26\u2013P32 demand series: 61,60,61,71,61,43,38; recent mean \u224857). To reflect the confirmed 0 lead time and focus the forecast on the most recent regime, set L to default (promised = 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (captures the 7-period recent regime length per carry-over evidence). This biases the base-stock toward current lower-volatility, lower-mean demand while preserving responsiveness; no missing shipments to account for.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded periods show actual lead time = 0 repeatedly (orders placed each period arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 32\u201335 concluded: 38,56,42,52) reflects the latest regime; I use a short recent window to capture current mean/volatility and avoid overweighting older high/low swings. Set L to default (promised=0) and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sizes base stock to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while limiting holding cost risk.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time 0. Recent demand (Periods 32\u201336: 38,56,42,52,36) averages 44.8, down from prior regime avg 59.5; this is a sustained (~5 periods) downward shift. To react to the most recent regime I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to make the OR backend forecast and safety stock reflect the latest mean and variability, reducing overstock risk while preserving service. No missing shipments to reconcile.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: avg demand P32\u2013P36 = 44.8 vs prior P26\u2013P31 = 59.5 (-24.8%), sustained 5 periods

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical lead time repeatedly confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded periods). Recent demand (last 4 concluded periods P34\u2013P37 = 42,52,36,48) shows a stable short-run mean of 44.5 units. To capture the current regime while keeping responsiveness, set L to promised (default), use a recent_N demand estimate with N=4 to reflect the latest regime, and match volatility with recent_N N=4. These parameters produce (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility so the OR backend will target a base-stock aligned with current demand while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. Recent demand has been in the lower regime established at Period 32 (avg \u224845 over P32\u2013P38). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding cost, I use the promised lead time (default=0) and set demand estimates using the most recent regime (to reflect the sustained lower demand). I choose recent_N with N=7 (P32\u2013P38) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current lower-mean, lower-volatility regime and keep orders lean given minimal on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

Recent demand has moderated vs prior spikes; last 4 concluded demands = [36,48,43,29], recent mean=39. I choose L=default (promised 0, confirmed), mu_hat using recent_N N=4 to focus forecast on the latest regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 to capture recent volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has trended down: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 38-41) = [43,29,25,25], average \u224830.5, lower than earlier regimes. On-hand=12, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; (1+L) period coverage needed includes current period demand. I set L=default to use promised lead time=0. To react to the recent lower demand regime while still averaging over a few samples, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (last 4 concluded periods) so the base stock and cap reflect the current lower mean and volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical lead time repeatedly concluded as 0 periods (orders from prior periods consistently arrived same period). Recent demand has dropped over the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 39\u201343 mean \u224825), so I center the forecast on the most recent regime to avoid overstock into holiday slow week. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, reducing base-stock and holding cost exposure while preserving service for current low-demand regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders ordered and arrived same period), so set lead time to calculated/confirmed 0. Recent demand in the last 4 concluded weeks (Periods 41\u201344) is lower than mid-year peaks and appears to represent the current regime; use recent_N=4 to capture this lower short-term mean and volatility so the OR backend sizes base stock to meet near-term demand while avoiding excess holding cost. This keeps orders responsive to the current low-december demand pattern and leverages confirmed zero lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time historically confirmed as 0 (consistent arrived=ordered same period through Period 45). Recent demand has been volatile but the most recent 4 concluded periods (P42\u2013P45 demands = 38,10,15,36) better reflect current holiday-week variability than the long-run history. To keep service during this holiday week while limiting holding cost, I use a short recent window (N=4) to set demand forecast and volatility and keep lead time at default (promised 0). These parameters give the OR backend a (1+L)-period forecast based on the immediate regime and a matching short-run sigma to avoid overstocking into post-holiday weeks.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent concluded demands (Periods 43\u201346) = [10,15,36,29], recent avg = 22.5 which is modestly below the previous windows; historical concluded lead times remain consistently 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so orders must cover current period demand. I set L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because all concluded messages show lead_time=0. To react to the most recent demand level while limiting hold cost risk, I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 4 samples. This biases orders toward the recent lower demand without overreacting to single-week noise and aligns service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.
