{
  "rationale": "Lead time: confirmed = 0 (carry-over). Therefore any order placed now will arrive during Period 47 and be available for Period 47 demand. Recent demand (holiday period) is elevated: last four concluded periods demands = 73,129,137,111 \u2192 mean \u2248 112.5. On-hand = 55, in-transit = 0, so to cover one-period expected demand (~112) plus modest safety I set target supply \u2248112. Order_raw = target_supply \u2212 (on-hand + in-transit) \u2248 112 \u2212 55 = 57. OR recommended 85 (uses longer-horizon/statistics); because lead time = 0 and we have substantial on-hand already, ordering to meet one-period expected demand avoids excessive holding cost while still covering the elevated holiday demand. No lost shipments or lead-time anomalies to account for. Final action: order 57 units.",
