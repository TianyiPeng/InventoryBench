Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent history shows 4 weeks of steady modest demand (35,42,47,58) and one large spike (166 on 2019-02-04) that is not yet a sustained shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage but avoid overreacting to a single-week spike. I keep L=default (promised lead time) because no concluded arrivals to infer different lead time. For demand I use default mu_hat to let the backend use the full-sample mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) so the single spike is smoothed; sigma_hat=default to reflect full-sample variability. This balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of a regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (lead_time=0). Historical weekly samples show a recent spike (2019-02-04 demand=166 vs prior weeks 35\u201358) but only one high week\u2014insufficient to declare a sustained regime change. Promised lead time is 0 and recent evidence is consistent. To be conservative, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base-stock from the full-sample mean/variance while preserving responsiveness to the observed spike if it persists.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand has stepped up sharply (2019-02-04:166, Period1:187, Period2:138). On-hand=64, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. I treat lead time as default (promised). Demand forecast uses recent regime (last 3 high-demand samples) so set mu_hat recent_N=3 and sigma_hat recent_N=3 to capture elevated mean and volatility; this raises the base-stock to protect service level while keeping holding cost modest given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-02-04: avg increased from 45.5 (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-28) to 163.7 (2019-02-04, 2019-02-11, 2019-02-18) (+260%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand regime increased starting 2019-02-04 (carry-over). On-hand=115, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times = 0 in all past periods, so set L by averaging observed lead times. Demand has shifted recently; use the most recent 3 demand observations (Periods 1-3: 187,138,90) to capture current regime for forecast and volatility. These params bias the base-stock toward current higher-short-term demand while keeping holding cost exposure moderate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1421.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=137, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders in P1\u2013P4 arrived same period). Carry-over indicates a demand regime shift starting 2019-02-04 that persisted for three periods; recent observed weekly demand remains elevated relative to pre-shift. Promised lead time is reliable in history so use L=default. To reflect the confirmed recent higher-demand regime, set demand forecast using the most recent regime samples (recent_N with N=3) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and volatility over the latest 3 periods. This raises base-stock to preserve a high service level (profit/(profit+holding)=0.95) while avoiding overcommitment since on-hand is already substantial.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 so use promised/default lead time. A demand regime shift was recorded previously; recent realized demand has settled lower (Periods 3-5: 90,82,75). To reflect the new regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (N=3) so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, balancing service vs. holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand after the Feb spike has settled lower: last 4 observed weekly demands = 90,82,75,74 (Periods 3-6) with on-hand=21 and in-transit=0. All historical arrivals show actual lead time 0. I choose L by recent observation averaging but equal to promised (0). For demand I use recent_N over the last 4 weeks (regime appears to have shifted down and stabilized ~75\u201390) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 4). Volatility estimated from the same 4 most recent samples (sigma_hat recent_N N=4). These parameters focus the OR backend on the current lower/stable demand regime while keeping service vs holding costs balanced given low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no pipeline cover. Historical concluded arrivals show every order arrived with lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u20137), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Demand recently elevated vs Jan baseline (carry-over insight exists), and the most recent 3 weeks (Periods 5\u20137: 75,74,99) reflect the current regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to target the current demand regime and keep safety stock responsive while limiting holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1 implies a high service target, but using recent data avoids overstock from older high outliers).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in Periods 1\u20138 all arrived same period). Recent demand has settled below the early spike: last 6 concluded demands = [90,82,75,74,99,93], mean=85.5. No overdue shipments. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms 0. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent lower-demand regime (reduces overstock vs using the earlier spike). This balances service level (targets current demand variability) against holding cost given low on-hand stock.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=44, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically 0 (observed arrivals at 0 in concluded periods). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower regime (recent 5-week mean=80) so base stock reflects current demand. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings reduce overstock risk from the earlier spike while maintaining service for current demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show a sustained higher regime beginning 2019-02-04 but more recently demand has trended down (last 10 demands: 187,138,90,82,75,74,99,93,59,37). Use promised lead time (0) and focus forecast on recent periods to reflect the downward trend while still respecting the earlier regime shift. I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (captures the most recent 6-week demand pattern) so the OR backend sets base-stock responsive to current demand and reduced volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent demand (Periods 7-12 = 99,93,59,37,45,79) shows a lower regime vs early high spike; no new sustained changepoint beyond this recent pattern. On-hand=34, in-transit=0 \u2014 about half of the recent 6-period weekly mean (\u224868.7), so replenish to serve near-term demand while limiting holding cost. Choose L=default (promised 0; all concluded lead times = 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent stable regime (last 6 samples) so the OR backend sets base stock to balance the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost given current lower demand.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Observed lead times historically all 0 periods (no delayed arrivals), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has settled below the early-Feb spike; last 10 concluded periods (P4-P13) show demands = [82,75,74,99,93,59,37,45,79,58], which represents the current regime. Use recent_N (N=10) to capture this lower, more variable post-spike regime so the OR backend sizes base stock to current demand and avoids overstocking from the Feb spike.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders in each conclude arrived same period), so keep promised lead time (default). Recent demand (Periods 7\u201314) averages ~65.8 units/week and shows a lower, stable regime vs. the Feb spike; I use recent_N=8 to anchor mu_hat to the current steady run-rate and recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These parameters keep base_stock aligned with recent demand (reducing excess holding cost) while preserving service given current lead time and no pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=11, in-transit=0; recent history (Periods 8-15) shows stabilized demand lower than early Feb spike. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so keep promised lead time. To avoid overstock given profit=$19 vs holding=$1, use recent_N (last 8 periods) to capture the current post-shift demand regime for both mean and volatility; this keeps base-stock responsive to the lower, more stable demand while limiting holding cost exposure.

Demand history (P1\u2013P16) mean=81.875, std\u224836.51. No new sustained changepoint since the earlier Feb shift; recent weeks fluctuate around the long-run mean. Use promised/observed lead time (default=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/std to balance service level vs holding cost given steady but variable demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=110, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time=0 (all past orders arrived same period). Recent demand (last 5 periods: 58,56,92,46,37) is lower than earlier spikes; no new sustained regime shift detected. Use L=default to trust promised lead time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime (reduces excess holding while maintaining service). This yields (1+L)-period demand estimates based on the last 5 weeks, which helps the OR backend lower base-stock and cap orders given current ample on-hand inventory.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. Recent demand (Periods 13-18) averages moderate levels with no new sustained regime change since the Feb spike; all observed lead times = 0 and no overdue/lost shipments. On-hand=67, in-transit=0 so pipeline covered only current period; using default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates lets backend compute base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This is conservative given lack of sustained recent shift and avoids overreacting to the short Feb spike.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=111, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in every observed period (no delays), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 11\u201319) appears to represent the current regime (demands: 45,79,58,56,92,46,37,43,32); I choose recent_N with N=9 to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the most recent sustained sample window and to capture current mean while limiting influence from the early Feb spike. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders aligned to observed lead time and recent demand, balancing service (using recent mean) versus holding cost by avoiding inflation from the Feb spike.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. Current on-hand=96, in-transit=0. Recent demand has declined from the Feb spike; last 7 demands (Periods 14-20) = [56,92,46,37,43,32,15], showing a downshift vs earlier high-volatility period. Promised lead time used (default=0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the current lower-demand regime while retaining enough samples for stable estimates; this keeps base-stock responsive to the recent fall in demand and limits excess holding given low holding cost but high service level (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Demand shows a prior spring spike (recorded) but the recent regime (summer) is lower and more variable; use recent_N to capture the current summer demand pattern. I select N=6 (last 6 demand observations: P19-P24) to reflect the most recent regime length and variability so the OR backend will size base stock to current demand rather than the earlier spike.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0; no overdue shipments. Earlier carry-over noted a demand regime shift in Feb 2019, but recent weeks (Periods 18-25) show a lower, stable demand pattern. I use L=default (promised 0). For demand I apply recent_N using the last 8 periods (P18\u2013P25) to capture the current regime: recent mean \u224835 units/week, so mu_hat=(1+L)*mean targets ~35. I set sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent variability. These parameters keep safety stock aligned to the current lower-demand regime, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. Recent weekly demand (last 10 periods) averages ~44.6 units with noticeable volatility; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Historical conclude messages show orders consistently arriving same period (observed lead_time=0 across many periods) so use promised lead time. To be responsive to current demand regime (post-Feb shift and recent stable lower mean), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent 10 samples to reflect current mean and volatility and avoid overweighting early 2019 spike. This balances service level (use recent mean for base stock) against holding cost (avoid inflated forecast from old spike).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (no evidence of delays or losses). A demand regime shift was previously recorded (Feb spike) but recent weeks (May\u2013Aug) show moderate, variable weekly demand without a new sustained shift. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and full-sample demand history, use default lead time and default demand statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using full historical mean/variance) against holding cost given low current pipeline and modest on-hand inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent weekly demand (Periods 24-29) = [33,50,82,84,67,47], mean \u2248 60; on-hand=84, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Historical lead times observed consistently 0 in concluded history, so keep L at promised (default). To keep responsiveness to the recent mid-summer demand pattern while avoiding overweighting distant Feb regime shifts, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (uses the last 6 demand samples). This produces a demand forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean \u2248 60 and volatility based on recent variability, which balances service (avoid stockouts given current on-hand=84) against holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all arrived same period ordered), so I use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Recent demand since late July/August shows a new operating level (higher weekly variability and several stockouts); I therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window to capture the current regime. I choose N=8 (last 8 demand observations: Periods 23\u201330) to balance recency and sample size; this lets the OR engine target service given profit=$19 and holding=$1 while reflecting recent volatility and demand level.

LLM Rationale:

No new sustained demand regime change since the previously recorded Feb shift; recent weeks (Periods 22\u201331) show higher and variable weekly demand, so use a recent-window forecast to capture current mean/variability. Choose recent_N with N=10 to weight the last ~10 weeks of observed demand (captures summer/autumn pattern) so the OR backend sets base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while reflecting recent volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=30, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected this period. Promised lead time=0 and historical conclude messages consistently show 0, so use default promised L. To reflect the recent higher-demand regime and current on-hand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=7 (captures the most recent 7 weeks including recent spikes) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet current demand while sigma from same window captures volatility and prevents excess overstock given low holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently; recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P30-P34) = [87,110,78,152,96], mean=104.6, showing elevated and volatile weekly demand vs early-year baseline. Profit/holding => high target service level (q\u22480.95). To reflect the recent higher demand regime and capture recent volatility, I set L=default (promised 0, confirmed by concluded history) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (captures the latest demand regime and keeps responsiveness). This balances service (raise base stock to meet current weekly demand) while limiting excess holding by using only the recent 5 weeks rather than all historical data.

No new sustained lead-time signals; promised lead time remains appropriate. To match the recent demand regime and high profit-to-hold ratio (q\u22480.95) I use recent_N=8 to base mu_hat on the last 8 observed demands and recent_N=8 for sigma_hat so the OR engine targets high service while reflecting current volatility.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. Recent demand (Periods 31-37) = [110,78,152,96,78,71,64], recent mean ~92 with noticeable spike (152) but otherwise lower; on-hand=78, in-transit=0. No new sustained demand regime or lead-time change detected. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level and volatility including the recent spike while keeping responsiveness to current trend. This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to current demand without over-committing inventory given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand history (Periods 1\u201338) shows variability but no new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded Feb spike. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes base-stock from all samples. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while respecting holding cost (low $1/unit) vs. profit ($19/unit).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods \u2192 keep promised lead time. Recent demand (most recent 6 concluded weeks excluding an isolated spike at Period 33) = [96,78,71,64,82,56], mean \u2248 74.5; demand appears stable at ~75 units/week. I choose L=default to match observed 0 lead time, mu_hat recent_N (N=6) to anchor forecast to the latest stable weeks and avoid dilution from earlier seasonality/spikes, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters balance service (cover ~75 units this review+lead) against holding cost given current on-hand of 77 and no pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows variability but no new sustained regime change since prior insight (Feb shift already recorded). To let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics and balance service level vs holding cost, select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples). This avoids overfitting to short-term fluctuations while L=default keeps ordering aligned with observed zero lead time.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 so use promised lead time (default). Recent weekly demand appears stable through autumn; use a recent window to capture current regime. I choose recent_N N=12 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (roughly last 3 months of data) so the backend bases base-stock on current mean/volatility. This balances service (profit $19) vs holding cost ($1) by letting OR compute z from profit/(profit+holding) while using up-to-date demand stats. No evidence of lost shipments or new lead-time changes.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent history (Periods 1\u201342) shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and no sustained new lead-time anomalies; demand has varied but no new changepoint after the previously recorded Feb 2019 regime shift. On-hand=62, in-transit=0 \u2014 with promised L=0 arrivals occur same period, but arrivals will only be visible in next period's conclude. I therefore keep L at default (promised lead time=0) and use default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std using all samples. This balances service level (using full historical mean/variance) against holding cost given current moderate on-hand inventory and no evidence of lost shipments.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Recent 12-week demand (Periods 32\u201343) average \u224875 units/week with std \u224826.9; no recent lead-time deviations \u2014 all concluded lead_times=0. To avoid overreacting to early-2019 spike and capture current seasonality, I use recent_N (N=12) demand estimates so base_stock reflects current demand. L kept default (promised 0). This keeps pipeline = (1+L)*mean \u224875, limiting holding cost while maintaining service for one-period demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (last 8 periods) around early Nov\u2013Dec is lower than earlier 2019 spikes; to reflect the current regime and avoid excess holding in holiday season, I use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock to recent demand patterns while the default L keeps fast replenishment.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent weeks show elevated and volatile demand (Period 41-45 demands = 52,66,45,99,106) suggesting a near-term higher demand regime vs longer-run average. All concluded lead times = 0 (no evidence of delays). To respond to current high recent demand while limiting holding cost, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime (mean of last 5 weeks \u224873.6 units) so base-stock reflects current demand spike. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility and set safety stock appropriately. This balances service level (respond to recent spikes) against holding cost given no pipeline inventory.

LLM Rationale:

Demand history shows a past sustained regime shift in Feb but no new sustained change recently; recent weeks include holiday volatility but not a clear new regime. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and full-sample demand statistics, I use default lead time and default demand moments so the engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This balances service (using all historical demand including past spikes) against holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory and no pipeline.
