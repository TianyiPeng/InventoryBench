  "rationale": "World/calendar: Date is 2019-02-11, just before Valentine\u2019s Day (Feb 14) when apparel, especially women's fashion, can see modest short-term uplift. Product: ladies denim jeggings \u2014 seasonally neutral but can be promoted around holidays/specials. Historical demand: recent weekly series shows a rising pattern with a large spike on 2019-02-04 (35,42,47,58,166). The spike on 2019-02-04 is a single large outlier (one period) without multiple-period confirmation, so it is not yet a sustained regime shift. Lead time & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0; supplier promised LT=0 but actual LT is unknown \u2013 treat as possibly >=0 and therefore ensure coverage for at least the current period (and a short safety buffer). Forecast & decision logic: target service for current week plus a conservative safety buffer to protect against short LT or a repeat of the recent spike given upcoming Valentine\u2019s interest. Holding cost is low ($1/unit) vs profit $19/unit, so stocking a moderate buffer is profitable if sold. Order chosen = 120 units to cover a plausible high-week demand (covers spike risk) while limiting excess if spike was isolated.",
