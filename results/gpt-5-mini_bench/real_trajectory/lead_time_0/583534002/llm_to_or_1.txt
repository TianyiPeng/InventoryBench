Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand shows a recent downward regime: last 3 weeks = 219, 181, 125. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected. Promised lead time is 0 and no observed lead-time data exists, so keep L as default. To react to the clear recent downward shift (3-period regime), set demand forecast using the most recent 3 samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower recent mean and reduced volatility. This tightens orders to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service for near-term demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting early Jan 2019: avg of all samples=221 (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) vs recent 3-week avg=175 (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04), decrease -20.8%

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent conclude shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (arrived=215, lead_time observed=0). On-hand=92, in-transit=0; one-period demand will occur after decision so (1+L) coverage matters. No sustained new demand or lead-time shifts beyond the previously recorded Jan demand dip. Use promised/default lead time (0) and default demand/volatility estimates based on full sample history to let the OR backend compute base_stock and caps from the full-sample mean (221) and std. This balances service level (profit=$4 vs holding=$1) using the backend's q formula while avoiding overreacting to short recent fluctuations.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=116, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands (P1=123, P2=165) and historical Jan samples show a downward shift versus earlier sample mean (221 \u2192 recent average ~175). Lead times observed in concluded messages are 0 periods (P1 and P2), so use calculated average lead time. To react to the recent lower demand while still smoothing with prior weeks, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to focus the forecast on the most recent regime; keep sigma_hat default to retain overall historical volatility for safety. These choices reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding given falling demand and leverage observed lead time=0 so orders can arrive same period.

Daily Reward (R_t): $202.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded demands (Period1-3 sold = 123,165,82) are well below historical sample mean (221), indicating a sustained lower-demand regime. On-hand=126, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time observed consistently as 0 in concluded history, so set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new lower regime ((123,165,82) \u2192 recent mean \u2248123.3) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean. Volatility should reflect recent variability, so sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3). These choices reduce target base stock to avoid excess holding given lower realized demand while matching confirmed same-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand shows a lower regime vs full-sample (recent 3-week avg ~175 vs all-sample mean 221). On-hand=108, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been confirmed at 0 in prior periods. To reflect the recent lower demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility so the (1+L)-period forecast uses the most recent 3 weeks. Keeping L as default (promised=0) matches observed fast arrivals and avoids inflating pipeline. This balances service (using recent demand to set base stock) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean=221 (samples 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04); observed lead times in concluded periods are consistently 0. No sustained new demand or lead-time shift in the last 3+ periods that would justify changing defaults. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend assumes same-period arrivals. Use default demand and volatility (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to let the backend compute base-stock and cap; this balances service (using full-sample demand) against holding cost given low current inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=91, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed). Recent demand has softened versus earlier Jan spikes but signal is short; to avoid overreacting to short-term noise I use default estimates based on the full historical sample (stable long-run mean/variance) and the promised lead time of 0. This gives the OR engine a (1+L)\xd7mean demand anchor and full-sample volatility so base-stock orders balance a high service level (profit/holding ratio \u2192 q=0.8) against holding cost while respecting the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean (provided dataset) = 221; recent periods show variability but no new sustained regime change since last recorded insights. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and the canonical historical sample statistics, I set L=default (use promised 0), mu_hat=default (uses (1+L)*mean of all samples = 221), and sigma_hat=default (uses sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples). This favors maintaining service (high q given profit/holding) while avoiding overreacting to short recent demand swings or transient variability; any sustained shift will be recorded when confirmed.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=145, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across many periods so use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time. Recent demand (Periods 4-8: 51,146,151,187,90) is volatile and shows a regime change since early Jan; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand pattern. This keeps (1+L)\xd7mean responsive to current demand while sigma based on recent variability balances service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent concluded demands (P1\u2013P9) average ~117 units/week with volatile weeks (range 51\u2013187). On-hand=112, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments observed; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To balance high service level (q\u22480.8 given profit=$4 / (4+1)) against holding cost, use default estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full-sample mean/variance and promised lead time (0). This keeps ordering responsive to observed variability while respecting verified zero lead time.

Recent demand has shifted down (~-21% vs earlier average); to adapt I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=3 weeks) so mu_hat reflects the lower recent demand and reduces excess holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1. sigma_hat also set to recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. (1+L)=1 coverage used by backend.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=116, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen and stabilized over the last 5 conclude periods (Periods 8-12: 90,59,44,34,33 \u2192 mean=52). Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 0. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised lead time and base-stock inputs driven by the most recent 5-period demand stats.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=81, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 and recent weekly demand has been low (~33\u201335 units) after earlier Jan regime shift. Profit/holding implies high target service level (q=0.8). I will use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample statistics (conservative given stable recent demand) and avoids over-ordering given holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=184, in-transit=0. Recent realized weekly demand has fallen sharply (Periods 12-14: 33, 35, 18 \u2014 3-period mean \u2248 28.7) versus earlier weeks; no overdue shipments and historical lead time confirmed as 0. To avoid excess holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1, use the promised lead time (0) and set demand estimates based on the most recent low-demand regime (last 3 weeks) so the OR backend targets lower base-stock and reduces overstock risk.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=161, in-transit=0. No overdue shipments. Historical concludes show stable same-period arrivals (lead time=0). Demand has shifted down since early Jan; recent 5-week demand (Periods 11-15) is low (~34,33,35,18,23). Set L to observed-average to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): recent demand has fallen to ~20\u201335 units/week; current on-hand=146 with in-transit=0 (ample cover). Historical conclude messages confirm lead time = 0. To avoid excess inventory while reflecting the new low-demand regime, set L to promised (default=0) and forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 12\u201316) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lowered mean and volatility. This reduces new orders given abundant on-hand while keeping service given high profit/holding ratio.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=126, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (seed) mean=221, recent history shows lower demand but not a 3+ period sustained regime change. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded periods. Profit=$4, Holding=$1 (service quantile q=0.8). I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples)=221 and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps target base-stock anchored to the long-run sample mean while leveraging confirmed L=0 and avoids overreacting to short recent dips given ample on-hand inventory (126) and zero pipeline.

Lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set L based on observed lead times and forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current low-demand regime. sigma also estimated from the same recent window to reflect current variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand 168, in-transit 0. Recent weeks show a sustained lower-demand regime (recent demands P14\u2013P19 = [18,23,15,20,11,5], avg \u224815.3) versus the earlier sample mean (\u2248221). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0. To align the base-stock to recent demand and avoid over-ordering while maintaining a high service target (q=0.8), set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (6 most recent concluded periods). This keeps the forecast and volatility tied to the observed recent demand pattern and mitigates unnecessary inventory holding given substantial on-hand stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=163, in-transit=0. Historical Jan samples mean=221 but recent realized weekly demand has fallen sharply (Periods 16-20 demands = 15,20,11,5,5). Lead time previously confirmed as 0. To avoid overstock while meeting current low demand, set L=default (use promised 0). Use recent_N for demand to reflect the new low-demand regime: mu_hat based on last 5 weeks (captures current demand ~11 units/week \xd7 (1+L)). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect current low volatility. This reduces ordering to match observed low sales and lowers holding costs given high on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical sample mean=221 (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) vs recent 5-week avg=11.2 (Periods 16-20: 2019-05-27 to 2019-06-24), decrease \u224895%; lead time confirmed as 0 periods.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid heavy overstocking given the sustained low-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 periods where the new low-demand regime is evident. This tightens orders to current demand and reduces holding cost exposure.

Recent demand has remained at the low regime identified earlier (Periods 16-22 avg \u224811.2 units/week); on-hand=143, in-transit=0 so inventory is ample vs current low demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid overstock while meeting low demand, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the new low regime (N=5, matching the 5-week recent avg used in prior detection). Use recent_N for sigma to capture current low-volatility regime. These choices align base-stock with the low recent mean and reduce needless holding cost given large on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Lead-time history shows consistent same-period arrivals; use promised/default lead time. To avoid overstock given low demand and positive holding cost, set demand forecast using recent data: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-mean, low-volatility regime so the OR base-stock is reduced accordingly.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has settled at a low regime (last 5 demands: 5,15,11,2,8; mean=8.2/week). On-hand=122, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. To keep service while minimizing holding: set L to calculated average of observed lead times (0). Forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the new low-demand regime (reduces order quantities and holding).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has settled at a low regime since Period 21: last 5 demands = [15,11,2,8,4], mean=8 units/week. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0. On-hand=118 (ample vs ~8*(1+L)), so I prefer conservative forecast using the recent 5-week regime to avoid excess holding cost. Set L to the observed average lead time, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained low-demand regime and low volatility.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been much lower since Period 21 (avg \u224811.2/week across Periods 16-20 and sustained low weekly sales P21-P27). On-hand=105, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time historically confirmed as 0. To avoid overstocking given high holding cost relative to profit, I forecast using the recent low-demand regime (use last 7 weeks) and match volatility to that window. This keeps target base-stock small while protecting service for the sustained low-demand period.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=100, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand is very low (last 5 weeks: 2,8,4,13,5; mean=6.4) and lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep promised lead time and base demand forecast on the most recent low-demand regime. Chosen: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat recent_N using last 5 samples to capture current low mean; sigma_hat recent_N using last 5 samples to capture current low volatility. This reduces ordering to match the low-demand regime and prevents overstock.

Historical concluded lead times are 0 periods consistently. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting low demand, I use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current low-demand regime and reduced volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent demand has been at a much lower regime since late May (Periods 16\u201330 showing weekly demand ~5\u201315 vs historical Jan mean ~221). On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, and recent demand regime is sustained (15+ periods of low demand). I set L by calculating observed lead times (will confirm 0). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use the most recent 5 weeks to capture the new low-demand regime and avoid ordering to cover the old high mean, reducing holding cost while maintaining service. This prioritizes profit per unit versus holding cost given current low demand and zero pipeline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent demand has settled at a low regime (~single-digit weekly sales) and actual lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. On-hand=80, in-transit=0 so we currently have ample stock vs expected weekly demand. To reflect the confirmed short lead time and the recent low-demand regime, use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 weeks (periods 27-31) where demand = [13,5,4,8,8] (mean=7.6) to keep replenishment conservative and avoid overstock while meeting high service target (q=0.8). Recent_N for sigma captures observed low volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand is in a low regime since late May (Periods 16-32), with weekly demand mostly single- to low-double digits and current on-hand=73, in-transit=0. Lead-time history shows consistent 0-period arrivals in concluded messages. To match the sustained low-demand regime while keeping safety stock for service, set L to promised (default = 0). Use recent_N for demand estimates to reflect the new low-demand regime (use the last 17 periods, Periods 16\u201332) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base stock and cap from the low recent mean and volatility rather than the older high-demand weeks. This reduces overordering and holding cost while preserving service level given profit/holding ratio.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Lead time repeatedly observed as 0. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time=0. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 16\u201333, length 18) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current low mean/volatility; N=18. This keeps orders small to avoid holding cost while meeting the low recent demand and leverages confirmed L=0 to allow same-period replenishment if needed.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. Recent observed demand has been low and stable (Periods 30-34 demands = 8,8,7,6,5; recent 5-week mean ~6.8) and on-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical early-2019 mean (\u2248221) is no longer representative. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 0 periods. I choose L=default to honor the promised lead time (0) and keep model aligned with confirmed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (uses last 5 weeks). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect current low-variance demand. These settings steer the OR engine to a much lower base-stock appropriate for current demand, reducing overstock and holding cost while preserving service given low demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (~8,8,7,6,5,5 for Periods 30-35 \u2192 avg \u22486.5), and historical concluded messages confirm lead time = 0. On-hand=57, in-transit=0 so current inventory covers multiple weeks of this low-demand regime. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time=0). To capture the current low-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=6 (uses the last 6 weeks to reflect the sustained low mean). I also use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=6 to reflect the reduced volatility in recent weeks. These choices reduce order quantities vs longer historical averages, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

Date 2019-10-28. Recent demand has been low and stable (last 5 demands: 6,5,5,4,16) and there are no in-transit units; historical concluded lead times consistently 0. On-hand=37 covers several weeks of current low demand; no overdue arrivals. Set L to default (promised lead time 0) because concluded history confirms 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and recent variance so the OR backend sizes base-stock to avoid excess holding while preserving service.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 16 (weekly demand mostly 2-20), so using recent samples will avoid overstock driven by the high-Jan2019 historical mean. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 0 (confirmed earlier), so keep promised lead time. Set L=default to use promised 0. For demand, use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (regime length ~23 periods from P16\u2013P38; cap at 20). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base stock and cap small to preserve profit while minimizing holding cost given current on-hand=33 and zero in-transit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been in the low regime confirmed since Period 21 (recent 5-week avg \u22487.8 units/week). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods. On-hand=23, in-transit=0 covers ~3 weeks at recent demand; to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I use a short-term recent demand estimate (N=5) and keep L at promised (default=0). Methods chosen: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat recent_N N=5 to capture current low regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 21 (periods 21\u201340, 20 weeks) with mean demand ~5\u201310/week versus earlier higher winter mean; lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To avoid overstocking given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (regime length = 20 weeks) so the OR backend targets base stock appropriate for the recent low-demand regime and lower volatility, reducing holding costs while preserving service for the observed demand level.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in the low regime since ~Period 16 (sustained low weekly sales). No new lead-time issues observed (historical lead time confirmed 0). To avoid overstock while covering (1+L) review+lead period, keep promised lead time default (0) and base demand estimates on the most recent sustained low-demand regime. Use recent_N=20 to capture the last 20 weeks (Periods 22\u201341 approx.) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock appropriate for the low-sale regime and limits holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Historical weekly samples (early 2019) had mean ~221 but a sustained regime shift to very low demand began around Period 16\u201321 and persisted through Period 42 (weekly demands now ~1\u201316). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 0 periods. Given on-hand=9, in-transit=0 and the low recent demand, I use a short recent-window forecast to capture current low-demand regime while keeping lead time at promised 0. Chosen methods: L=default to respect confirmed 0 lead time; mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 weeks (captures current low average ~5.6/week); sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent variability. These parameters reduce overstock risk while maintaining service given profit/holding tradeoff (q=0.8).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical and conclude messages show confirmed lead time = 0 and a sustained low-demand regime since mid-2019 (large drop from early-2019 levels). No evidence of lost shipments. To keep service with minimal holding cost, use a short lookback focusing on recent low demand: infer L from observed lead times, and set demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 5 weeks to reflect current low-sales regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 16\u201321 (weekly demand mostly single- to low-double digits) and lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods. On-hand=7, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime while letting the OR engine compute pipeline-sensitive base stock, I keep L as promised (default=0) and use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 weeks (captures the low-demand regime while smoothing short noise). This reduces excess holding risk while preserving service for current low-rate demand given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent observed demand is very low (weekly demands in Dec: P41-45 = 2,11,5,3,2). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0 in history. I choose L=default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (mean \u22484.6 units/week) and reduced volatility; with on-hand=8 and in-transit=0 that covers roughly two weeks of expected demand, avoiding excess holding cost during a low-demand season while maintaining service.

Lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history. To keep service high given Profit=4 vs Holding=1 (high target fill rate) but reflect the recent low-demand regime, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0), and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the most recent low-demand regime (captures current low demand and reduced variability), avoiding overstock while preserving service level.
