======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: concluded history shows lead time = 0 (orders historically arrive same period), so no pipeline delay to cover. Inventory: on-hand = 7, in-transit = 0. Demand outlook: recent sustained collapse \u2014 extended low-demand regime confirmed in carry-over insights (Periods 29\u201342 avg \u2248 8.5/week and many single-digit weeks most recently; last 5 periods demand = 15,2,2,5,1 then 1 in Period 46). OR's recommendation (107) uses long-run history and promised lead time and would produce large holding cost relative to expected sales. Economics: profit = $4, holding = $1 \u2192 critical fractile favors stock but only if demand justifies it; current observed demand is far below historical. Decision: place no order this period to avoid holding cost while preserving cash; with lead time 0 we can reorder next period if demand picks up. Monitor next few periods and resume ordering only if sustained demand increase (\u2265 ~15/week) is observed.",
