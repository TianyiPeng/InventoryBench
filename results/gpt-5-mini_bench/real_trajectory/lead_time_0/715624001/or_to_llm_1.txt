Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Promised LT=0 and concluded history shows numerous orders arriving same period (many Period X conclude entries: ordered and arrived in same Period X), so actual lead time = 0. Inventory & demand analysis: On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand is very high (Period 45 demand=233, Period 46 demand=214; earlier weeks lower but last two periods show a clear short-term spike). Profit=19 and holding=1 imply a high critical fractile (q=19/20=0.95) so we tolerate holding to avoid stockouts. OR recommends 171 but that would leave total available = 46+171 = 217, barely covering a single ~214-week spike with no buffer. Because LT=0, an order placed now will arrive in-period and protect sales this period. Strategy: increase OR's recommendation to 260 units to cover expected demand around 220\u2013240 plus safety stock for next period, accepting modest holding cost given high unit profit and recent volatility. This reduces short-term stockout risk during the holiday/high-demand weeks.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Actual lead time confirmed 0 and recent demand spiked (233, 214); increased OR's 171\u2192260 to cover current high-week demand plus safety stock given high profit/low holding cost.",
