Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; use promised lead time. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u224854.2 units/week and moderate variability. Set L to default (promised), mu_hat default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, and sigma_hat default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps forecasting conservative given limited history and no evidence of lead-time shifts or regime changes.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent concluded history shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in-period (arrived=108, lead_time=0). On-hand=17, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean ~54 and high variability (two recent 85s). Promised lead time is 0 and the single observed arrival matches that, so use default lead time to keep policy aligned with promise. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples) to balance service level vs holding cost given limited history and recent high-but-not-sustained spikes. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the environment accumulates more arrival/demand evidence.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 for Periods 1\u20132 (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand samples: 59,14,28,85,85 (mean ~54.2). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead time (0). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service vs holding cost given stable short lead time and modest recent demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2094.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/03/04. Recent concluded periods (P1-P3) show demand = 91, 110, 111 (avg ~104) and all three orders arrived with lead_time=0 \u2014 actual lead time confirmed as promised. On-hand=15, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low vs recent weekly demand (~104). I therefore keep L as default (promised=0). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses the three most recent demand samples). To reflect current volatility I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3. These parameters prioritize service (raise base-stock to match the new mean) while sigma based on recent variability avoids underestimating risk; using default L preserves correct timing given confirmed 0 lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (dates 2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25): avg demand increased from ~54 (Jan samples) to ~104 (Periods 1-3), +92%, sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1137.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 1: Periods 1-3 averaged ~104 units/week (higher than Jan baseline) and Period 4 dipped to 63. On-hand=60, in-transit=0 so no incoming cover. Lead times observed in concluded history are consistently 0 periods; use observed average to confirm. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 concluded demand samples (Periods 1-3) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand from the elevated regime rather than the older Jan baseline. This helps raise target base-stock to avoid stockouts while sigma from the same recent window captures current volatility. Using calculated L (observed average) keeps lead-time assumptions aligned with concluded arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1700.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-5) shows arrivals with observed lead_time=0 consistently; demand samples: [91,110,111,63,92]. On-hand=48, in-transit=0, so available inventory covers ~0.5\u20131 periods of recent demand. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to confirm lead_time=0. Demand shows a sustained higher regime earlier (Period1\u20133) but some decay in Period4; to keep responsiveness to recent fluctuations while retaining stability I use recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the last 3 demand samples). This biases the backend forecast toward recent realized demand and keeps safety stock aligned to short lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime increase starting Period 1 (Periods 1-3 avg ~104) and continued high weekly demands (P1..P6 = 91,110,111,63,92,109). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 \u2192 use default promised L. To capture the new higher-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 6 concluded samples (Periods 1-6) so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given strong recent demand while sigma_hat from recent data controls safety stock to limit holding cost given on-hand=20 and no in-transit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show all observed lead times = 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period) so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand since Period 1 shows a sustained higher-demand regime; use recent_N over the last 7 demand samples (Periods 1\u20137) to capture the post-change mean and volatility. This raises mu_hat to match the new regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability. These choices prioritize service (higher base stock) given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent realized demand has risen vs. Jan baseline (historic carry-over: sustained higher regime starting P1). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for (1+L) periods. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use calculated average. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 8 concluded demand observations (P1\u2013P8) so the OR engine targets a base-stock fitting current demand and measured volatility, balancing $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 each period (orders from P1\u2013P9 arrived same period). Demand has been elevated and variable across recent weeks (multiple demands >100 and an April spike of 149). I use promised/default lead time=0 since concluded history confirms it. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent regime (sustained higher demand over the last 8 periods) so \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 reflect current higher mean and volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand 83, in-transit 0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P10 all arrived same period). Demand has been elevated and volatile since Period 1 (carry-over insight already recorded). I keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded data consistently supports same-period arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and volatility (focus on latest 5 concluded demands to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability). This biases base-stock toward current higher mean while letting sigma reflect recent variation, balancing service level (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) against holding cost and zero observed transit delays. No evidence of lost shipments to adjust L explicitly.

Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised/default L. Recent demand shows a higher, sustained regime vs Jan; to capture current mean and volatility I use the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 8-12: demands 149,87,65,116,119) for mu and sigma estimates. This balances service (captures recent elevated mean ~107) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand has been elevated and somewhat variable; to reflect the latest regime while limiting sensitivity to single-week noise, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent 5 demand observations). This balances service (higher mu_hat) versus holding cost given current on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arriving same period), so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand shows higher levels in latest weeks (Periods 10-14: 65,116,119,119,171) indicating an upward shift; to be responsive I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime while avoiding overreacting to a single spike. Demand volatility should reflect the same recent window, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service when stockouts occurred (Period 14) while using recent sample variability to limit excess holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand is volatile but elevated vs Jan baseline; on-hand=43, in-transit=0 so no incoming coverage. All observed lead times historically = 0, so keep promised lead time. To focus the forecast on the most relevant recent behavior (captures the large spikes in Apr\u2013May), use recent_N for demand and volatility using the last 8 demand periods (Periods 8\u201315). This yields mu_hat that targets (1+L)\xd7mean of recent demand and sigma_hat that reflects recent std; with L=0 the OR backend will size base stock to recent demand while limiting holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=16, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments; historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Demand has been elevated and volatile since Period 1 (carry-over insight). To keep service high while avoiding excessive holding given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19), I keep promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on recent demand to capture the sustained higher regime. I select recent_N with N=9 (uses last 9 demand observations) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the current elevated mean and volatility while smoothing short spikes. This balances higher target base-stock for service with controlled inventory given observed variability.

Historical concluded arrivals show every order (Periods 1\u201317) had lead_time=0; demand has been elevated and variable since Period 1 (sustained higher regime recorded previously). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed operations, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Historical conclude messages consistently show arrived orders with lead_time=0 for all observed periods (Periods 1\u201318), so no evidence of delays or losses. Demand has been elevated and sustained since Period 1 (carry-over insight recorded previously). To keep the OR engine responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime, set lead time to default (promised = 0) and use recent_N demand estimates based on the full recent regime (last 18 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service (capture recent higher mean) against holding cost by letting the backend compute base_stock from recent demand stats.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime vs Jan; the most recent periods (P17-19 demands =129,117,101) better reflect current demand than older low-Jan samples. To balance service (high profit $19) vs low holding cost $1, I bias forecast to recent demand: set mu_hat using recent 3-period mean (captures current demand level) and sigma_hat using recent 3-period volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the current higher-demand regime while avoiding excessive carry given holding cost. No evidence of missing shipments or lead-time creep.

Use promised lead time (default=0) so backend uses full sample history to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility; this is appropriate given stable observed lead time and ample demand history.

Recent demand has declined since the late-May peak; to capture the current lower-rate regime I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent behavior, reducing overstock risk given high on-hand and zero pipeline. This balances service level against holding cost (profit=19, holding=1) by lowering target base-stock to recent realized demand levels.

Demand showed a sustained lift earlier (carry-over note) but recent weeks (Periods 18\u201322) point to softer summer demand; to keep the forecast responsive I use an EWMA to emphasize recent demand while retaining longer-run signal. L set to default (promised 0). mu_hat set via EWMA_gamma to weight recent demand more heavily (gamma=0.3). sigma_hat left as default to let backend use full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised/default L. Recent demand (Periods 20-24 = 60,57,77,43,82) is lower and more variable than the earlier high-regime; to capture the current regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (covers last 5 weeks). This keeps target base-stock responsive to recent lower demand while sigma from recent data reflects current variability, balancing service vs holding given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). Demand has softened from spring peaks into summer; to capture recent regime I use recent data window to set demand forecast and volatility. No overdue shipments flagged. I select L=default (promised 0), mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the most recent 8 weeks, which balances service (captures recent demand drop) against holding cost to avoid excess stock.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and no lost shipments. On-hand=89, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is ample vs recent low weekly demand (Period 26 demand=28). Profit/holding ratio (19/1) implies higher service target but current on-hand reduces urgency. I choose L=default because all concluded lead-times =0 (no evidence to alter). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L); this avoids overfitting to short low-demand blips and leverages the long history while the on-hand buffer limits immediate stockout risk.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=127, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 23-27: 43,82,75,28,29) shows a lower, stable regime vs earlier high-spring levels. No delayed/lost shipments observed; historical lead times consistently 0. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (matches observed). To adapt to the recent low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (captures the most recent ~6 weeks' demand pattern) so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent window. This balances service vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost but current lower demand and healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/08/26 (Period 29). Recent demand has trended down from spring peaks; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [82,75,28,29,19], mean \u224846.6. On-hand =108, in-transit=0; inventory is ample versus current low demand so prioritize lowering target stock. No evidence of lead-time change (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). I set L to default (promised=0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent lower-demand regime and reduced volatility so the OR engine reduces order quantity and holding cost exposure.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=87, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period \u2192 retain promised lead time. Demand has dropped in summer: last 4 concluded demands (Periods 26-29) = 28,29,19,21 (avg ~24.25). To avoid excess holding while matching current low demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent 4-week regime. These parameters keep orders responsive to the current low-demand summer regime while L=default preserves supply timing assumptions.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Recent history shows 5 consecutive low-demand weeks (Periods 26-30: 28,29,19,21,16) with no outstanding arrivals\u2014no evidence of delayed shipments; historical observed lead times have been 0. I set L to default (promised 0). Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime (reduces overstock risk vs using all-sample mean). Volatility also from recent_N (N=5) to reflect lower recent variability. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to current low sales, lowering holding costs while preserving service given on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26 (2019-08-05): avg demand dropped to 22.6 over Periods 26-30 (28,29,19,21,16) vs avg ~65.7 over Periods 20-25 (60,57,77,43,82,75), a -65% change, sustained 5 periods.

Recent history (Periods 26-31) shows a sustained low-demand regime (demands: 28,29,19,21,16,21) confirmed in prior carry-over (drop starting Period 26). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically, and there are no overdue shipments. I therefore keep L at default (promised lead time=0). To reflect the new low-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (regime length=6) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and volatility from the most recent consistent data, reducing overstock while preserving service. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments required.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime beginning Period 26 (2019-08-05) with weekly demand ~22.6 (Periods 26-32: 28,29,19,21,16,21,19) vs prior higher regime. On-hand=31, in-transit=0 so current stock covers ~1\u20131.5 weeks at the new lower demand; no shipments outstanding. I set L=default because observed concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (no evidence to change). I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast on the confirmed low-demand regime (N equals the 7-period regime length: Periods 26\u201332). This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service at the lower demand level and keeps holding cost exposure low.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 26 (avg ~22.6 over P26-30) with continued low weekly sales P28-33 (19,21,16,21,19,52 where 52 likely stockout-driven). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the current low-demand regime. Promised lead time historically observed as 0 periods; no evidence of lead-time drift. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (covering Periods 28-33) to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid inflating forecast with older high-demand months. sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent lower volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward lower base stock and tighter caps, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for the new low-demand regime.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand regime dropped starting Period 26 (2019-08-05) and has stayed low (~20s) through Period 34; this is the most relevant recent regime. No evidence of lost shipments (orders resumed in Period 34 with 0 lead time). I set L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time. For demand I choose recent_N (N=9) to capture the lowered regime (Periods 26-34) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility, which reduces excess holding while maintaining service for the new lower demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 26 (2019-08-05) with mean ~22.6 over Periods 26-30 and continued low weekly demand through Periods 31-35 (mostly teens\u201320s) except a stockout-driven spike in Period 33. On-hand=26, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; expect one more week of demand after decision. I keep L as default (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (regime length = 10 weeks from P26\u2013P35) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the most recent low-demand regime; this reduces ordering toward the lower demand regime and limits holding cost while preserving service.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently; no evidence of delayed/lost shipments in concluded history. Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 26 (Aug) \u2014 recent demands: 28,29,19,21,16,21,19,52,27,18,36 (Periods 26\u201336). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals show 0 lead time. I use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the recently depressed demand regime (regime length 11), so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean and variance and avoid overstocking given the sustained lower demand. This balances the high profit/low holding-cost ratio (profit $19 vs holding $1) with evidence that mean demand has fallen since Period 26 and we have no in-transit cover.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 (arrivals same period), and a sustained demand regime drop beginning Period 26 (avg ~22.6). Recent demand since P26 is lower and more representative than earlier high-demand months. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 26\u201337, 12 samples) so the OR engine targets a lower base-stock appropriate to current demand, reducing excess holding cost while preserving service for the new lower-demand regime.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 34-38) = [27,18,36,44,25], avg \u2248 30 \u2014 clearly lower than earlier high-demand regime; no evidence shipments are delayed (historical concluded lead_time=0). Inventory covers <1 week of recent demand, so use a short lookback to capture current lower-demand regime. Set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the OR backend base-stock reflect the recent mean/volatility and avoid excess holding cost given low demand and low holding cost impact vs profit.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has remained in the lower regime that began Period 26 (avg ~22.6); latest concluded demands (Periods 26-39) are consistently low with occasional spikes (max 52). On-hand=36, in-transit=0 \u2014 pipeline is empty. All observed concluded lead times = 0, so I keep L at promised (default). To align the OR base-stock with the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates, taking N=14 (regime length Periods 26-39 = 14). This keeps forecasted (1+L)*mean focused on recent low demand to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service. Sigma also set from the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand 32, in-transit 0. Historical data shows a sustained lower-demand regime beginning Period 26 (Aug) with weekly demand mostly ~16\u201329 and occasional spikes; recent weeks (Periods 34\u201340) remain low. Promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so use default promised lead time. To align ordering with the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat using a recent_N window covering the detected low-demand regime (Periods 26\u201340, length 15) so the forecast reflects the lower mean. Use recent_N for sigma_hat over the same window (N=15) to capture current volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk given low demand and low holding cost while keeping service reasonable given limited pipeline (0).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Current on-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, and demand has been in the low regime since Period 26 (sustained drop). To avoid overstock while preserving service, keep L = default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (last 5 demands) to capture the current low-demand regime (more reactive than full-history mean) so the OR backend will target a lower base-stock and reduced cap, balancing $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand 24, in-transit 0. Historical concludes show promised lead time=0 and all observed arrivals (when placed) arrived with lead_time=0 \u2014 no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. Demand regime dropped starting Period 26 and has remained lower; to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N=17 (regime length since P26) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most relevant data. L left as default (promised 0) to avoid overreacting to transient gaps. This keeps service high for current low-demand regime while limiting holding cost from using older high-demand data.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows the low-demand regime that began at Period 26 (Aug) has persisted through Period 43 (sustained ~16-29 weekly). On-hand=34, in-transit=0; with promised lead time=0 arrivals are same-period, but none are currently in transit. I set L to default (promised 0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=18) to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime from Period 26\u201343 (regime length 18) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean over this regime rather than the higher historical mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=18) to capture volatility in the same recent regime. These choices reduce ordering to match the persistent lower demand and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service via the backend's service-level math.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Concluded history shows consistent same-day arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and current on-hand=36, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been low and stable (periods ~35-44: 18,36,44,25,11,13,11,21,9,7). No new sustained regime shift detected. I keep L as default (promised 0). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (last 10 demand samples) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and scales variability to recent observations, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows low steady demand since the late-summer drop (Periods 26-44 mostly low single- to low-double digits) with a stockout-limited spike in Period 45 (demand=76, sold=40). Actual observed lead times have been 0 historically. I keep L at promised/default (0). For mu_hat I use an EWMA to adapt to the recent low baseline but allow responsiveness to the Period 45 spike (gamma=0.3). For sigma_hat I use a recent_N estimate over the last 5 demand samples to capture current volatility while limiting influence of older, higher-variance regimes. These choices bias orders toward the recent low-demand regime while remaining somewhat responsive to a possible demand uptick, balancing profit vs holding cost given low holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Demand has been in the lower post-summer regime since Period 26 (avg ~22.6) with occasional holiday spikes in Periods 45-46; spikes are recent (2 periods) and not yet sustained. To be conservative and align the forecast with the sustained low-demand regime, I use recent_N=20 to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the post-Period-26 regime while allowing some recent variability). Keep L as promised (default=0) since concluded lead times are consistently 0. This balances avoiding excess holding (low holding cost) with modest service level for the low-demand regime while being able to respond if holiday spikes persist.
