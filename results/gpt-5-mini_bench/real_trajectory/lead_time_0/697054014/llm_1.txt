Product: womens blouse (everyday) \u2014 demand is fairly stable/regular, not highly seasonal. b) Demand regime: historical weekly samples provided show a clear downward trend over five weeks: 2019-01-07:132, 01-14:103, 01-21:92, 01-28:87, 02-04:80. Most recent week = 80; short-term forecast for the upcoming period \u2248 75\u201385 units (use 80 as point forecast). c) Lead time / pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Supplier promised LT=0 but actual LT unknown; follow guidance to cover (L+1) periods \u2014 with promised 0 that implies covering 1 period of demand. d) Inventory/pipeline assessment: no inventory and no arrivals visible; placing order is necessary to meet expected period demand. e) Order logic: balance service vs. holding cost \u2014 profit/unit = $4, holding = $1/period; expected marginal profit from selling one extra unit exceeds one-period holding cost, but demand uncertainty and recent downward trend counsel conservatism. Order sized to meet the one-period forecast (\u224880 units) to avoid lost sales while limiting excess ending inventory.",
