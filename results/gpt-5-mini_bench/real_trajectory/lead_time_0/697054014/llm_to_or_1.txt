Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples Jan 2019) shows stable declining short-run mean (~98.8) with moderate variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=0. No concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time shifts or lost shipments. Use default lead time and default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to provide a balanced service level given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed demand samples (historical weeks: 132,103,92,87,80) give a mean ~98.8; Period 1 sold ~116 (one-period spike but not sustained). No evidence of lead-time shift (Period 1 order arrived in Period 1, observed lead_time=0). I choose default lead time to trust promised L=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given profit/holding (q=0.8) while avoiding overreacting to a single higher sale. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments required.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands: P1=117, P2=169, which exceed historical weekly mean (~99 from Jan samples). Promised lead time=0 and concluded arrivals in P1 and P2 had lead_time=0, so keep L at promised. Demand shows a possible upward shift but only 2 high-demand periods\u2014insufficient for a confirmed regime change. Use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.5) to weight recent high demands more while retaining historical information. Keep sigma_hat at default to reflect overall historical volatility until a sustained variance change is observed. These choices raise target stock to improve service for recent higher demand while avoiding overreaction to a short blip.

Daily Reward (R_t): $588.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Recent realized weekly demand has jumped vs Jan baseline: Periods 1-3 demands = 117, 169, 150 (avg 145.33) vs earlier sample mean 98.8. On-hand=12, in-transit=0, promised lead_time=0 and observed lead_times in concludes = 0 for all prior orders. I set L by calculating observed lead time to confirm promised 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (uses last 3 realized demands) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the elevated demand while avoiding overstating variability from older low-demand weeks. This balances service level (meet higher recent demand) against holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and no in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: Periods 1-3 avg=145.33 vs prior sample mean=98.8 (+46.7%), sustained 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $617.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has risen materially vs historical sample (Periods 1-4 demands = 117,169,150,157; recent mean high). On-hand=11, in-transit=0 and no arrivals expected this period. I retain promised lead time (0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To capture the new higher demand regime I use recent_N for demand stats with N=4 (last 4 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds a higher base stock and accounts for recent volatility while keeping orders capped by the engine's cap. No explicit L adjustment despite overdue pipeline because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-5): 117,169,150,157,96 showing a sustained uplift earlier (Periods1-4) but with variability last period. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0. To balance service vs holding cost I use recent_N=5 to estimate demand (smooths the recent elevated regime while including the latest drop) and recent_N=5 for volatility. Keep L as default (promised 0) since concluded lead times are consistently 0 and no lost shipments observed.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P6 arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 4\u20136) = [157, 96, 102]; there was an earlier sustained regime lift in Periods 1\u20133 already recorded. To keep responsiveness to the latest regime while limiting overreaction, I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 3 periods (captures current volatility and short-term mean). Lead time set by calculate to confirm observed 0. Sigma uses recent_N over the last 3 samples to reflect current variability. These parameters let the OR engine size base-stock to cover the immediate (1+L) period demand with variance accounted for, balancing the $4 profit against $1 holding cost given limited on-hand stock and no in-transit units.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand (Periods 3-7) shows higher and variable demand; I use the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 3-7: 150,157,96,102,108) to capture the current mean/volatility while keeping sensitivity to recent regime. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to set (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. This balances service (capturing elevated recent mean) against holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand is elevated and volatile (recent demands P4-P8 = 157,96,102,108,151). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover the upcoming review+lead period. Promised lead time=0 and historical concludes show actual lead_time=0 consistently, so use default L. To capture recent elevated mean while limiting sensitivity to older low samples, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) (captures P4-P8 mean \u2248122.8 units for the (1+L) period). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR engine toward a base-stock matching recent demand while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability; with profit=4 and holding=1 this balances service vs holding cost given the observed regime shift and current zero inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand shows mixed recent outcomes after the confirmed Period 4 regime signal; last 5 demand samples (Periods 5-9) average ~111, capturing recent variability including a 151 spike. I choose L=default to reflect observed 0 lead time, mu_hat recent_N N=5 to adapt to the latest regime while smoothing older extremes, and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings aim to align base-stock with current mean demand (short horizon) while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variance, balancing service level against $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). No new sustained demand regime change since prior recorded insight. To keep policy aligned with observed stable lead time and overall historical samples, use default lead time and default demand variance/mean so backend uses all samples (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This balances service level from historical demand vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been elevated versus the initial sample (sustained shift recorded in carry-over). On-hand=17, in-transit=0 \u2192 low coverage for upcoming period(s). All observed concluded lead times = 0, so keep promised lead time. To capture the post-shift demand level while avoiding overreaction to one-off weeks, I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 8 concluded periods (Periods 4\u201311) to form mu_hat; this balances responsiveness to the higher regime with smoothing. I keep sigma_hat at default to let the backend scale variability across the review+lead window. These choices aim to raise target base-stock to meet the higher sustained demand while limiting excess holding by using a recent sample rather than all-time average.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in prior periods all arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 8-12 = 151,98,84,123,125) shows no new sustained regime change; using a recent-5 sample forecast captures the latest mix of high/low weeks. I keep L at the promised default (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. mu_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect the current short-run average demand (~116 units) for the (1+L) review+lead horizon. sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This balances service (by reacting to recent demand) against holding cost given low on-hand and no in-transit units.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time=0 consistently. Recent demand (Periods 9-13 = 98,84,123,125,89) suggests a moderate recent mean (~104) lower than the early-period spike; to be responsive to recent demand I use recent_N=5 for demand mean & volatility while keeping L=default (promised=0). This keeps orders aligned with current demand while the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2014 no evidence of delays or losses. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P10-P14 demands = 84,123,125,89,104) averages ~105 units/week; demand appears lower than the early-period spike and has stabilized. Profit=$4, Holding=$1 \u2192 high target service (q=0.8). I choose L=default (use promised 0). I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the most recent stable regime (captures the current ~105/week demand). I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep the base-stock aligned with recent demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent demand (Periods 11-15) averaged ~110 units/week with moderate variability; on-hand=10, in-transit=0 and historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Use promised lead time (default) since concluded history confirms L=0. To capture recent regime (post-shift) demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 samples (Periods 11-15) so the base-stock reflects current higher demand while keeping variability estimate recent. This balances high service level (profit/holding implies q=0.8) against holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time=0 consistently. Recent demand (Periods 12-16 = 125,89,104,111,64) averages ~98.6 \u2014 no sustained upward regime since the previously recorded Period 4 insight. Use promised lead time (default) so arrivals remain same-period. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the most recent demand mix (captures recent down-tick vs earlier spikes). Use default sigma_hat (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend retains full historical volatility for safety. This balances service level (using recent mean) against holding cost given modest on-hand stock and zero in-transit.

Use L=default to keep promised 0 (observed lead times all 0).

A sustained demand uplift was previously confirmed at Period 4; to capture the post-change regime I use recent_N over the most recent 15 concluded demand samples (Periods 4\u201318) for both demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher, sustained demand and reduce stockouts while controlling holding cost. L kept as default (promised lead time=0).

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent observed demand has declined vs earlier weeks: last 5 demands (Periods 15-19) = 111,64,55,62,42 (mean=66.8), on-hand=85, in-transit=0. No recent late/lost shipments observed (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the clear downward shift in average weekly demand and avoid over-ordering given current on-hand stock. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run variability. These choices reduce target stock and holding cost while maintaining service for the lower recent demand regime.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has been substantially lower than the early-period spike: last 5 realized weekly demands = [55,62,42,30,39] (Periods 17-21), avg \u224845.6. On-hand=24, in-transit=0 \u2192 low coverage vs. one-week demand but demand appears to be in a lower regime sustained for many weeks. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. To adapt to the recent lower-demand regime while keeping a high service level (profit/holding implies q\u22480.8), I use L=default (promised=0) and estimate demand and volatility from the recent 5 weeks (recent_N, N=5) so the OR backend sets base-stock tuned to the current regime and avoids overstock from earlier high-demand periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent weeks show moderate demand (~30-40/week) after earlier higher regime confirmed at Period 4; on-hand=15, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low. All concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0 (orders consistently arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. No evidence of lost shipments or new regime requiring explicit tuning.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show all previous orders arrived with lead_time=0 (no lost shipments); demand has been in a higher regime since Period 4 (carry-over previously recorded). I therefore keep L at promised (default). To capture the sustained post-changepoint demand I use a recent_N demand estimate over the most recent regime (use N=20 to cover the latest 20 samples). Sigma is left as default to let backend scale variability over (1+L). These choices provide the OR engine a base-stock anchored to recent elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to single-week noise and controlling holding cost with default volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-08-05. On-hand=74, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently \u2192 use default promised L. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P21-P25 = 39,33,37,40,39) shows a sustained lower summer regime vs earlier high-demand weeks, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current demand mean and variability across the review+lead period. This keeps target base-stock aligned with current lower demand to avoid excess holding while maintaining service given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen relative to earlier samples: last 5 period demands (Periods 22-26) = [33,37,40,39,63], mean=42.4. Historical concluded lead times have been 0. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast over the last 5 observations so the OR backend reduces base-stock and holding cost exposure while preserving service.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period (orders arriving same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows variability but no new sustained (>3 periods) regime shift since the previously recorded Period 4 shift; several recent high-demand periods (P26 demand=63, P27 demand=96) are not yet a 3+ period signal. To keep the OR engine calibrated to long-run history and confirmed lead time, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level (using full-sample estimates) against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=54, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed. Recent demand (Periods 24-28 = 40,39,63,96,69) averages ~61.4 units/week, lower than the earlier confirmed high-regime around Period 4. Promised lead time = 0 has been consistently observed in conclures. To balance high profit ($4) vs holding ($1) (service target q\u22480.8) while reacting to the recent lower demand, I set L=default (use promised 0), mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target stock aligned to current demand and avoids excess holding given no in-transit cover.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistently observed lead_time=0 (orders arriving same period). A demand regime shift was confirmed at Period 4 and has persisted; to capture the newer, higher-demand regime I use recent_N with N=20 (covers most recent sustained regime while respecting the N selection rule). L kept as default (promised=0) because concluded lead times are consistently 0. mu_hat and sigma_hat set to recent_N (N=20) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples, improving service under the sustained higher-demand regime while the capped ordering prevents excessive overstock.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must order to cover imminent demand. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods, so use default promised lead time. A demand regime shift was previously recorded (Periods 1-3); recent weeks show lower, stable demand. To focus the forecast on the latest pattern, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures Periods 26-30 demand: 63,96,69,76,103) so the base-stock reflects current mean and recent volatility while limiting exposure to older high values. This balances service (cover near-term demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Promised lead time historically 0 (all observed lead_times = 0). Use L=default. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime and increased variability so the OR backend raises target inventory and service level while controlling holding cost.

No concluded late/lost shipments; observed lead times historically 0. To respond to the recent uptick while limiting holding cost, I use a short recent window to estimate demand (captures the higher recent mean and volatility) and keep lead time as promised (default). This raises target base stock to reduce stockouts given current zero inventory while sigma from the same recent window lets the backend size safety stock for variability.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (no delays or lost shipments). Demand has shifted up vs the original sample; recent weeks (Periods 30-34) show elevated demand (103,132,125,184,119) so I bias forecasts to the recent regime. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent elevated mean (~132.6 units/week) across the review+lead period. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility driven by the 184 spike. These choices keep the OR backend responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while respecting the zero lead time and limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus lead. Historical concluded lead_times are consistently 0 \u2192 use default L. Recent demand (Periods 30-36) shows a sustained higher regime (weekly demands: 103,132,125,184,119,99,177) vs original sample mean 98.8 and prior confirmed regime shift at Period 4. To capture the recent elevated mean and volatility I use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (covers the last 8 concl. periods including the large spikes) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the recent window. This increases target base_stock to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat captures increased variability; default L keeps promised lead time (0) consistent with concluded arrivals.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Recent demand has trended higher since Period 30 (several weeks of 100+ units; last 5 demands = [184,119,99,177,135], mean\u2248142.8), no overdue shipments visible and historical lead times observed = 0. I use promised/default lead time to match observed behavior. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the elevated demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine raises the base-stock and caps appropriately to balance high service (profit > holding cost) against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently; no late/lost shipments observed. Recent demand has shifted upward vs early sample; last 5 weekly demands = [119,99,177,135,127] (mean \u2248131). To balance high service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 => q\u22480.8) with inventory cost, use promised lead time (default) and base stock computed from a recent 5-week demand estimate to capture the current regime and recent volatility.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (all concluded orders arrived same period), no missing shipments. Recent demand has been variable but no new sustained regime change since prior insight (Period 4 shift already recorded). Given stable observed lead time and no fresh changepoint, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend applies full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service level (maintain availability after recent high-demand weeks) against holding cost without overreacting to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 -> use default lead time. Recent demand has risen vs early-sample; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36-40) average ~127 units. Profit/holding implies high service level (q=0.8). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock and reduces stockouts while capping orders.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so keep promised lead time (default). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 4; to capture the recent demand level and variability I use the most recent data window rather than the long-run mean. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (recent 20 weeks) to adapt to the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting noise. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service (profit >> holding cost) but use recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given no in-transit units.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand shows elevated volatility including a large spike in Period 42 (d=178). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. To respond quickly to the recent uptick while controlling holding cost, I keep L at default (promised=0) and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the last 5 weeks' mean and variability.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show arrivals same period (observed lead_time=0 across history), so use promised/default lead time. No new sustained demand regime change since the previously recorded Period 4 shift, and recent weeks are noisy but not a new sustained pattern. To let the OR engine use full sample statistics and its calibrated service level tradeoff (profit $4 vs holding $1), use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock and cap are computed from all samples with L=promised. This balances service level (captures long-run elevated mean from the earlier regime shift) against holding costs given current on-hand and zero pipeline.
