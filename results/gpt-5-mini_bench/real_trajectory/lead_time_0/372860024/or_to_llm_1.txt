Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observed lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P46 arrivals), so any order placed this period will arrive before demand. Current on-hand = 30, in-transit = 0. Recent demand shows elevated holiday-week volumes (P45=81, P46=67) although a short lull occurred in Nov (P39\u2013P41). Profit per unit ($19) far exceeds holding cost ($1), implying a high critical fractile (\u22480.95) and favoring service over tight inventory cuts. OR's capped base-stock suggestion = 67 units already accounts for promised L and demand variability; given confirmed L=0 and ongoing holiday demand, I follow the OR recommendation to avoid stockouts this period. This yields arriving inventory = 30+67 = 97 available for Period 47 demand; holding cost risk is small relative to lost profit from stockouts during a holiday spike.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Lead time confirmed 0 so orders arrive before demand; recent holiday demand is high (P45\u2013P46 = 81,67). Follow OR's recommended 67 units to avoid costly stockouts given profit >> holding cost.",
