Conservatively target inventory \u2248 recent 1-period demand to avoid excess holding: desired on-hand after arrival = ~ (recent mean \u224817) to 25 to cover small variance.

Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so nothing available for Period 47 demand unless we order now. Demand analysis: most recent weeks (Periods 43\u201346) demands = 6, 2, 8, 7 \u2192 recent average \u2248 5.8 units/week; this low post-holiday level is sustained across four weeks. OR recommendation (49) is based on long-run history and promised lead time; with profit=holding ($1/$1) the critical fractile = 0.5 so safety stock should be minimal and reflect the short-run mean. Strategy: order to cover expected current-week demand with small buffer to avoid holding costs. Since lead time=0 (same-period arrival), an order of 8 units will arrive in time to meet Period 47 demand while keeping holding cost low. Therefore place order=8 for SKU 554772003.",
