OR suggests 121 units (uses historical avg & promised L), but given current high-demand/higher-variance regime and high stockout cost (profit $4 > holding $1), I prioritize avoiding lost sales.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (periods 1\u201346 all show arrived same period ordered). Therefore any order placed now will arrive during Period 47 and can satisfy Period 47 demand. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 75, in-transit = 0. Recent realized weekly demand has been elevated in Dec: Periods 43\u201346 demands = [98,154,133,75], 4-period mean = 115. OR recommended 62 units (uses long-run history and promised L) which appears low given recent spike and seasonality around late Dec. With profit $4 and holding cost $1 the critical fractile is 0.8, favoring service over minimal holding. Since lead time = 0, I target a one-period on-hand position \u2248 recent mean demand (\u2248115). Current on-hand 75 covers part of that, so order = 115 \u2212 75 = 40 to bring available inventory to ~115 for this period. This balances avoiding stockouts in a high-demand week while limiting additional holding cost after the peak. No in-transit or lost-shipment issues to account for. Final action: order 40 units for SKU 655784001.",
