Product is ladies high-waist skinny ankle jeans \u2014 seasonal demand likely rising entering spring collections and promotional retail cadence; recent weeks show strong customer interest. b) Demand regime analysis: Historical weekly sales show a clear upward regime starting 2019-01-21 (26, 111, 277) indicating rapidly increasing demand. Use recent trend as primary forecast. c) Lead time / missing orders: No concluded arrivals/history of deliveries yet; supplier promised LT=0 but actual LT unknown. Cannot infer LT from current info. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. With uncertain LT (could be >=1), current order must cover immediate period demand plus at least one period of risk. e) Final order logic: Given strong upward demand (recent 3-week average ~138, last week=277) and high profit per unit ($4) vs moderate holding cost ($1/period), prioritize service to capture sales. I place a replenishment to supply expected high demand this period and near-term uncertainty. Order quantity = 400 units.",
