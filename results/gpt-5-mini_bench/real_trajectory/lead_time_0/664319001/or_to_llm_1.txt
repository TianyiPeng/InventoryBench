Recent demand trend: last 5 periods demands = [53, 25, 31, 27, 15], mean \u2248 30.2 and clearly down from earlier peaks; the recent 5-period mean is a better short-term predictor than the long-run peaks. OR recommended 160 (base-stock using historical high-demand samples); that would create large holding cost given recent declining demand. Given high profit (19) vs holding (1) the service-level target is high, but recent sustained fall in demand argues against fully following OR. I target one conservative replenishment that covers ~2\xd7 short-term mean to avoid stockouts if demand is volatile but avoids heavy overstock: desired available stock \u2248 60\u201375. With 15 on-hand, I order 60 units so arrival raises availability to 75 units this period. This balances service (covers ~2.5\xd7 recent mean) with avoiding the large excess inventory implied by OR's 160 given the downtrend.

OR recommendation = 161 units (uses L=0 and large safety factor q=19/(19+1)=0.95 \u2192 z\u22481.645). Given lead time = 0 (so ordered units will immediately protect against stockout this period) and high profit relative to holding cost, I accept OR's recommendation to avoid costly stockouts during the holiday surge.

OR recommends 91 units using promised L and historical demand; that recommendation is sensible given high profit-to-holding ratio (q=19/20=0.95 \u2192 z*\u22481.645) and the need to cover possible high demand this period. With LT=0 we can top up immediately; ordering 91 brings available stock to 163 before demand, reducing stockout risk while holding cost ($1/unit) is low relative to profit. Final decision: follow OR recommendation of 91 units to protect against observed demand spikes while using confirmed LT=0.",
