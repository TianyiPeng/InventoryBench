No evidence yet of a sustained regime change or seasonal event. Lead time: supplier promised 0 but no concluded arrivals exist to confirm; actual lead time unknown. Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Given demand occurs after ordering and arrivals may or may not be same-period, we should cover at least current period demand plus a safety buffer to hedge against any short lead-time slip. Profit per unit is high ($19) vs holding cost low ($1/period), so overstock penalty is small relative to lost-sales cost. Decision: order 34 units (\u22482\xd7mean weekly demand) to cover this period and the next while allowing for variability and potential 1-period arrival delay.
