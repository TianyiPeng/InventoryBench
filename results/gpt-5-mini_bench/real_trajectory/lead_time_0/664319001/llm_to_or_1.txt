Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) appear stable. Promised lead time used (default). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a baseline base-stock that balances profit ($19) vs holding ($1). This avoids overreacting to noise given no sustained changepoint or late shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent actual arrival: Period 1 order of 25 arrived in Period 1 (lead_time=0). On-hand=11, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical weekly samples (5): mean=17, std\u22484.10. Promised lead time=0 and recent evidence supports same-period arrivals. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed behavior and simple demand signal, use default lead time and default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (base-stock around mean demand) against holding costs given profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times: Period1 arrival (ordered P1) lead_time=0, Period2 arrival (ordered P2) lead_time=0 -> average lead time = 0. Historical demand samples (Jan weekly): mean=17 units/week. Given stable recent arrivals at promised lead time and no evidence of demand regime change, use calculated lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service (using verified L=0) with holding cost by not inflating safety stock absent a detected spike or delay.

Daily Reward (R_t): $293.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows steady weekly demand (14,26,16 sold) and the provided historical samples (17,14,24,12,18). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. All three concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so I trust same-period arrivals. I select L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full sample stability and lets the backend balance the high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) via its service-level formula.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period1; Period2 order arrived Period2; Period3 order arrived Period3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $194.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded demands (P1-4): 14,26,16,11 and historical sample series (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean=17. Recent week-to-week volatility and a small downward drift vs. the historical mean justify using the most recent 4 concluded demands to forecast. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods in Period 4 conclude, so use promised/confirmed L=0. I choose recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the latest regime while still using multiple observations; this balances service level (protects against recent spikes like 26) versus holding cost by not overreacting to a single outlier.

Daily Reward (R_t): $212.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent realized lead time is 0 (concluded arrivals P1-P5 all same-period). Recent demand (Periods1-5) = [14,26,16,11,12], no sustained regime shift detected. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent 5 weeks' mean for (1+L)-period forecast; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps service high (using recent demand) while not inflating safety stock from older data, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Historical weekly demand samples: [17,14,24,12,18] (mean=17). On-hand=18, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead time has been observed consistently as 0 in concluded periods. I select L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed=0). I choose default for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples (stable demand sample set). This keeps the base-stock sized to average weekly demand (balances $19 profit vs $1 holding cost) and avoids overreacting to short-term noise given no recent changepoint and sufficient on-hand stock.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent weekly demand samples (historic series) have mean 17 units/week and std ~4.10. On-hand=1, in-transit=0; recent sells show intermittent spikes (24) but overall mean stable. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods, so use promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (captures full-sample demand estimate). This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by letting the OR engine set a base-stock that targets the critical fractile while respecting the cap; keeping L/default uses the confirmed 0-period lead time and avoids overreacting to one-week spikes.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=0 (orders arriving same period across Periods1-8). Recent demand samples (weekly) are stable around mean ~17. Promised lead time remains appropriate. Using default L (promised), default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level and holding cost given steady demand and low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand (Periods1-9) mean \u224818.44 units, recent volatility present (demands 8\u201332). Carry-over confirms actual lead time=0 (observed repeatedly through Period4). Given zero observed lead time and no evidence of lost shipments, use default lead time and let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std so it applies the profit/holding tradeoff (high service level since profit $19 vs holding $1). This balances service vs inventory cost while responding to recent demand variability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and recent demand has risen sharply (Periods 6-10: 8,24,23,32,56). Promised lead time is 0 and prior concludes confirm actual L=0. I set L=default to use promised (confirmed). Demand appears to have shifted upward starting around Period 6, so I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new regime (uses Periods 6-10). This ensures the OR backend targets higher base stock to reduce stockouts during the sustained demand increase while sigma_hat recent_N reflects increased variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 6: avg demand Periods1-5 = 17.0 vs Periods6-10 = 28.6 (+68%). Sustained for 5 periods.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). Recent history shows confirmed lead time=0 (arrivals matched orders P1-P11) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (Periods 6-10 average much higher than 1-5, with extreme spikes in P10-P11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand plus lead. I set L=default to use promised lead time (confirmed=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (captures the post-changepoint regime Periods 6-11) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and volatility; this raises the base-stock to reduce stockouts given high recent demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to balance profit vs. holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 6 (higher mean from Periods 6\u201312). To capture the recent higher demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 6\u201312, length=7). L uses default (promised=0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent high-demand regime, balancing service level versus holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Recent sustained demand regime shift observed starting Period 6 (higher demand through Periods 9-13). Use promised lead time (confirmed as 0 in history) so arrivals are same-period; to capture the new higher-demand regime, set demand forecast using the most recent 5 samples (Periods 9-13) for both mean and volatility. This raises the base stock to meet elevated demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0. Demand shows sustained regime shift starting Period 6 (Periods 6-14 higher demand). I set L=default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime: regime from Period 6\u201314 length=9, so mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=9 to capture the higher recent mean and volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping holding impact explicit to the OR engine.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27): on-hand=52, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (Periods1-15 concluded arrivals same period). Demand regime increased starting Period 6 (Periods1-5 mean=17.0 vs Periods6-15 mean\u2248120/10=12? \u2014 correction: using Periods6-15 high-demand regime evident from sustained large orders/demand since P6). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=10 (Periods6\u201315) to focus estimates on the elevated-demand regime and recent volatility, improving service with controlled holding given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (Periods 6-16 elevated vs Periods1-5). All concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. On-hand=29, in-transit=0. I keep L at default (promised 0) consistent with concluded evidence. For demand I focus on the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 6-16) so the backend computes mu_hat as (1+L)*mean of the last 11 samples\u2014this captures the higher recent mean and avoids dilution by the lower early-period samples. For volatility use recent_N N=11 to reflect current variability. These settings bias orders toward higher service for the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping holding penalty explicit to the OR engine.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 6 (higher weekly demand sustained through Period 17). On-hand=12, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To keep the OR engine responsive to the new higher-demand regime, I set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, so the backend computes demand (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility based on the last 12 observed weeks (Periods 6\u201317). This targets service during the sustained high-demand regime while letting the capped ordering rule limit excessive orders and holding cost exposure.

To capture the new higher-demand regime, use recent_N with N=13 (Periods 6\u201318) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent high-demand regime, balancing service vs holding cost given high profit ($19) and low holding ($1).

Historical concl. show confirmed lead time 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (Periods1-5 mean=17.0 vs Periods6-10 mean=28.6, sustained thereafter). To protect service while limiting holding cost, keep L=default (promised 0, confirmed by concludes). Use recent demand statistics from the post-changepoint regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 (covers Periods6-19, the sustained higher-demand regime) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent regime and raises the base-stock to meet higher demand.

No overdue shipments visible. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I set L via observed lead times and base demand estimates on the post-changepoint sample window (Periods 6\u201320, 15 observations) so the OR engine's base-stock and cap use recent higher mean/volatility. This increases service level to capture elevated demand while the relatively low holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit) tolerates extra inventory to avoid lost sales.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 6 that persisted through the latest concluded period (Periods 6\u201324, ~19 weeks). All concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0 (no missing shipments). On-hand = 34, in-transit = 0; with lead time 0 we must cover current-period demand after ordering. I set L to use the default promised lead time (0) consistent with consistent concluded evidence. For demand and volatility I use recent_N over the sustained high-demand regime to capture the new higher mean/variance (N=19 \u2248 Periods6\u201324). These parameters direct the OR engine to raise base stock to the new demand level while keeping caps in place to limit excessive orders; because shipments have reliably concluded same-period, no explicit lead-time extension or safety for lost shipments is needed.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (Periods 1-25 orders all arrived same period) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (noted earlier). To respect confirmed LT=0 use 'calculate' so backend sets L=0 from observed lead times. For demand I use a recent_N window to capture the post-shift regime (stable higher volume since Period 6); recent_N N=20 uses the most recent 20 concluded demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean, keeping the forecast aligned to the sustained higher-demand regime while avoiding over-ordering given current high on-hand. Sigma set to recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize matching the confirmed short lead time and the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting additional ordering given substantial on-hand inventory to balance profit vs. holding cost.

Recent demand has been at a higher regime since Period 6 and remains elevated; to capture recent shape I use the last 10 demand samples for demand estimate and volatility (balancing service level vs holding cost given high profit:$19 vs holding:$1).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed Periods1-27). On-hand is healthy (133) and in-transit = 0. Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting Period 6 (noted in carry-over): recent weeks remain at elevated levels through Period 27. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 demand observations (captures the post-changepoint regime while limiting noise). This balances service (capture higher mean) vs holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=148, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 6 (higher weekly demand since). On-hand already covers ~1+L weeks of demand short-term but demand remains elevated and volatile. I keep L as default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint elevated demand regime (use the last 20 demand samples to estimate mean and volatility across the review+lead period). These parameters push the OR base-stock to reflect the higher demand while capping orders via the backend cap to limit excess holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=149, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data confirm actual lead time = 0 (recorded earlier) and a demand regime shift beginning Period 6 (higher mean from P6\u2013P10). Recent 5-week demand (P25\u2013P29) has been moderate (132,90,81,58,54) providing no clear further sustained shift. With lead time confirmed 0, use default lead time to let backend trust promised behavior. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this balances service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding overreacting to short recent fluctuations given ample on-hand stock and no in-transit.

Promised lead time is 0 and prior conclude messages confirm 0 lead time. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time=0. To reflect the most recent demand pattern and avoid overstock, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures last 5 demands: 81,58,54,40,53 \u2192 mean \u224857.2). I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These settings bias ordering toward recent lower demand while preserving service given high on-hand inventory.

Recent demand has moderated from the earlier high regime; to capture current run-rate I use a recent_N forecast on the last 5 periods (Periods 29-33) giving a mean \u224840.6 units (mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7mean with L=0). Volatility estimated from the same 5 most-recent samples to reflect current variance.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods1-4 and many subsequent confirms). Recent demand has fallen sharply since Period 32 (demands 25,31,27). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history supports same-period arrivals. To adapt to the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of the last 3 weeks (Periods32-34), reducing order quantities and holding cost risk while preserving service. This keeps available stock roughly aligned to current demand (~28/week) given on-hand=46 and no in-transit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 32: avg Periods26-30 = 64.6 vs Periods32-34 = 27.7 (\u221257%), sustained for 3 periods (Periods32\u201334).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (multiple arrivals same period). Demand has dropped starting Period 32 (Periods 32-35 demands = 25,31,27,15; recent regime average \u224824.5 over 4 periods), so I bias forecasts to the recent low-demand regime. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0) since conclude history robustly confirms 0. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime (regime length = 4), so the backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 4 samples, reducing order quantities and holding cost risk given current on-hand stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm lead time = 0. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 32 ( Periods 32\u201336 demands = 25,31,27,15,11; avg=21.8 over 5 periods) vs earlier Periods26\u201330 avg=64.6. I therefore set L to default (promised/confirmed 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime (5-period sustained evidence). Sigma also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base stock to match the sustained lower demand and avoid excess holding cost while keeping service for the current regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: avg Periods26-30 = 64.6 vs Periods32-36 = 21.8 (\u221266%), sustained for 5 periods (Periods32\u201336).

No evidence of new lead-time delays (historical concluded lead time = 0). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N over the most recent 6 concluded periods to set forecast mean and volatility; compute L from observed lead times.

On-hand=20, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent low-demand regime (last 7 periods) to keep target stock aligned with the current lower demand and avoid excess holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical conclues confirm lead time = 0 (sustained). Demand dropped starting Period 32 and has stayed low (Periods 32\u201339 mean \u224817.5). No overdue shipments. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period reality. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 32\u201339) to capture the new lower regime; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep target base-stock aligned to the sustained lower demand, reducing excess holding while preserving service given lead time=0.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=19, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has drifted down: last 5 concluded demands (Periods36-40) = [11,8,15,8,14], mean=11.2 \u2014 materially lower than earlier regimes. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, I forecast (1+L)\xd7mean using the most recent 5 samples and estimate volatility from the same window. Methods chosen: L=default to reflect confirmed 0 lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=5 to adapt to recent low-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent variability.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (many arrivals same period). Demand fell sharply starting Period 32 and has remained at a lower regime (Periods 32\u201341 average \u2248 21.8 then more recently \u22489.6 over last 10 weeks). To avoid overstocking given low holding cost sensitivity and preserve service, use promised lead time (default=0) and base demand on the recent low-demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 10 periods to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (N=10) so the OR backend sizes base-stock for current low-demand volatility and avoids excessive ordering.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been much lower since the late-September regime shift (Periods 32\u201336 onward); last 5 concluded weekly demands = [15,8,14,3,36], mean \u224815.2, indicating a lower-demand regime vs earlier high season. Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed in conclude messages). To avoid excess holding while maintaining service, set L=default (use promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime (captures latest mean over 5 weeks). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps base stock responsive to the new lower mean and reduces overstock risk given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2014 use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (last 5 weeks: Periods39\u201343 = 8,14,3,36,47) shows elevated variability and a holiday spike; to reflect current mix of low baseline + recent spikes, use recent_N=5 for both demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets a base-stock that covers the short lead time while capturing recent spike risk.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent weeks show lower, more volatile demand versus earlier peaks; on-hand=41, in-transit=0 so no outstanding arrivals. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0. To reflect the recent post-peak regime and short lead time, I use recent_N (last 5 weeks) for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine sizes base-stock to recent demand while avoiding excess holding.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a large demand spike in Period 45 (demand=125) causing stockout; prior weeks (Periods 36\u201344) were much lower. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded messages, so use lead-time inference rather than the promised default. To react to the large recent spike while still smoothing noise, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 0). Use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) so the recent high demand raises the base-stock quickly but not fully; choose sigma_hat based on recent variability using the last 5 periods to capture the recent volatility around the spike. These settings aim to raise target inventory to avoid imminent stockouts (improving profit) while keeping holding cost moderation via moderate gamma and short-window volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in history). On-hand=82, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Recent demand shows a large spike in Periods 45\u201346 (125, 92) but prior weeks are moderate (36,47,12). To balance service vs holding cost I set L=default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the recent elevated demand while still smoothing the single-week low (12). This ensures the OR engine targets a higher base stock to cover the recent spike but uses recent volatility for the cap calculation to limit extreme orders.
