Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 57.4 units/week and no evidence of a sustained regime shift (only 5 samples). On-hand and in-transit are zero and promised lead time is 0. Given no concluded arrivals or lost-shipment signals, I use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This keeps the base-stock aligned with historical demand while the profit/holding cost ratio in the OR engine will set service level.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed P1 arrived P1 (lead_time=0). No sustained demand regime change detected (historical weekly samples: 71,60,46,48,62; recent sale on P1=75 is a single uptick). I therefore set L by averaging observed lead times to capture the confirmed 0-period actual lead time. With no sustained changepoint, use default demand stats so mu_hat and sigma_hat = backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples). This balances service (captures observed same-period arrivals) without overreacting to a single high week.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. SKU 554450036 on-hand=20, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (71,60,46,48,62) -> mean=57.4. Concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 in Periods 1 and 2, so use observed lead time. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) the backend should target a high service level; therefore keep demand and volatility estimates based on all samples with L set to observed average.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1362.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean (2019-01 weeks) = 57.4; more recent realized weekly demands (Periods 1-3) = [75, 60, 72], indicating a higher recent mean. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (confirmed by 3 concluded arrivals). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 realized weekly demands to capture the apparent upward regime and avoid understocking. For sigma I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (higher \u03bc\u0302 from recent demand) while keeping variability updated to limit excessive safety stock and holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (orders placed P1-P3 arrived same period); Demand regime shift: recent avg (Periods1-3)=69 vs historical avg=57.4 (+20.3%)

Daily Profit: $931.00, Daily Holding Cost: $34.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $897.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent on-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical baseline mean=57.4 (5-sample), but a confirmed demand uptick in Periods1-3: avg=69 (+20%). Promised lead time previously confirmed as 0. I set L to default (use promised 0) so orders can arrive same period. To capture the recent regime shift, mu_hat uses recent_N with N=3 (periods 1-3 mean=69 \u2192 (1+L)*69). Volatility is set to recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. This raises the base stock to match the higher short-run demand while keeping holding cost impact explicit to the backend through the cap.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (consistent P1-P5). On-hand=31, in-transit=0 so no incoming stock visible. Recent demand has moderated: last 3 demands = [72,49,49], mean \u224856.7. To match current lower demand and confirmed 0 lead time, set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to make the backend forecast based on the most recent regime and reduce excess inventory risk given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent observed lead times consistently 0 (Periods1-6 concluded arrivals same period). Recent demand (Periods1-6) average = 57.83, similar to historical mean (57.4) after an early spike; latest three periods show some softening but not a sustained regime change. On-hand=37, in-transit=0 so we maintain same-period lead time and set demand forecast using the most recent 6 periods to reflect current realized demand. L kept at promised (0) to match confirmed arrivals; mu_hat recent_N=6 to capture current mean demand; sigma_hat recent_N=6 to capture recent volatility and avoid understating variability given recent swings. This balances service (cover current demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than the older historical sample alone.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Observed lead times have been consistently 0 in concluded history (P1\u2013P7 arrivals same period). On-hand=37, in-transit=0; recent demand has fallen since Period 3 (P5\u2013P7 demands = 49,42,43; recent mean \u224844.7) so I use a short recent window to capture the new lower regime. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to base (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent stable regime, reducing overstocks while maintaining service.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish immediately. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (previously confirmed). Recent demand shows a modest downshift after initial high weeks; last 5 observed demands (Periods4-8 = 49,49,42,43,70) average ~50.6. To be responsive to the recent regime while keeping variability captured, set L to default (promised 0), use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat based on the last 5 periods, and match sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This balances high service level implied by profit/holding (q\u22480.95) with reduced mean from recent lower demand.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/15. On-hand=26, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P9 arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 5\u20139 = 49,42,43,70,44) shows a lower, slightly more variable regime than early high values. I select L=calculate to lock in observed lead time=0. For mu_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent 5-week average demand (captures current regime around ~49.6 units). For sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility (captures observed variation including the 70 spike). These choices keep base-stock responsive to the recent lower mean while preserving safety for recent volatility, balancing profit vs. holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=29, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments visible; historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand (P9-11 = 44,45,40) is lower than the early spike but not a sustained new regime beyond prior carry-over. I therefore keep promised lead time (default) and use default demand/volatility inputs so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps safety stock driven by full-sample uncertainty while avoiding overreaction to short fluctuations, balancing $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has been moderate after the earlier uplift; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [70,44,45,40,55] (avg=50.8). On-hand=20, in-transit=0 so no incoming coverage for this period. Historical conclude messages confirm lead time=0 (no recent delays). I select L=default to use promised lead time (0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to anchor the (1+L)\xd7mean to the most recent regime (captures the post-spike normalization). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices balance service (using recent mean) against holding cost given low holding penalty ($1) vs profit ($19).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1-P13) consistently show actual lead time = 0; recent demands elevated vs Jan baseline but signal was already recorded in carry-over. Given stable 0 lead time and no new sustained changepoint, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost using observed variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sharp single-week spike (P14=107) but prior five weeks (P10-P14) average is elevated (~62) vs earlier baseline. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (many concluded messages). To balance service vs holding cost I use L=default (promised 0). I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast and uncertainty responsive to the recent upward demand and increased volatility while avoiding overreacting to a single-week extreme. This ensures the OR engine increases base stock modestly to cover higher recent demand but keeps cap constraints to limit excess holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand increased sharply (Periods 14-15: 107, 139) indicating a higher recent mean than long-run samples. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To react to the recent upshift while keeping service, I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean and sigma_hat uses the same window to capture increased volatility. Using default lead time keeps promised 0 (confirmed by history) and avoids inflating pipeline assumptions given no overdue shipments.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical sample mean=57.4 (Periods 1-5) but recent weeks show elevated demand (Periods 12-16). Promised lead time is 0 and prior conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0. I therefore keep L as default (promised=0) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility to capture the recent higher-demand regime (Periods 12-16). This increases target base-stock to preserve service given high profit (q\u22480.95) while sigma based on recent volatility prevents overconfidence. On-hand (61) covers less than the recent 5-period average demand (~90.6), so the OR engine will likely order to replenish toward the higher recent mean.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed in recent periods (Periods 12-16): recent 5-period avg \u2248 90.6 vs historical avg 57.4 (+58%), sustained over 4+ periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (P1\u2013P17); demand has shifted up recently \u2014 Periods 12\u201316 5-period avg \u224890.6 vs historical mean 57.4 (+~58%). On-hand is 101 and in-transit 0. To reflect the new higher demand regime while keeping safety sizing responsive, set L to promised (default=0) and forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods (captures the confirmed elevated demand). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) so the backend scales safety by recent volatility. This increases target base stock to meet higher demand and reduces stockouts while holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19), so prioritizing service is appropriate.

Recent demand regime (Periods 12-16) is elevated (5-period avg \u2248 90.6 vs historical avg 57.4). To capture the sustained higher demand, set L to default (promised 0) and forecast demand using the most recent 5 periods. Use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock and cap to the new regime while holding lead time at 0.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Historical baseline (Jan samples) mean=57.4. Recent history showed a higher-demand regime around Periods 12-16 (5-period avg \u224890.6) but demand has softened in the last 5 periods (Periods 15-19) with avg = 69.4. All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 consistently and on-hand = 119, in-transit = 0. To reflect the most recent demand pattern while respecting confirmed lead time=0, I set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the latest 5-period demand mean/volatility (covers current review+lead period). This keeps service high while avoiding excess holding given current on-hand cover.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=135, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed have arrived same period). Recent demand has moderated after a high period around P12-16; last 5 demands (P16-P20)=[88,46,40,34,8], recent mean \u224843.2. To avoid further overstocking given high on-hand, use a short recent-window forecast (last 5 periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat while keeping promised lead time (default=0). This biases orders toward current lower recent demand and reduces holding cost risk.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand shows elevated and volatile periods around May (Periods 12-16) but the last 5 demands (Periods 17-21 = 46,40,34,8,79) average ~41.4, lower than the mid-May spike and more variable. I set L via calculate to reflect confirmed actual lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime and avoid being pulled by the short-lived May spike; sigma_hat also recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward stocking for the recent observed demand level while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variability, balancing service against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been variable: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 18-22) = [40,34,8,79,79], recent 5-period mean = 48. I choose L=default to trust the promised/observed 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to make the (1+L)-period forecast responsive to the sharp recent variability and current low pipeline. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than long-run variance, avoiding over-ordering from older high-demand spikes. This balances service (responsive replenishment given low on-hand) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base_stock from recent demand statistics.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=59, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead time = 0 consistently (orders concluded P1\u2013P24). Recent demand (Periods20-24) = [8,79,79,73,49], 5-period mean \u224857.6, near historical mean (57.4) after earlier high regime; demand volatility remains elevated. Use lead time estimate reflecting observed behavior (0). Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand level and volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show consistent lead_time=0 across many periods -> use observed average. Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = 79,79,73,49,51) is above historical baseline; use recent_N=5 to capture this elevated regime for mean and volatility. These settings (L=calculate; mu_hat and sigma_hat based on last 5) raise target base-stock to meet the higher short-term demand while avoiding excessive inventory buildup given holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently; demand has experienced a prior sustained upshift (Periods 12\u201316) but recent periods show mixed values. To keep OR engine aligned with observed zero actual lead time and stable long-run demand estimate, I use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service vs holding given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0. Recent demand has settled above long-run historical mean; last 7 periods avg \u224875, last 5 periods avg \u224874. To react to the recent higher regime while keeping safety limited (lead time 0), I use a recent-5 demand estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine focuses on the most relevant recent demand volatility and level. L kept at promised/default (0) because concludes confirm same-period arrivals and no lost shipments.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (many P1\u2013P28 arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has been elevated versus historical: last 5 demand obs (Periods 24\u201328) = [49,51,91,106,101], 5-period mean \u2248 79.6, last 3 mean \u2248 99.3. On-hand=14, in-transit=0, so we need coverage for current period demand after ordering. I select L=default to reflect the consistently confirmed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher-demand regime while smoothing short-term noise; this raises the base-stock and volatility used by the OR backend to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while controlling excess inventory via the cap.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 0 (sustained) and a demand regime uplift around Periods 12-16; recent realized demand remains elevated vs early history. To be responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost, I use promised/default lead time and base demand forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current regime. Thus L=default, mu_hat=recent_N with N=5, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5.

Demand has shown a sustained upward regime since around Period 17; recent weeks remain elevated. To capture the current higher-demand regime while keeping lead-time accurate, set L via calculate (observed lead times=0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 weeks of demand so the OR backend raises the base stock to meet the sustained higher demand while limiting excess hold cost given current on-hand inventory.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many P conclude lines with arrived=ordered same period). Recent demand has shifted up vs early-year baseline: last 5 concluded demands (P27-P31) = [101,101,56,104,87], recent 5-mean \u2248 89.8 vs historical mean \u224857.4 (+57%). To balance service level (high recent demand) vs holding cost ($1/unit), I use L=default (promised lead time = 0, supported by concluded arrivals). I set mu_hat via recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher demand regime; this targets (1+L)*mean_last5 \u2248 89.8 units. I set sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and let the OR backend compute safety stock. This keeps orders responsive to the sustained higher demand while avoiding excess stock from older low-demand periods.

Recent demand (Periods 28-32) average \u224882 units/week, higher than long-run historic mean (57.4). To adapt to the recent elevated regime while keeping variability responsive, set L to promised (default=0) and use a recent_N=5 estimate for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 demand samples (Periods 28-32). This increases target base-stock to cover the current higher demand while sigma_hat from recent data captures current volatility for service-level sizing and limits excess holding given low holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier), so keep promised lead time. Demand has shifted upward and recent weeks are high/volatile (recent 5-week demands: P29-33 = 56,104,87,62,136; mean\u224889). To restore service while limiting holding cost, set L=default (promised 0) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the current elevated mean; use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to meet current demand spikes without over-smoothing with older low-demand data.

Recent demand remains in the elevated regime: last 5-week demand avg = 96.6 (Periods 30\u201334) vs historical avg ~57.4 (+68%). To align orders with the higher recent run-rate while avoiding excess holding, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples so the OR engine sizes base stock to the elevated demand and captures recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the confirmed higher regime while leveraging L=0 to avoid over-ordering for unseen lead-time risk.

To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and preserve high service (q=19/20=0.95) while keeping holding low, I set L based on observed lead times, use a recent-5 demand forecast for mu_hat, and capture recent volatility with recent-5 for sigma_hat.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed in conclude messages). Recent demand is volatile; last 5 periods demands = [62,136,94,53,57] (mean\u224880.4), lower than the earlier sustained high regime but above long-run historical mean (~57). To balance service vs. holding cost, use a short recent-window forecast to adapt to current volatility: keep L=default (promised 0), set mu_hat based on recent_N with N=5 to reflect current average demand over the (1+L) review period, and set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture recent variability. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been elevated vs historical: last 5 demands (P33-37) = [136,94,53,57,85], 5-period average \u224885. On-hand=54, in-transit=0 (no incoming). Historical baseline mean=57.4 but recent regime remains higher; confirmed lead times historically =0. I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to better meet near-term demand while keeping holding cost in mind given significant on-hand inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=50, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals pending (no overdue shipments). Recent demand has been elevated vs early historical levels but shows some variability: Periods 34-38 demands = [94,53,57,85,91], recent 5-period avg \u224876. I set L=default (promised 0; historical concludes confirm 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand periods. This raises the base-stock to meet near-term elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to protect service level; capping in OR backend controls excess ordering and holding cost exposure.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders from P1\u2013P39 all arrived same period), so keep promised lead time (L=0). Recent demand has been higher than long-run historical mean (many recent weeks above 57.4); to capture this sustained higher regime while remaining robust, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat using the last 20 demand samples. Sigma left as default to let backend scale volatility over the review+lead horizon. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19) and zero lead time, while keeping volatility estimation generic.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time consistently 0 in all past periods. Recent history shows earlier confirmed demand regime shifts (recorded previously) but no new sustained changepoint in the last 3+ periods. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and long-run demand estimates, I use default lead time and default demand moments (uses all samples). This balances service (uses full-sample mean) versus holding cost given current moderate on-hand inventory and no in-transit stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical baseline mean (early samples) = 57.4, but carry-over insight shows a sustained demand regime shift since ~Period 12\u201317 with recent weeks exhibiting substantially higher demand (multi-week averages near 75\u201395). No evidence of lead-time degradation (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To prioritize service while containing holding cost, I use the promised lead time (default L=0) and set demand forecast and volatility to recent_N (N=10) to capture the elevated recent demand regime (smooths short spikes but reacts to sustained higher demand). This increases target base-stock relative to the long-run baseline and provides the OR engine a realistic \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302 reflecting current demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent week (P42) showed a large demand spike (268) after several weeks of moderate demand; this spike may indicate elevated near-term demand but is not yet a 3+ period sustained regime change. Promised lead time has been reliably observed as 0 in concluded history. To protect service for potential short-term elevated demand while keeping model aligned with recent observations, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to bias the forecast toward the last 5 weeks (captures the recent spike risk), and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect increased recent volatility. This balances higher service level against holding cost given immediate stockout risk.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent history: lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded periods; large demand spike at Period 42 (268) likely holiday/Black Friday effect but not yet a sustained multi-period shift. Current inventory: on-hand=187, in-transit=0 so no overdue shipments. Choice rationale: keep L as default (promised=0) since observed lead time remains 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the recent elevated demand (captures Periods 39-43 demand pattern including the holiday spike) while avoiding over-reliance on long-run historical average. This balances higher short-term service-level needs during the holiday surge against holding cost given substantial on-hand stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=186, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders always arrived same period), so keep L as promised (default). Recent weeks show one large spike (Period 42 demand=268) likely holiday-driven but not a sustained regime shift (subsequent demands 71,70). No strong evidence to change demand mean/volatility estimates; use default computations so backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps the OR base-stock anchored to long-run demand while preserving responsiveness to the single-period spike via standard deviation. Holding cost is low relative to profit (q\u22480.95), so backend will target high service level\u2014using default stats avoids overreacting to a single-week outlier.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=105, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead times = 0 (all concluded arrivals same period) so keep L as default (promised=0). Recent demand has stepped up (last 5 period demands = 69,268,71,70,81; recent 5-period avg \u2248111.8) and shows elevated mean and volatility vs long-run samples, so use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher demand regime and increased variance. This raises the base-stock to preserve service during the higher-demand window while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to reduce stockouts; default L keeps orders same-day arrival assumption consistent with observed history.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=202, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed P1-P46 arrivals same period). Recent demand shows elevated variability with a large spike at Period 42 (268) but subsequent demands (P43-P46) are 71,70,81,54. Given confirmed lead time=0 and substantial on-hand inventory, I avoid increasing target safety via long-horizon forecasts. I set L to default (promised 0). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent demand regime (captures the recent spike plus subsequent weeks) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples. For sigma_hat I keep default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (captures recent demand jump) while avoiding unnecessary new orders given large on-hand stock.
