Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 561445006 has recent weekly demand samples (61,71,61,52,51). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer lead-time issues or demand regime shifts. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on all samples to let the OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding overreacting to limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-02-18. Recent concluded history shows Period1 order (67) arrived in Period1 (lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period1 demand was 98 (single high week) vs. historical sample mean ~59.2. No sustained demand regime change (only one high observation), so keep demand estimate based on all samples. Set L via observed average lead time to confirm 0; use default demand/volatility calculations to let OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding overreaction to a one-off spike.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period1 order placed P1 arrived P1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded history shows two immediate arrivals (P1 and P2 orders both arrived same period), confirming actual lead time = 0. Demand in the last two periods (98, 92) is well above the older sample mean (~59), but this uplift is only 2 periods long \u2014 not yet a sustained regime shift. To be responsive yet conservative, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (captures confirmed 0); set mu_hat via EWMA (gamma=0.3) to upweight recent high demand without overreacting; keep sigma_hat as default to use full-sample variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost given short lead time and limited evidence for a durable demand shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04): On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands show a clear upward shift vs historical samples: Periods 1-3 concluded demands = 98, 92, 130 (avg 106.7) vs historical mean 59.2. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior conclude messages. Because the demand increase is recent and sustained (3 periods), use a recent_N demand estimate (N=3) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new regime; keep L as default (promised lead time=0). This raises the base_stock and safety stock to capture the higher demand while the OR backend will cap order size to limit excess holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed at Periods 1-3: recent avg demand = 106.7 vs historical avg = 59.2 (+80%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand shows a sustained upward regime: Periods 1-3 average = 106.7 (vs historical ~59.2). On-hand=40, in-transit=0; lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded history. To respect the confirmed fast replenishment and recent higher demand, set lead time based on observed history and forecast demand using the most recent 3-period regime to capture the shift and recent volatility. This balances service (capture higher demand) vs holding cost by not using long-horizon historical low demand.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical baseline mean=59.2 (Jan samples) but recent demand is materially higher: last 3 periods demands = [130,84,102], mean = 105.33. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default LT=0. Given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (high desired fill rate q=0.8), raise forecasts to recent regime. Therefore set L=default (0), use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime, and recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This increases base-stock to meet elevated demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has been consistently high (~100 units) for the last 6 periods (P1-P6: 98,92,130,84,102,101; mean=101.17). On-hand=24, in-transit=0; lead time observed historically is 0. I set L via calculate to lock in observed 0-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime (6-period regime), so the OR backend sizes base stock and cap using the recent mean/volatility rather than older low-demand samples\u2014this balances service (capture current ~100/week demand) against holding cost given on-hand inventory and zero lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=10, in-transit=0. Historical pre-shift mean=59.2 (older samples) but recent demand is materially higher and sustained (periods with demands: 98,92,130,84,102,101,105). Lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history. I set L by calculating observed lead times to capture confirmed 0-period actual lead time. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=7) to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (uses the last 7 observed demand samples) so mu_hat covers the current regime rather than older low-demand data. Sigma uses recent_N (N=7) to capture current demand volatility. These choices push the OR backend to raise the base stock toward recent demand while keeping lead-time assumptions aligned with confirmed arrivals, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand has settled well above historical (recent 5-week avg ~101 units vs historical ~59), on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. Lead time observed consistently 0 in conclues, so set L by observed average. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated regime (weeks 4\u20138 avg \u2248101) and recent variability; this focuses the base-stock on current higher demand and limits excess holding given holding cost $1.0 and profit $4.0.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-day arrivals (lead time observed = 0 each concluded period) and demand varying around ~100 in recent weeks with current on-hand=24, in-transit=0. No evidence of lost shipments or new sustained regime beyond previously recorded shift. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and full-sample demand baseline while avoiding overfitting to short-week noise, I use default lead time and default demand estimates so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) without creating excessive inventory given current on-hand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals were same-period) and demand has been higher than the Jan samples for many weeks (periods 4\u201310). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so orders must cover current + lead periods. I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use a recent_N window to capture the sustained higher-demand regime from Periods 4\u201310 (use last 7 periods to cover that regime while smoothing variability). I apply the same recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias base-stock toward the higher recent mean to avoid lost sales while the sigma choice increases safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and sustained higher demand since Period 1 with a recent uptick (P7-P11). Use L=default to trust confirmed 0-period arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the latest demand regime (periods P7-P11 mean ~122.8) so the OR backend builds base stock for the elevated demand while limiting exposure to older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed (Periods 1-11): avg demand = 111.0 vs historical avg = 59.2 (+88%)

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0. Demand has sustained a higher regime (Periods 1-11 avg ~111 vs historical ~59); I therefore set L to the observed average lead time=0 and use recent data to capture the new demand level and volatility. This ensures the OR backend targets a higher base-stock to meet the sustained elevated demand while sigma is estimated from the same recent window to reflect current variability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

No evidence of lost shipments. I keep L as default (promised 0) since observed lead times are consistently 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the confirmed elevated regime (use last 11 concluded demand samples), and set sigma_hat to recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR backend computes a base-stock that services the higher recent demand while capping orders to limit holding cost exposure.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 so keep promised lead time. Recent demand elevated vs long-run: last 5 concluded demands (P10-P14) = [125,183,117,133,141], recent mean \u2248139.8 vs historical mean \u224859.2; use recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher demand regime for the (1+L)-period forecast. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base-stock to improve service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while sigma estimation captures variability to avoid excessive overstock.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 each period (confirmed P1,P2,...), and a sustained demand regime shift to ~110+ units/week (carry-over: demand regime shifts confirmed through Period 12). To keep service for the higher-demand regime while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base forecasts on recent demand. I choose recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (uses the last 11 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent high-demand regime, balancing fill rate vs holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time previously confirmed as 0. Recent demand has been in a higher regime (~110 avg) vs historical (~59); to capture the sustained shift use recent data. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the last 11 periods where the higher demand regime is evident. This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts while capping orders via the backend cap to control holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show stable same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed) and a sustained demand regime shift (Periods 1-11 avg \u2248111 vs historical 59). I keep L = default (promised lead time = 0) because arrivals have consistently concluded with 0 LT. To capture the higher recent demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (uses the confirmed recent regime avg/volatility over Periods 1-11). This biases base-stock toward higher coverage to avoid stockouts given no pipeline stock and elevated demand, while sigma_hat recent_N captures realized variability to limit overstock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). Historical concludes show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand has shifted higher (carry-over confirms sustained regime with avg ~111 over P1\u2013P11 vs historical ~59). On-hand=78, in-transit=0. To reflect the sustained higher demand, set lead time based on observed lead times (calculate) and set forecast and volatility using the most recent regime (recent_N with N=11) so the OR backend targets service levels appropriate to the higher demand while avoiding excessive overstock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime since early periods (carry-over insights). To capture the elevated, sustained demand I set lead time to default (promised 0 / confirmed 0) and use recent_N=11 for demand mean and volatility to reflect the confirmed regime over the first 11-period shift and subsequent high demand through Period 19. This increases target base-stock to meet higher demand while the sigma estimate uses the same recent window to size safety stock appropriately, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1. On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (sustained). Recent demand (Periods 13-20 = 133,141,148,190,109,81,146,109) is higher and more variable than the older 2019-Jan samples, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because lead time has been consistently observed as 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=8) to reflect the last 8 periods' mean and volatility (scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively), balancing service level (capture elevated mean) against holding cost given existing on-hand stock and zero in-transit.

Recent demand has been in a higher regime (sustained since early periods through P21). To capture the confirmed 0 lead time use 'calculate' (avg observed). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N with N=11 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (use last 11 demand samples) so the OR engine raises the base-stock to avoid stockouts while still accounting for holding cost.

Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and a persistent higher-demand regime vs early historical samples. I keep L as default (promised 0). To capture the sustained elevated demand pattern while weighting recent behavior, I use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=20 (largest reasonable recent window) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent high-demand regime and stabilize orders against variability. This balances service (profit/higher fill) vs holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base stock using updated demand/volatility estimates.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29): on-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 for all observed orders (sustained). Recent demand has varied but no new sustained changepoint since prior recorded insights. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised/observed lead time and full historical demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overfitting to short-term noise while respecting the confirmed 0-period lead time and balances service level vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=74, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time=0 historically. Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = 73,56,92,78,60) is materially lower than the earlier high-demand regime; I will set lead time to promised default (0) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the downward shift and avoid excess holding cost. sigma will also use the last 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. These settings lower target base-stock vs earlier high-demand periods, balancing service level and holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (many arrivals same period). Recent demand (Periods 22-26) averages \u224872.8, noticeably below the earlier high-regime averages; no new sustained upward shifts. To track the recent lower demand regime while preserving the confirmed zero lead time, I set L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 periods (captures current summer demand ~73 units). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base-stock relative to the earlier high-regime policy, lowering holding costs while maintaining service for the observed recent demand pattern.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead time consistently 0 (orders arriving same period), and recent demand has cooled relative to earlier spikes. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since observed lead time remains 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest lower-demand regime (last 5 demands: P24-28) so mu_hat reflects current weekly demand (scaled by 1+L). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than longer-term high-variance periods. These settings keep orders sized to meet near-term demand while avoiding excess holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=29, In-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (many periods). Recent demand (Periods 26-30 = 78,47,57,44,40) is close to long-run sample mean; no new sustained regime shift detected. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed same-period arrivals and stable demand, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so base-stock is computed from full-sample mean and std. This avoids overreacting to short recent dips and balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while limiting extra holding cost given current positive on-hand.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. I set L=default (use promised 0). To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (captures the most recent stable downshift since Period ~27). This keeps the base-stock targeted to current demand and reduces holding cost risk while maintaining service.

To avoid excess holding cost given weak recent demand, set L to promised (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks.

Recent demand has dropped vs earlier high regime: last 5 period demands = [44,40,33,21,33], recent mean ~34.2 which is materially below the long-run mean (~59). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0, supported by sustained evidence) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent N=5 samples to capture the new lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk given holding cost >0.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent 5-week demand (Periods 30-34 = 40,33,21,33,35) shows a sustained downshift vs earlier high-demand regime. On-hand=7, in-transit=0 \u2014 below forecast. Set L=default since observed lead time has consistently been 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new low-demand regime ((1+L)*mean of last 5 = 32.4 units). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same 5-week window (std \u2248 6.99). These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the new lower demand while the OR backend will cap orders; they reduce overstock risk given holding cost=$1 and protect service against the immediate recent demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 30-34: recent avg = 32.4 vs prior confirmed avg = 111.0 (\u221270.8%), sustained 5 periods

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has dropped sharply since Period 30; last 6 demands (P30-35) average ~30.8 units. On-hand=16, in-transit=0, profit=4, holding=1. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods, so use promised lead time (default). To capture the new low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 6 periods (N=6) so the OR engine targets a much lower base stock and reduces excess holding while preserving service for current lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 30-35: recent avg demand = 30.8 vs prior confirmed avg = 111.0 (\u221272.2%), sustained 6 periods

I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime (N chosen = regime length 7, constrained by rules). This reduces target base-stock and caps orders to limit holding cost while preserving service for current lower demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has settled into the low regime observed from Period 30 onward (~30 units/week). On-hand=15, in-transit=0 \u2014 pipeline empty. I set L=default to use promised lead time 0 (confirmed historically). To align ordering with the sustained low-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand and volatility with N=8 (Periods 31-38) to reflect the most recent 8 weeks of behavior and avoid overstock; this keeps base_stock small and reduces holding cost while maintaining service. N=8 chosen because the low-demand regime has persisted for 8 periods (Periods 31-38). No explicit adjustment for missing shipments needed (no overdue arrivals).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has settled at a low regime since Period 30 (demands over P30-38 avg \u224826.3), on-hand=16, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and historical lead times consistently 0. To avoid overstock while preserving service, I use recent_N demand estimates focused on the low-demand regime (last 9 periods) and keep L as default (promised=0). This reduces target base-stock to match current lower demand and lowers holding cost risk.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has settled at a much lower regime since Period 30 (periods 30-39 mean \u224825.2 units). On-hand=20, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Historical lead times have consistently concluded as 0 periods; no overdue shipments. I select L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=10 (captures periods 30-39). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These settings shrink target base-stock to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for current lower demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in a low regime since ~Period 30 (periods 30-40 demands \u2248 [40,33,21,33,35,23,10,22,20,15,15]; recent mean \u2248 24). On-hand=19, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical observed lead times consistently 0 in concluded history. To target current low-demand regime I set lead time to the observed average and use recent_N (N=11) for demand mean and volatility to focus the forecast on the last 11 weeks (the low-demand regime), reducing excess holding while preserving service. These parameters help the OR engine compute a base-stock tuned to the sustained lower demand and the current zero lead time.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 30 (Periods 30-41 avg \u2248 30, more recently Periods 37-41 avg \u224816.8) and lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To reflect the persistent low-demand regime I use recent_N over the recent regime to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and std; keep L as default (promised=0) because concluded messages confirm lead time 0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been low since the late-September regime shift (Periods 30-36) and remained subdued in the last 6 periods (Periods 37-42 mean \u224821.2). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To align ordering with the recent low-demand regime while preserving service, I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 weeks (Periods 37-42), so the OR engine will target a smaller base-stock and limit holding costs given current low demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Recent demand has declined to a low regime (last 7 demands avg \u224819.4) vs earlier high-volume periods. On-hand=22, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Confirmed lead time=0 historically. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, use a short recent-window forecast (captures current low-demand regime) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. Chosen N=7 covers the most recent 7 weeks (Periods 37-43) showing the sustained low-demand pattern.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). History shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed across many concludes). Recent demand has fallen from the mid-100s earlier in the year to low tens; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 40-44) = 15, 12, 43, 9, 26 -> recent mean ~21. I therefore keep L as default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend will target a much lower base stock and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times remain 0 (consistent arrivals observed each period); no evidence of new lead-time delays. Recent demand has been lower than the earlier high regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 41-45) = [12, 43, 9, 26, 28], recent mean=23.6 over 5 periods, showing a sustained lower-demand regime. I set L to default (promised 0) since actual lead time continues to be 0 in concluded history. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current lower-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture recent demand volatility. This biases orders down to avoid excess holding cost given low on-hand inventory and no in-transit units, while still covering expected immediate demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (concluded P1..P46). Demand has been in the lower regime since ~Period 30 (recent weekly demands ~40\u219220s). To avoid excess holding while maintaining service, I keep L=default (promised 0, confirmed historically) and set demand estimates using recent_N over the low-demand regime (capture last 17 periods since the regime shift around Period 30). sigma_hat also uses recent_N to reflect reduced volatility in the recent regime. These parameters bias orders toward lower replenishment appropriate for sustained lower demand and lower variance, reducing holding cost while preserving service.
