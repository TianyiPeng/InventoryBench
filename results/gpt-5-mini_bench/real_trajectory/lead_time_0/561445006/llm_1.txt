Lead time / pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet; supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time unknown \u2014 cannot assume same-period arrival with certainty. Inventory trade-off: Profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period favors selling rather than overstocking. Order logic: Target one-week demand with a small safety buffer for potential Valentine uplift but avoid high holding cost and risk if orders are delayed.
