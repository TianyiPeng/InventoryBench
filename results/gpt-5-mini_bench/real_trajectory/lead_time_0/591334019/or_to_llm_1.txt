However Periods 25\u201327 show heavy censored demand (true demand > observed sales: P25 demand=25 sold13, P26 demand=47 sold15, P27 demand=79 sold50) indicating stockouts and that demand can spike well above the low regime. OR recommends 85 using promised L and long-history mean; that likely overstates typical demand but OR also helps guard against spikes. Decision: place a conservative replenishment of 50 units \u2014 equal to the recent arrival that sold out in P27 \u2014 to cover a likely near-term spike while limiting holding cost if demand reverts to the low regime. This balances the risk of lost sales from under-ordering (profit $4 > holding $1) with avoiding excessive inventory given the documented regime shift.
