Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-02-11. SKU has on-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Historical weekly samples (5): [154,119,124,88,117] -> mean ~120.4, std ~22.6. Promised lead time = 0 and no evidence to adjust. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given modest profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Historical weekly demand samples (Jan 2019) show mean ~120 units; Period 1 demand was 79 (ending on-hand 62, in-transit 0). One concluded arrival shows observed lead time 0 (P1 order arrived P1). No sustained changepoint in demand or lead time detected. Use default promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/SD and protects against typical variability while avoiding overfitting the single low recent sale.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded lead times = 0 (Period1, Period2). On-hand=9, in-transit=0; recent sales: 79 then 128 \u2014 demand around ~120/wk. To balance service vs holding cost I use recent 5-sample demand to capture current level while keeping promised lead time (0). This keeps base-stock anchored to recent mean and uses recent volatility for safety.

Daily Reward (R_t): $234.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand has been variable: Period1=79, Period2=128, Period3=72. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0, so use promised lead time. I set L to default (promised). To reflect the recent regime and rapid changes, I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat (captures average of the last 3 observed demands) and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. This balances service (respond to recent spike in Period 2) against holding cost given on-hand=54 and no in-transit inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $241.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows four consecutive same-period arrivals (Period1-4 orders arrived in same period) and no in-transit stock, on-hand=47. Demand history (provided samples) will be used as the baseline. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because concluded messages confirm actual lead time=0. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all provided samples, leveraging the full historical sample set for a stable forecast. This keeps the backend's base-stock and caps consistent with observed zero lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders placed P1-P4 all arrived same period in conclude messages).

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times (P1-P5) all 0 \u2192 set L by averaging observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 1-5) shows lower average than older samples, so forecast using the most recent 5 periods to capture the current regime for both mean and volatility. These parameters reduce excess safety stock while preserving service given confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-6) shows a downshift from early high weeks (128,79) to more recent lower weeks (46,46). On-hand=59, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments; confirmed lead time=0 in prior periods. To keep responsiveness to the recent downward demand while still using several weeks for stability, I use recent_N=6 for both demand mean and volatility so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 6 samples. Lead time stays at promised/default (0) matching observed arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $175.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Recent demand has declined sharply: Periods 5-7 demands = [46,46,55] (mean~49) vs earlier weeks much higher. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. I therefore use promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime (use recent_N with N=3). Sigma is also estimated from the same recent window to capture current lower volatility. This reduces over-ordering vs using the older higher-demand samples while preserving service for the current demand level.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01) show stable mean (~120.4) and moderate volatility (std ~23.5). Prior concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0. Given stable history and confirmed same-period arrivals, use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance. This keeps service-level driven by profit/holding cost while avoiding overfitting to recent low ending inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history shows stable same-period arrivals and variable weekly demand (recent demands: 79,128,72,72,46,46,55,52,23). On-hand=96, in-transit=0. No evidence of lost shipments or lead-time drift; confirm using promised lead time. Use default L to keep backend aligned with observed 0-period arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Recent demand has declined versus early-period (last 5 demands: 46,55,52,23,17; mean=38.6). On-hand=100, in-transit=0, confirmed lead time=0 in prior periods. To respond to the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the last 5 weeks. L uses default (promised 0) consistent with confirmed lead time. This reduces ordering to match lower demand and limits holding cost given high on-hand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P11) consistently show actual lead time = 0; recent weekly demand has been low/moderate (range ~16\u201379, recent 5 weeks: 16,17,23,52,55). Given confirmed zero lead time and no missing shipments, use promised/default lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service level vs holding cost with the provided profit/holding ratio.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201312 arrivals same period), on-hand=79, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has ranged ~16\u201379 with overall mean driven by all samples provided. Given confirmed 0-period lead time and no sustained demand regime shift, use defaults so backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This keeps orders responsive (same-period arrivals) while letting the OR engine balance profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=82, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P13) consistently show actual lead time = 0; no lost shipments recently. Current inventory comfortably covers expected near-term demand, so use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock conservative given stable same-period arrivals and holding cost > 0.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=94, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand (Periods 8-14) ranged ~13\u201352 with no sustained spike; prior conclude messages (Periods 1-14) consistently show actual lead time = 0. To keep parameters simple and consistent with observed lead time and stable/declining recent demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/std. This avoids over-ordering given current high on-hand and low holding cost tradeoff (profit $4 vs holding $1).

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=93, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P15) show consistent same-period arrivals; no overdue shipments. Demand has been moderate (recent weekly demand ~12\u201333). I keep L=default (promised 0) because lead time has been consistently observed as 0. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all sample data to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level (profit-driven fill) against holding cost given stable recent demand and zero pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=91, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P16) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Demand has been relatively low/stable in recent weeks (single-digit to low-double weekly sales). I set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) and let mu_hat/sigma_hat use default population estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from all samples. This preserves service with modest safety stock while avoiding excess holding given Profit=$4 vs Holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201317) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period), demand recent levels are low (~10\u201350/week) versus earlier higher winter samples. I therefore use the promised/default lead time (0) and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps forecasting anchored to full-sample statistics while respecting confirmed LT=0 and avoids overreacting to short recent fluctuations given adequate on-hand stock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concluded history shows stable same-period lead time (0) and modest, steady demand: historical sample mean = 120.4 units/week (samples: 154,119,124,88,117). On-hand=90, in-transit=0, so current inventory is below one-period typical demand; no overdue shipments observed. I choose L=default (use promised lead time 0, confirmed by concluded arrivals), mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean of all samples to center the base-stock on long-run average demand, and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes demand variability from the full sample. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given on-hand < mean) against holding cost by relying on the engine's z* calculation.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been low (many weeks <20 units), so keeping promised lead time and using default demand estimates lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this balances service level with holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=92, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed). Recent demand has declined markedly over the last 7 periods (Periods 14-20: demands = 13,12,11,12,8,2,2), indicating a lower-demand regime versus earlier weeks. To reflect the confirmed lead time and the recent lower-demand regime I keep L as promised (default) and use recent_N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability from the recent low-demand regime, reducing overstock while maintaining service.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=86, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201321) consistently show arrivals same period as orders (observed lead_time=0 across samples) and no lost shipments. I set L by 'calculate' to reflect the confirmed actual lead time = 0 derived from observed concludes. I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full sample history ((1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std) for demand and volatility; this leverages all data while the backend's service-level formula will balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost. No overdue or missing shipments to adjust for.

To avoid overstock while preserving service, keep L as default (promised=0) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (captures Periods 11\u201322 demand behavior).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Historical early-sample mean (~120/wk) collapsed to ~12/wk over the last 12 periods (Periods 12-23), a sustained downward demand regime. Lead time confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 to capture the new low-demand regime and its volatility so the OR backend targets much lower base-stock and avoids holding cost from overstocks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Periods 12-23 avg demand = 12.08/wk vs earlier sample mean = 120.4/wk (\u221290%), sustained for 12 periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift: Periods 12-23 average \u224812.08 units/week (vs earlier ~120.4), confirmed over 12 periods. On-hand=62, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time=0 and prior concludes confirm 0 LT. I set L to default (use promised 0). To reflect the new low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (capture the 12-period low-demand regime). This reduces orders to avoid high holding cost while preserving service for current low demand.

Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 12 (avg \u224812.08/wk) and lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). On-hand=37, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs current low demand but still order policy should reflect the new low-demand regime to avoid holding cost. Set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 12\u201325) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes a base-stock appropriate to the lower mean and observed variability, reducing excess inventory and balancing service vs holding costs.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (orders in P1-P26 arrived same period). A demand regime shift was detected at Period 24: Periods 12-23 avg \u224812.08/wk (vastly lower than earlier ~120/wk). Recent weeks (P12-P23) form the new low-demand regime; P24-P26 show some volatility but not a sustained new regime. To reflect the confirmed 0 lead time and the low-demand regime, set L=default so backend uses promised lead time (0). Use recent_N with N=12 for mu_hat to base the forecast on the 12-period low-demand regime (N chosen per detected regime length rules). Use recent_N with N=12 for sigma_hat to capture volatility in that same recent regime. This keeps target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while meeting the observed reduced demand and leverages the high profit/holding ratio (q\u22480.8) used by the OR engine for service level.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime from Periods 12-23 (avg ~12/wk) but demand rose in the last 3 periods (P25-27 = 25,47,79). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. Because recent demand has trended up sharply, I bias the forecast toward the very recent window to capture the current uptick while keeping lead time at the promised/observed 0. I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (captures P23-P27) so the OR engine will raise the base stock to meet higher near-term demand without assuming a long-term permanent shift.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times confirm promised L=0 (P1\u2013P28 arrivals all same-period). Demand showed a low regime earlier (Periods 12\u201323) but recent periods 24\u201328 show a sharp rebound (demands: 9,25,47,79,48). To adapt quickly to the recent upturn while keeping risk control, I set L=default (promised 0). I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 5 weeks \u2014 this captures the recent spike and higher volatility so the OR engine raises the base stock and cap to avoid stockouts while still accounting for holding cost tradeoff.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime from Periods 12-24, but demand surged in Periods 25-29 (25,47,79,48,48) \u2014 likely a short-term rebound or promotional spikes. On-hand=16, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0, so use default L to keep arrivals same-period. To capture the recent uplift while remaining responsive to volatility, set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks (Periods 25-29) so mu_hat uses recent_N N=5; likewise set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect current variability. This biases orders toward higher service during the recent spike while keeping holding cost sensitivity through the backend's z* calculation (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.8).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical lead time repeatedly confirmed as 0. Recent demand (Periods 25-30 = 25,47,79,48,48,130) shows a return to higher, volatile demand vs the earlier low-regime; therefore I use a recent window to capture current mean/volatility. Set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current demand regime and let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap accordingly.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand experienced a low regime from Periods 12-23, then a volatile recovery with a clear recent uptick: Periods 25-31 demands = [25,47,79,48,48,130,136]. To respond to this recent surge and avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind, I use the promised/default lead time (0) and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 7 weeks (Periods 25-31) to capture the current regime. This gives the OR engine a short L and a mu_hat that reflects recent higher mean demand, with sigma_hat reflecting recent variability so the backend's base-stock and cap computations balance service level vs. holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has jumped sharply since Period 30 (130,136,162) after a prolonged low regime (Periods 12-23 avg=12.08). Use promised lead time (0) and base forecasts focused on the recent high-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 (Periods 27-32) to capture the emerging high mean (mean of last 6 = 100.5) and volatility while avoiding dilution by the much earlier low regime. This balances service (capture current spike) vs holding cost by restricting estimation to the recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: Periods 27-32 avg demand = 100.5/wk vs prior low-regime avg = 12.08/wk (increase +~734%); sustained high demand in Periods 30-32 (130,136,162).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has shifted to a high regime starting around Period 30 (demands: 130, 136, 162, 307) and on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so stockouts likely without prompt replenishment. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (Periods 1\u201333). I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0). For demand forecasting I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201333) so mu_hat reflects the current elevated mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This biases the OR base-stock upward to reduce lost sales while keeping holding cost in mind given holding=$1 and profit=$4.

Promised lead time is 0 and historical concludes confirm lead time=0. To reflect the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent 5 periods (regime length=5).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has clearly stayed in the post-changepoint high regime (Periods 30-36: demands 130,136,162,307,180,188,126; recent 7-pt mean \u2248175.6). Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (multiple conclude messages). On-hand=113, in-transit=0; with L=0 we should size replenishment to the recent high-regime demand. I set L=default (promised/confirmed 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained high regime. For volatility I also use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent variability (including the large spike at P33). These parameters steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts during the confirmed high-demand regime while accounting for holding cost through the backend's z* cap.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Demand has stayed in the high regime since Period 30 (sustained high weekly sales, e.g. periods 30-37 mostly >> prior low regime). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 31-37 + Period 30) for both demand mean and volatility so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand centered on the new regime. L kept at default (promised 0) since concluded history confirms 0. This raises base-stock to avoid stockouts while accepting extra holding cost given strong ongoing demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has shifted to a sustained high regime since Period 30 (large weekly spikes; recent weeks 130\u2013307). On-hand=49, in-transit=0; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To reflect the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility using the most recent 9-week regime (Periods 31\u201339 window length=9) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. Lead time uses default (promised=0) since concluded history confirms 0 actual lead time. This balances service (capture high demand) against holding cost by basing base-stock on the recent high-demand samples.

Daily Reward (R_t): $395.00

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals in concluded periods) and a sustained demand regime shift upward starting at Period 30 (high demand since P30). On-hand=101, in-transit=0; pipeline is empty so orders must cover current-period demand. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201339, regime length=10) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 10 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 10 samples). This prioritizes service for the confirmed high-demand regime while keeping volatility estimated from the same recent window to avoid overstock from older low-demand data.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent P1\u2013P40). Demand has shifted to the high regime beginning at Period 30; recent weeks (Periods 30\u201340) avg \u2248165.5/week. To capture the sustained high-demand regime I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N for demand parameters: mu_hat recent_N N=11 (uses Periods 30\u201340 mean \xd7 (1+L)) and sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. No evidence of lost shipments; parameters prioritize service (higher mu_hat) while sigma_hat informs safety stock against variability.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=143, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 (arrivals in conclude messages always same period). Demand regime shifted up starting ~Period 30 (sustained higher weekly demand through Period 41). To capture the current high-demand regime I set L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=12 (regime length Periods 30\u201341 = 12) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 12 weeks) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(last 12 weeks). This keeps the base-stock tuned to the confirmed 0 lead time and the recent high-demand regime, balancing service level (use recent demand mean/variance) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime starting at Period 30 (Periods 30-42 high weekly demand; carry-over notes). Promised lead time = 0 and multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0. I bias forecast to the recent high-demand regime by using recent_N over the last 13 weeks (Periods 31-43 window covers the sustained high regime length ~13) so the OR backend targets service during this high-demand period while avoiding excess stock from older low-demand data. Using recent_N for sigma aligns variability to the same regime. Default lead time keeps promised 0 (confirmed).

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent demand returned to the high regime starting Period 30 (sustained high weeks P30\u2013P43). Lead time has been consistently 0 in all concluded periods (P1\u2013P43 arrivals matched same-period orders). I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead times (all zeros). For demand I use recent_N with N=14 to capture the current high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201343 = 14 weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the elevated demand while limiting inventory built from older low-demand data. No missing shipments observed; using recent_N prevents legacy low-regime dilution.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=142, in-transit=0. Lead time history (Periods 1-44) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (confirmed Period 5 insight). Demand experienced a sustained low regime (Periods 12-29) then a sustained high regime starting at Period 30 (Periods 30-44, recent avg elevated). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because multiple conclude messages confirm 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the high-demand regime (Periods 30\u201344 length=15) so the OR base-stock will reflect the elevated mean and volatility observed since the regime change. This balances a high service level (profit/holding => q=0.8) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the sustained high-demand regime and avoiding dilution by the earlier low regime.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P45 concludes). Demand moved to a sustained high regime starting around Period 30 (Periods 30\u201345 show elevated weekly sales vs the prior low regime). I set L to default (promised lead time = 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N over the most recent high-demand regime: regime length from Period 30\u201345 = 16, so N=16 (captures the current elevated mean and variability). This biases the OR base-stock toward meeting the higher sustained demand while the backend cap prevents extreme over-ordering, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=152, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed Periods 1-46). Demand experienced a sustained high-regime beginning around Period 30; to capture the current post-changepoint demand level I use a recent_N estimate over the high-regime window (Periods 30\u201346 => regime_length=17). Therefore: L=default to keep promised 0 (matches observed); mu_hat=recent_N N=17 to reflect (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 17 samples in the high-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N N=17 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These settings balance service (higher recent mean) against holding cost by using recent regime data rather than older, low-demand samples.
