Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time; use promised/default lead time. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean demand \u2248112.6 units/week; with no evidence of a regime shift or delayed shipments, use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost per unit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded arrival shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 1 (observed lead_time=0). Use lead time estimation from observed history (calculate). Demand history (5 samples mean\u2248112.6) used with default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps forecast tied to historical weekly demand while the confirmed lead time=0 lets the OR backend size single-period orders to cover expected demand without extra pipeline buffer.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two consecutive same-period arrivals (Period1 and Period2 orders both arrived with lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) because observed lead time matches promise. I set mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples (uses full sample mean ~112.6). This balances service level vs holding cost given no evidence of a demand regime change or delayed shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) mean=112.6. Recent observed demand (Periods 1-3 conclude) = {173,199,147} \u2192 recent mean=173, indicating a sustained upward shift. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (orders in P1,P2,P3 arrived same period). No overdue shipments. I set L using 'calculate' to confirm actual observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (3 most recent periods: 173,199,147). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the higher short-run demand while keeping safety stock aligned with recent variance; using concluded lead-time avoids over-ordering for non-existent delays.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: orders in P1/P2/P3 arrived same period); Demand regime shift beginning Period 1: avg increased from 112.6 to 173 (+53.6%) based on Periods 1-3

Daily Reward (R_t): $19.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent history: P1-3 showed a sustained higher-demand regime (173,199,147) vs historical mean ~112.6; P4 dropped to 96 but this is a single low period. On-hand=77, in-transit=0 so current coverage is low vs recent demand (~173/week). Promised lead time=0 and observed lead time confirmed 0 in concluded periods. To target the new demand regime I set L=default to use promised 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 1-3 mean \u2248173). For demand volatility I also use recent_N (N=3) so safety stock reflects variability in the recent regime. These parameters push the OR backend to set base_stock around the recent higher mean while respecting the capped order size.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 and a transient high-demand run (P1-P3) followed by two softer weeks (P4-P5). On-hand=47, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. To balance service vs holding (profit=holding so q=0.5 -> z=0), use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast use EWMA to blend the historical baseline and recent spikes (gamma=0.5) so the OR engine's base_stock reflects both regimes without overreacting to short blips. Use default sigma (sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples)) to let backend estimate variability from full history.

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded demands show a downward shift since Period 4 (P1-3: 173,199,147; P4-6: 96,101,92). On-hand = 23, in-transit = 0 so no incoming arrivals expected. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over; use promised/default L. To protect service but avoid excess holding given equal profit/holding (q=0.5 \u2192 neutral z), use recent demand estimates based on the most recent regime (Periods 4-6) to reflect the sustained lower demand. Thus set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 3 samples. This balances service vs holding given low pipeline and current on-hand.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands show a higher regime in Periods 1-3 (173,199,147) versus older baseline. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To protect service with minimal holding (profit=holding), set L to promised (0). Use recent_N for demand forecasts to capture the higher recent mean: use last 3 concluded demand samples (Periods 1-3) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher target base-stock to avoid stockouts while keeping variance estimate tied to recent regime.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 confirm lead time 0. Demand increased starting Period 1 (sustained higher regime through Period 8); use recent sample window to capture this new regime. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts using the recent higher-demand regime and recent volatility, balancing service (avoid stockouts given zero lead time) against holding cost by relying on observed recent demand rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent observed lead time remains 0 (concluded arrivals same period). On-hand=77, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history shows an early high regime (Periods 1-3 avg ~173) then a lower recent regime. I detect a downward shift in demand over the most recent 5 concluded periods (Periods 5-9), so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect current lower mean and volatility. I keep L at default (promised 0, confirmed). These parameters let the OR backend target stock for the current, lower-demand regime (avoiding excess holding cost) while using recent variance to size safety stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all arrivals same-period \u2192 actual lead time = 0 (consistent across multiple periods). Recent demand has softened vs early-period spike; using recent demand to set forecast reduces overstock risk given zero lead time and equal profit/holding cost. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest demand regime (last 5 periods) so the OR backend targets service with lower inventory and avoids excess holding.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent history shows lead time confirmed as 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 1 (early-period Jan samples vs. Periods1-11). On-hand=18, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue arrivals. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed =0). For demand I emphasize the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N over the last 11 observed weekly demands (Periods 1\u201311) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the current regime rather than the older Jan baseline. This raises target base-stock to protect service while the backend\u2019s cap limits excess orders, balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 1. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 12 samples to reflect current mean across review+lead). Sigma similarly uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock responsive to the new higher mean while using recent volatility to balance service vs holding costs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (P1-P13). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods P9-P13 = 53,53,67,157,57) has mean ~77.4 and moderate variability; no new sustained regime shift since prior carry-over. On-hand=57, in-transit=0 so orders must cover this period's demand after decision. I set L to calculate to reflect observed lead times=0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the recent dip/spike pattern (captures the 157 spike while smoothing), balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 -> moderate service target).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-05-20. On-hand=19, in-transit=0; recent history shows confirmed lead time 0 and volatile weekly demand with an earlier sustained upward regime. No current evidence of lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend uses full historical demand for forecast; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, which balances service vs holding given profit=holding ($1/$1).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed earlier) and no overdue shipments; on-hand=30, in-transit=0. Demand has been variable; last 5 demand observations (Periods 11-15) = [67,157,57,59,78], reflecting a recent lower-average regime versus the early spike. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (helps avoid overstock from earlier spikes). This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to current demand while the lead time assumption matches observed deliveries.

Recent weeks (Periods 12-16) show lower demand vs earlier peak; to reflect current regime I forecast using the most recent 5 samples to keep orders responsive and avoid excess holding (profit=holding \u2192 conservative service level).

Historical concluded data show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and volatile demand; recent weeks (P13-17) show mixed low then one high spike. No new sustained regime change since prior insight. To balance service vs. holding cost I use a short recent window to capture current demand level while limiting exposure to the single spike: keep L as default (promised 0). Use recent_N with N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the base-stock on the recent 5-week mean and variability.

Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so keep L=default. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to anchor base-stock to the most recent demand regime and avoid overweighting early-sample priors. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility for safety stock calculation. These choices balance service (react to recent spikes) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Recent demand has been elevated and variable (many weeks ~150\u2013180), so I bias forecasts to recent observations rather than the long-run Jan samples. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime using the last 5 demand samples, improving service while limiting excess holding given equal profit/holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 across many periods and an elevated demand regime vs. the very early seed samples. No recent evidence of lost shipments or renewed changepoint. Use promised/default lead time and population statistics so backend computes (1+L)*mean demand and sqrt(1+L)*std. This yields a base-stock that reflects the long-run observed demand while the OR engine's cap limits order size to control holding cost versus service.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). Demand has been elevated recently (many weeks with demand ~150-200; recent concluded demands: P14-P23 contain multiple weeks >150 and series P17-P23: 178,153,173,200,177,148,160). To reflect the recent higher-demand regime I set lead time to default (promised 0) and use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the last-10-week mean/volatility (captures the higher recent demand while keeping responsiveness to shifts). This balances service level (reduce stockouts during sustained higher demand) vs holding cost by using a recent-sample forecast rather than the long-run mean.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=4, in-transit=0; recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed). Demand has been elevated vs the initial sample set (historical concludes), but no new short-term regime change since last insight. Given symmetric profit and holding ($1/$1 \u2192 q=0.5, z*=0) the OR backend's base-stock equals the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast; use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps orders aligned to the long-run observed mean, preserves service while avoiding extra holding given current low on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show confirmed actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals each period). Demand has been in a higher regime (~~170) for many periods since early runs. No overdue shipments to reconcile. I set L to default (promised=0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the last 20 demand samples to estimate mean and volatility across the review+lead period). This raises target base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability; together they balance service level (profit=holding => q=0.5) against holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 periods (consistent arrivals each period). Recent demand has settled at a higher level (many weeks in a ~120-180 range); to capture the current regime I use a recent-window forecast. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0). Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 12 demand observations, capturing the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short spikes. Use recent_N (N=12) for sigma_hat to estimate volatility from the same recent window so safety stock reflects current variability. These choices keep the OR engine's base_stock responsive to the elevated, sustained demand while avoiding overreaction to isolated weeks; default lead time leverages confirmed same-period arrivals.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, and recent weeks show sustained higher demand versus the very early samples. To ensure the OR engine targets current elevated demand while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observations, set L to promised (default). Use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples, capturing the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variance. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the recent regime rather than older low-demand weeks.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 1 (recent weekly demand mostly ~120\u2013160). To keep service vs holding balanced with profit=holding, use promised lead time (default=0) and base demand/volatility estimates from the most recent data window to reflect current regime. I select recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight recent patterns while smoothing noise; this supports the OR engine producing a base-stock that meets (1+L) periods of expected demand without excessive inventory given holding cost parity.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 consistently (Periods 1-29 arrivals all same period). Recent demand (Periods 25-29 = 126,156,151,133,113) shows a moderate level (~135) compared with earlier spike claims; to keep forecast responsive I use a recent-N mean. Set L to default (promised = 0) since concluded history confirms 0 lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands, capturing most recent regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility and keep safety stock aligned with recent variability. This balances service (using recent demand evidence) against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 => moderate service target).

To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), use promised/default lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the base-stock to the most recent demand regime (reduces carryover of earlier high-demand weeks and lowers unnecessary safety stock). This balances service vs. holding given equal profit/holding costs.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has fallen from earlier highs; last 5 observed demands = [133,113,116,95,61], average \u2248103.6. To react to the recent lower-demand regime while still capturing recent volatility, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the backend uses the mean of the last 5 periods (captures recent downshift). I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices reduce overstock risk given current on-hand=61 and no in-transit while keeping service against recent demand patterns.

Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; keep L=default to reflect promised lead time. To capture the recent demand regime and volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (focus on the most recent 8 demand samples to adapt to current mean/variance).

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u201336) consistently show actual lead time = 0 and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 1 (already recorded). Given stable same-period arrivals and no evidence of new changepoints in demand or lead time, use conservative defaults so the OR backend uses full historical mean/variance. This keeps base-stock aligned with observed demand while avoiding needless extra safety stock (profit=holding so service quantile = 0.5). Default params also handle the lack of pipeline (on-hand only 1) so backend will replenish toward the computed base stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (orders in P1\u2013P37 arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. Demand recently centered around ~120\u2013150 units with variability; to focus the forecast on the most recent behavior I use the last 20 samples for mean and volatility to set mu_hat and sigma_hat, which balances service vs holding given profit=holding ($1/$1). This keeps the OR engine responsive to recent demand while relying on confirmed L=0.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent concluded history (Periods 1-38) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 and demand samples vary around recent means ~120-150 with occasional spikes. On-hand=9, in-transit=0 => low cover vs typical weekly demand (risk of stockout this period). Promised lead time remains 0 and prior carry-over confirmed same-period arrivals; therefore use L=default to let backend assume promised lead time. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from all historical samples, which keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while preserving the backend's service-level tradeoff given profit=holding (q=0.5). This choice is conservative given no new sustained regime change and the confirmed 0 lead time; it ensures the backend replenishes toward the historical average while avoiding explicit overreaction to single-period variability.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Confirmed lead time = 0 from prior concludes. On-hand=16, in-transit=0 so no incoming coverage; recent demand has moderated compared with early spike. Use L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (Periods 35-39 demands: 107,121,153,129,107 -> mean \u2248121.4) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and keeps orders aligned with current demand. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than older samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts with up-to-date mean/variance) against equal profit/holding cost (q=0.5 favors median safety).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0; recent demand stabilized around prior elevated regime. No evidence of new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time. Use default lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period delivery and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over all samples). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock grounded in full-sample statistics while accounting for confirmed same-period arrivals and avoiding overfitting to short-term fluctuations.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent history (Periods 1\u201341) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed) and demand samples spanning Feb\u2013Nov with no new sustained regime shift since prior insight. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current-period demand. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with concluded arrivals. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast and volatility estimate; with profit=holding the service quantile is 0.5, so this balances fill rate vs. inventory cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals every period). Recent demand: single large spike in Period 42 (demand=385) likely holiday-driven but not yet a sustained regime change. To protect service for the upcoming week while avoiding excessive holding, use L=default (promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to let the OR engine weight the most recent demand (including the spike) over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Use sigma_hat=default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set. This balances short-term service risk from the recent spike against holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9. On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent demand shows elevated levels (last 5 concluded demands: 107,117,126,385,111; mean\u2248169) and a large Black Friday spike (P42=385) that should be partially reflected but not overweighted. Set L=default to reflect confirmed 0-period arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current demand regime while smoothing the single extreme event, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. With profit=holding, the OR backend uses z*=0, so mu_hat is the main driver of base-stock; this choice balances service (keeping stock after the recent high demand) against holding cost.

Recent demand shows a large one-period spike (Period 42 demand=385) but the last several weeks (Periods 34\u201344) otherwise hover ~100\u2013140; avoid overreacting to the single spike. No overdue shipments observed. Set L to default (use promised 0). For mu_hat use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent regime while diluting the isolated spike. Use default sigma_hat (population std of all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to keep variability estimates stable.

On-hand=29, in-transit=0 so we should replenish to cover same-period demand. Set L=default to use promised 0. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to capture the recent high-demand regime (captures holiday/late-year uplift). Keep sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L).
