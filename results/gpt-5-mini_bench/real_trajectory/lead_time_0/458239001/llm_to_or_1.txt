Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) shows mean \u224852.2 units and moderate variability; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals so no evidence of lead-time shifts or regime change. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples\u2014this balances service vs. holding cost given no sustained signal to deviate.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent concluded history shows an order in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=0; no evidence of delays or lost shipments. Historical weekly samples (48,47,38,61,67) give mean=52.2 and std\u224810.42. On-hand=1, in-transit=0 so available supply is negligible. I choose default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/std to set base-stock and caps, balancing service (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to limited recent noise.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Concluded history shows two confirmed zero-period lead_time arrivals (orders placed P1 and P2 both arrived with lead_time=0). Demand has increased in the most recent two periods (62,70) versus earlier historical weekly series (48,47,38,61,67), suggesting a recent upward shift but only 2 periods of higher demand\u2014insufficient for a sustained 3+ period regime confirmation. I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead times (backend will compute average; observed = 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to bias the forecast toward the recent higher demand while still including one earlier sample for stability; this yields (1+L)*mean of the last 3 demand samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. This balances higher service level to avoid stockouts given recent demand uptick while limiting holding cost by keeping N small and relying on observed 0 lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $280.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P3) show same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and rising demand: sold 62, 70, 76. Historical sample mean (Jan) ~52.2, recent mean (last 3 weeks) = 69.33 (+33%). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N=3 to capture the clear upward regime (gives (1+L)*mean of latest 3 demands \u2248 69.33). For volatility I use recent_N=3 so the backend measures recent std dev (captures recent variability). These choices raise target base-stock to cover the sustained demand increase while recognizing lead time remains 0, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3); Demand regime shift: recent 3-period avg=69.33 vs prior sample avg=52.2 (+33%), sustained over 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $239.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent demand elevated: last 3 demands = [70,76,63], recent mean = 69.67 (\u2248+33% vs prior overall mean). On-hand 13, in-transit 0 \u2014 insufficient vs expected (1+L)*mean \u224869.7, so we need replenishment. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 in concluded periods; use promised lead time (default). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the confirmed upward regime (3-period sustained shift) so the OR engine computes base stock reflecting the new higher mean and short-term volatility.

Daily Reward (R_t): $304.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals in Periods 1-5 matched orders). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead demand. Demand has shifted up recently: last 3-sample avg = 69.33 vs prior overall avg ~52.2 (+33%), sustained for 3 periods. Profit/holding (4/1) implies a high target service level, so I prioritize recent demand regime. Therefore: keep L at default (promised 0, supported by observed arrivals), set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher mean, and set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This combination raises the base-stock to meet increased demand while accounting for holding cost tradeoff.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (P1\u2013P6 arrivals same-period). Demand shows a sustained upward regime since Period 4: recent 3-period demands (P4\u2013P6)=63,78,86 \u2192 avg=75.67 which is ~45% above the earlier sample avg (52.2); use recent data to capture this higher demand. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new regime and avoid understocking; this increases the base-stock and the safety stock to balance the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has accelerated (last 3 demands = 78,86,94; mean=86) and on-hand/in-transit = 0 so we must cover imminent demand. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 periods. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (protect service level against stockouts given profit>holding). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded demands show a clear sustained upward regime since Period 5 (Period5-8 demands: 78,86,94,109). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in earlier periods). I set L to default (use promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 5-8 avg=91.75) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 4 samples. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=4 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This raises base-stock to meet the higher service-level implied by profit/holding tradeoff while keeping variability estimation tied to the recent spike, which helps avoid chronic stockouts given zero lead time and no pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 5: prior avg ~52.2 -> recent Period5-8 avg=91.75 (+75.8%), sustained 4 periods

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 and a demand regime shift beginning Period 5 (higher weekly demand ~92 over P5-8). Recent demands: P5-8 high (regime_length=4) then P9 fell to 54 with large ending inventory. To respect the confirmed short lead time and recent high-demand regime while avoiding excess holding, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the P5-8 high-demand regime (N chosen per detected regime_length=4, satisfying min 3). This increases target base-stock to service the higher demand observed while sigma from the same recent window sets safety appropriately, balancing profit-driven service level (q=0.8) against holding cost given current inventory position and zero in-transit units.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=9, in-transit=0; recent history shows confirmed lead time=0 (consistent arrivals P1\u2013P10). Demand elevated since Period 5 with higher mean and volatility; to capture the recent regime I use recent_N over the last 6 demand periods (Periods 5\u201310) so mu_hat reflects current demand and sigma_hat captures recent variability. L set to calculate to lock in observed lead time=0 while allowing backend to compute average from observed lead times. This balances service (higher mu to avoid stockouts) against holding cost by using recent data rather than the full-history mean.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 (orders arriving same period). Demand has been elevated since Period 5; to reflect the recent higher regime while smoothing older low samples, I use recent_N over the last 5 demand observations (Periods 7-11) to set demand forecast and volatility. This keeps base stock responsive to the sustained higher demand and helps avoid stockouts while limiting excess holding cost given holding/profit ratio.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 5 (higher demand through most recent periods). I set L using observed data (calculate). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 5\u201312) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep service high for the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding by using recent-regime stats.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. No overdue shipments; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (P1-P13). Demand has been volatile with prior regime increases, but most recent 5-week mean (Periods 9-13 = 54,97,118,74,36) = 75.8 units. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 => target fill high but avoid excess stock), use promised lead time (0) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the current regime while smoothing short spikes. Methods chosen: L=default (use promised 0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to forecast (1+L)*recent mean; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent variability for safety stock calculation.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and recent demand volatility: Periods 11-14 demands = [118,74,36,50] (recent 4-period average = 69.5) which is below the earlier spike but still above the original sample mean (~52.2). To balance service level (profit $4) versus holding cost ($1), I use promised lead time (confirmed 0) and set demand forecast to the recent 4-period regime to adapt to the latest observed shift while keeping safety stock responsive to volatility. Thus: L=default, mu_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to target (1+L)*recent mean, and sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent variability for safety stock sizing.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (consistent P1-P15). Recent demand has dropped versus the earlier high regime: last 3 realized demands = [36,50,53], recent mean ~46.33. To avoid excess holding cost given current on-hand and lower recent demand, set L to default (promised 0, confirmed) and forecast demand using the most recent 3 periods. Use recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock reflecting the current lower-demand regime while sigma reflects recent volatility.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (sustained observa\xadtions through Period 16). Recent demand shows variability but the major regime shifts were already recorded in carry-over; no new sustained changepoint detected. Use default lead time (promised=0) so OR backend treats arrivals same-period. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine's capped policy balance service-level vs holding cost given the validated lead-time and full-sample demand statistics.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has shifted up starting Period 5 and persisted; to capture the higher recent regime I use recent_N based forecasts covering the post-changepoint regime (Periods 5\u201317, regime length 13). Therefore: L=default to keep lead time=0; mu_hat=recent_N with N=13 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the 13-period high-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=13 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to meet elevated demand while keeping holding exposure aligned to recent variance.

No shipments are overdue. I set L to default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 0-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent demand regime (captures the recent elevated demand) so the OR backend raises the base stock to improve service while the capped order limits exposure to holding cost given profit=$4 vs holding=$1.

Demand has shown a higher recent level vs the long-run; to be responsive I use a recent_N demand estimate over the last 8 observed demand periods (Periods 12-19) to capture the current regime while smoothing single-period spikes. L kept as default (promised = 0). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat makes the backend base-stock responsive to the recent higher mean/variance, balancing service (profit-driven q=0.8) against holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has been volatile with recent large spikes (Periods 19-20) but no new sustained regime of 3+ periods beyond previously recorded shifts; therefore use an EWMA to bias the demand forecast toward recent periods while retaining longer-run information (gamma=0.3). For volatility, use recent_N over the last 8 demand samples to capture recent variability including the spikes. These choices keep the backend base-stock responsive to recent increases without over-committing inventory given holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (notable sustained regime shift starting Period 5); on-hand=161, in-transit=0 so we have coverage for ~1\u20132 high-demand periods but no pipeline. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use observed-based L. Use a recent_N forecast to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the regime since Period 5 \u2192 length=17 periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets a base-stock reflecting the new higher mean and higher variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent large spikes in weeks 19\u201320) against holding cost given current large on-hand position.

Recent demand is volatile but elevated: last 8 demands (P15-P22) average = 115.75 units. I choose L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the latest elevated/volatile regime (keeps orders responsive to recent spikes while smoothing older low-demand periods). This will raise the base-stock to meet recent higher demand while sigma from the same window captures increased variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. On-hand=110, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (multiple periods). Recent demand (Periods 21-23 = 108,76,58) is lower than the large spikes earlier; to be responsive to the most recent regime and avoid excess holding, set lead time to default (promised 0) and base demand forecast on the last 3 observed weeks. Choose recent_N N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets ~80.7 units demand (1+L multiplier =1) and captures recent volatility rather than long-term higher-variance samples. This balances service (cover immediate demand) against holding cost given sizable on-hand inventory and zero in-transit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times confirm actual lead time = 0. Recent demand (last 4 concluded periods P21-24) = [108,76,58,94], mean=84 units \u2014 this reflects the current demand level after prior regime shifts and is most relevant for immediate ordering. To keep safety stock aligned with recent demand and avoid excess holding from older high-volume periods (e.g., P19-21 spikes), I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize serving current demand while limiting holding cost given limited on-hand inventory.

Use L=default since lead time has been consistently observed as 0.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 22-26) = [76,58,94,69,27], recent 5-week mean = 64.8 units/week. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed 0 in history). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat so the OR engine targets the current lower post-spike demand regime (1+L times recent mean \u2248 64.8). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect short-term demand volatility rather than older high-variance samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts from remaining mid-season variability) against holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory and no in-transit units.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=68, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=0 (sustained). Recent demand (Periods 25-27 = 69,27,18) shows a pronounced drop vs earlier spikes; using a short recent window captures current low demand and prevents overstock given holding cost. I set L=default to trust confirmed 0 LT. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (mean=38 units). This reduces ordering toward current lower demand while preserving responsiveness if demand rebounds.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/08/26). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Recent demand has dropped sharply over the last 3 weeks (P26-28: 27, 18, 17). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default L to let backend assume 0. To react quickly to the apparent new low-demand regime, forecast demand using the most recent 3 observations: set mu_hat recent_N N=3 and sigma_hat recent_N N=3 so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 periods and matching recent volatility. This keeps inventory aligned with the new lower demand while avoiding excess holding cost given current on-hand stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: recent avg (P26-28)=20.67 vs prior avg (P22-25)=74.25 (\u221272.1%), sustained 3 periods

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 (arrivals in concluded periods). Demand regime dropped starting Period 26 (P26-29 demands = 27,18,17,27; recent avg=22.25 vs prior higher regimes). No evidence of lost shipments. I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new low-demand regime (use the most recent 4 periods to estimate mean and volatility) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and uncertainty accordingly, avoiding excess holding while preserving service for the current lower demand.

Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 26 (demands: P26-30 = 27,18,17,27,6), so forecast and uncertainty should reflect the recent low regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods, so use observed average. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods to capture the new low-variance regime and avoid overstock. These parameters reduce holding cost risk while meeting near-term demand.

Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift down starting Period 26 (recent low demand). I choose L=default to trust the promised/observed 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the post-Period-26 low-demand regime (Periods 26-31) so mu_hat reflects the lower (1+L)-period mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility; this reduces over-ordering and holding cost while maintaining service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show lead time consistently 0. Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 26 (P26-32 demands: 27,18,17,27,6,16,14 \u2014 7 periods). I therefore keep L as default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use recent_N over the last 7 periods to capture the new low-demand regime (reduces overstock risk). I also use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to reflect lower recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward much smaller base-stock and tighter caps, preserving profit while minimizing holding cost given low recent demand and no in-transit stock.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows the low-demand regime that started around Period 26 has persisted through Periods 26\u201333 (demands: 27,18,17,27,6,16,14,28). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To match the current low-demand regime I use recent_N=8 (the 8 most recent samples) for demand mean and std. Keeping L as default (promised lead time=0) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm same-period arrivals. These parameters let the OR backend size the base-stock to current lower demand while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1).

Historical concluded lead times remain 0 (consistent arrivals each period), and there is a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 26 (Periods 26-35 show reduced demand vs earlier). I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-Period-26 low-demand regime (use last 10 concluded samples, Periods 26-35). I apply the same recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias orders toward the lowered demand level, reducing holding cost while maintaining service in the new regime.

=== Period 36 Summary ===
458239001: ordered=25, arrived=25 units (ordered on Period 36, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=26, demand=10, sold=10, ending on-hand inventory=16
Daily Profit: $40.00, Daily Holding Cost: $16.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $24.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 26 (sustained low-demand from P26\u2013P36). On-hand=16, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time previously confirmed as 0. I set L to default (promised 0). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent 11 samples (P26\u2013P36) to capture the regime length. Both mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N N=11 so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 11 demands, balancing service vs holding cost given low recent demand and current small on-hand stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed). Demand regime dropped starting Period 26 (periods 26-28 avg=20.67 vs prior ~74.25, sustained); recent low-demand regime persisted through Periods 26-37 (regime length ~12). I choose L=default to trust the promised/observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (reduces target base-stock and volatility so we avoid excessive holding cost while keeping reasonable service). This balances profit vs holding cost given current low demand and small on-hand position.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand has moved to a lower regime since Period 26 (sustained low weekly sales ~10\u201325). No shipments overdue. I set L to default to use the promised lead time (0), and use recent_N for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) to reflect the sustained low-demand regime. I choose N=13 to cover the recent low-demand window (Periods 26\u201338) so the backend base-stock and cap reflect the current lower mean and reduced variance, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for the observed regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Historical concludes show actual lead time repeatedly 0 (confirmed P1..P39), so keep promised/default L. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 26 (carry-over noted); recent demand (Periods 37-39 = 12,16,13) is ~13.7 units. To reflect the recent low regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures current mean/volatility and keeps the base-stock lean to limit holding cost). No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed repeatedly). Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 26 (sustained drop); I therefore use a recent-window forecast to capture the low, stable demand over the past ~15 weeks. L set to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals uniformly indicate 0 lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=15 (captures Periods 26\u201340 demand behavior) so the OR backend builds a base-stock tuned to the current low-demand regime and avoids excess holding while preserving service given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. Recent demand since Period 30 is in a lower regime (mostly single- to low-double digits) and appears stable for ~12 periods, so I forecast using the recent 12 samples to capture the current low-demand regime. I therefore keep L as default (promised 0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 to bias the base-stock toward the current lower demand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019/12/2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (confirmed earlier). Demand shifted down around Period 26 and the low-demand regime has persisted (P26\u2013P42). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=17 (covering Periods 26\u201342) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the current low-demand regime. This reduces base-stock size vs. using the full-sample mean and balances service level against holding cost given zero on-hand and no in-transit units.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (confirmed in earlier periods). Recent demand (Periods 41-43 = 10,57,57) suggests a short recent regime with mean ~41.3 units; I will target the immediate recent regime to avoid overstock given holding cost. Set L by calculating observed lead times (keeps L=0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the latest demand level for the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) so variability reflects the small-sample recent regime and keeps safety stock moderate. These choices prioritize matching current demand while limiting holding costs given zero pipeline and confirmed same-day arrivals.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand shows variability but no new sustained 3+ period regime shift since prior carry-over insights. To keep the OR backend calibrated to observed, set L to default (promised 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) because no significant new demand regime or lead-time change is confirmed and on-hand + pipeline are adequate to cover near-term demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 42-45 = 57,57,16,20) shows a lower, volatile regime versus mid-year spikes; no new sustained multi-period shift beyond this volatility. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (multiple concluded arrivals). To react to the latest short-run demand while keeping service for recent spikes, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 4 weeks (captures current lower/volatile demand pattern) so the OR backend will compute a base-stock appropriate to current demand and avoid excess holding given holding cost >0.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed Periods 1-46). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since around Period 26; the last ~20 samples reflect the current lower mean and volatility, so use a recent-window forecast to capture this regime. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed=0). Use mu_hat recent_N N=20 and sigma_hat recent_N N=20 so the OR backend builds base-stock and caps from the demand regime evidenced in the last 20 periods, avoiding overstock from older high-demand periods while reflecting current variability.
