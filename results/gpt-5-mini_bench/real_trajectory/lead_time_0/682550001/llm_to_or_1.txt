Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals so actual lead time unknown. Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean=56.8, notable spike week=110 causing elevated variance. Given sparse history and no late/ lost shipments evidence, use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so backend uses full-sample mean/std. This balances service (cover typical weekly demand) vs holding cost while awaiting evidence of regime or lead-time shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Historical weekly demand mean \u224856.8 (samples: 45,45,110,34,50). Period 1 order (P1) arrived in P1 => observed lead time = 0. On-hand=70, in-transit=0; on-hand already covers ~1 week average demand. Use promised/default lead time (0) confirmed by observed arrival. Use default demand/volatility estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so backend computes base-stock consistent with long-run sample stats and high service level implied by profit/holding ratio (q=19/20=0.95). This avoids placing an unnecessary order while letting OR engine set safety stock from observed variability.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows two observed arrivals with lead_time=0 (Period1 and Period2). No sustained demand regime change detected (historical samples mean ~56.8; recent period demands 37,47 show no persistent shift). To reflect observed lead time, set L via observed average. Use default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) since no clear changepoint; this balances service level with holding cost given modest on-hand inventory and low holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $884.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed demand (periods 1-3 sells: 37, 47, 49) is materially below the older sample mean (56.8), so I adopt a recent-window forecast to avoid overstock. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Chosen L method uses observed lead times (calculate) => 0. mu_hat uses recent_N N=3 to set (1+L)\xd7mean of the three most recent demands (captures current lower regime). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent demand volatility. This reduces order quantities vs. historical mean, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $745.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand 15, in-transit 0. Recent concluded demands (Periods 1-4) show stable weekly demand around 37-49 (P1=37, P2=47, P3=49, P4=40). Lead times observed in concluded history are consistently 0. To keep the base-stock tuned to the most recent regime, set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 0). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last 4 weeks of realized demand (captures current lower/steady demand vs. older 45/45/110/34/50 samples). This balances service (captures recent mean) against holding cost by avoiding inflation from older high spike (110).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1-P4 orders arrived same period).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history shows steady weekly demand samples [45,45,110,34,50] (mean=56.8) and lead time confirmed as 0 in multiple concludes. On-hand=19, in-transit=0; with same-period replenishment confirmed, use promised/confirmed lead time 0. Use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects full historical mean while letting the OR engine apply the profit vs. holding cost tradeoff.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands (P1-P6): 37,47,49,40,34,63 \u2014 a notable uptick in P6 suggests more weight on recent data. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods, so use promised lead time. Use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to bias forecast toward recent demand while retaining history. Keep sigma_hat as default (uses full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overfitting volatility from a single high week. These settings aim to raise target stock moderately for higher recent demand while limiting extra safety stock from transient noise, balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead times = 0 each concluded period) and no in-transit inventory; on-hand=48, in-transit=0. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses the observed lead-time average (confirming 0). Demand history samples show baseline weekly demand ~57 units; using 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, producing a base-stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost while reflecting observed zero lead time and full visibility of arrivals. This avoids overreacting to recent week-to-week noise while ensuring coverage for current-period demand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 confirmed short lead time. Recent demand shows a pickup in last 3 periods (periods 6-8 demands = 63,43,76; recent mean \u2248 60.7 vs longer-run mean \u2248 47). To react to this sustained uptick while keeping holding cost low, set L to calculated (uses observed lead times=0) and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the new higher mean and volatility over the latest regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-9) averages ~49.3 with noticeable variability (values: 37,47,49,40,34,63,43,76,55). Prior seed samples (Jan) are higher mean (~56.8) but recent 9-period window better reflects current trend. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in carry-over), so use default promised lead time. I select recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime, keeping base-stock responsive while limiting excess holding cost given Profit=$19 vs Holding=$1. This balances service level (by capturing recent demand mean/volatility) against holding costs and accounts for no in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has been lower than early samples; last 5 demands (P6-P10) = [63,43,76,55,26], mean=52.6. On-hand=46, in-transit=0 \u2192 limited pipeline. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest regime (5-week window) so the OR engine targets a base-stock around current demand levels while avoiding excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded deliveries confirm actual lead time = 0 (recorded in carry-over). No sustained demand regime change detected in recent history. I therefore use promised/default lead time so the OR engine uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)-scaled mean and sqrt(1+L)-scaled std; this balances service level vs holding cost while respecting confirmed same-period arrivals.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent realized lead times have been consistently 0 (confirmed in history through Period 12). Current on-hand=29, in-transit=0, no arrivals visible this period. Demand history (Periods 1\u201312) shows variable weekly demand (recent weeks: 54,29 ending inventory after sales), but no sustained regime shift. Given confirmed 0 lead time and no evidence of a demand structural change, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full-sample mean/variance. This balances service level (uses all available demand history) against holding cost given modest holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent demand (Periods 9-13 = 55,26,38,54,40) centers ~42.6 units/week with moderate variability. On-hand=42, in-transit=0 so current stock ~1 week of demand. Promised lead time and concluded history consistently show 0-period actual lead time, so use default lead time. To capture the recent regime and avoid overweighting older Jan-Feb samples, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 periods). Match sigma to recent variability with recent_N (N=5). These choices keep the base-stock responsive to current demand while the OR backend will apply the service-level cap given profit/holding tradeoff (high q\u22480.95), balancing fill rate vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data (Periods 1-14) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history (weekly samples provided) is the primary forecast; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) with modest holding cost by letting OR engine pick z*.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed earlier) and stable weekly demand (historical sample mean=56.8). Current on-hand=37, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments to reconcile. Use L=default to keep promised 0 (confirmed by past concludes). Use mu_hat=default to rely on full-sample mean scaled by (1+L) for the review+lead period, reflecting typical weekly demand. Use sigma_hat=default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L); this balances service level (driven by profit/holding tradeoff) against carrying cost given moderate on-hand stock and steady demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a spike (Period16 demand=82) but last 5 concluded demands average ~50.2 with elevated variance; prior carry-over confirmed lead time = 0. To balance service vs holding cost I use recent demand (most relevant) so mu_hat and sigma_hat are computed from the last 5 observed demands to capture the recent regime and volatility; L uses default (promised) which matches confirmed lead time=0. This raises target base-stock to cover the recent higher mean while sigma based on recent 5 captures increased variability.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and stable weekly demand with occasional spikes (not sustained). On-hand=40, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm actual lead time from observed concludes (all observed = 0). I use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a balanced base-stock that reflects full history while the capped order prevents excessive ordering. This keeps service level appropriate given demonstrated 0 lead time and avoids extra holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=42, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples\u2014this balances service level using full-sample statistics while keeping holding costs moderate given confirmed same-period replenishment.

On-hand=48, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history (weekly samples provided) shows stable weekly variability without a sustained regime shift. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps parameters grounded in full-sample estimates, balancing service (using observed L=0) against holding cost given modest holding penalty ($1/unit).

Past concluded history (Periods 1\u201320) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier), and recent weekly demands are moderate (no sustained new regime). With adequate on-hand stock and no evidence of a demand step-change, use default lead time and demand stats so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample history.

To keep the OR engine's base-stock calculation aligned with long-run demand and the confirmed same-period arrivals, use default lead time and default demand moments so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances fill-rate (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding overfilling given current on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Historical weekly demand has been stable around mid-30s to mid-50s recently with no sustained regime shift; prior carry-over already confirmed lead time = 0. No overdue shipments. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since concluded history supports it. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to weight the recent 20 weeks of observed demand (captures latest seasonality while smoothing older noise). Sigma uses default (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to provide a conservative volatility estimate for the OR backend. These choices balance service level (using recent demand) against holding cost (no inflation of mean beyond recent evidence).

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0 confirmed) and weekly demand mostly in the 25\u201365 range with occasional spikes (max ~82). Current on-hand=29, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. Given confirmed lead time=0 and no clear sustained regime change in demand, use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set. This keeps the policy responsive to observed weekly variability while the high profit / low holding cost ratio justifies the backend's service-level-driven base stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed at Period 5 and all subsequent concludes). No sustained demand regime shift detected versus provided historical samples. Use default lead time (promised = 0) so OR backend treats same-period arrivals. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to keep forecasts anchored to historical demand and avoid overreacting to recent variability; this balances service level (profit $19) against low holding cost ($1).

Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1\u201327) consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand history is stable with no sustained regime shift. Given confirmed 0 lead time and no strong changepoint, use default estimators so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by letting the backend set the service-level-derived base stock while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Past concluded periods (P1\u2013P28) consistently show actual lead time = 0. Demand has varied weekly but shows no sustained regime shift. Using default lead time and demand estimates lets the OR backend compute base-stock consistent with historical mean/variance while preserving the confirmed 0-period lead time and avoiding overfitting to recent noise.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201329) consistently shows actual lead time = 0 and stable weekly demand varying roughly ~20\u201380 units (initial sample mean 56.8). Current on-hand=57, in-transit=0 \u2014 on-hand alone roughly covers one week of typical demand but no pipeline. Promised lead time is 0 and historical arrivals confirm same-period fulfillment, so use default lead time. Use default demand estimates so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this leverages the large historical sample and lets the backend apply the high service quantile (q\u22480.95) given profit/holding economics. No evidence of lost shipments or sustained regime change requiring manual overrides.

Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed in Period 5 and all subsequent concludes). Recent demand history shows variable weekly demand but no sustained regime shift. I choose to use promised lead time (default L=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical sample mean/variance (scaled by 1+L=1). This keeps ordering responsive (same-period arrivals) and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). To restore service with minimal complexity, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30 (Period 34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (carry-over confirmed at Period 5). Recent demand shows elevated variability with two large spikes (Periods 32-33: 94, 140) but spikes are short; use a recent-window forecast to be responsive to latest demand. No overdue shipments to reconcile. Set L to promised (default=0) consistent with observed confirmations. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (Periods 29-33) so the OR backend targets service for recent higher demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07. On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (carry-over insight Period 5). Recent weeks (Periods ~28-34) show elevated and more volatile demand (several weeks with 50-140 units, including spikes at P32-P33). To capture the recent regime shift I use recent_N on demand mean and std with N=8 (covers the most recent two months of weekly data) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher average and volatility; L uses default (promised) = 0 to match confirmed arrivals. This raises the base-stock to protect service during the recent high-demand regime while the OR engine's cap and profit/holding tradeoff limit excessive overstocking.

Demand history is long and shows no new sustained regime shift in the last several periods despite some spikes; therefore use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This balances a high profit/holding ratio (profit=$19, holding=$1 \u2192 high service target) with holding cost control via the OR engine's cap.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=12, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed Period 5), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history shows varied weekly demand but no recent sustained regime shift; use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). These conservative defaults keep the OR engine grounded in full-sample stats, avoiding overreaction to recent noise while the confirmed zero lead time lets the policy rely on same-period replenishment.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Recent history (Sept\u2013Oct) shows elevated and more volatile weekly demand versus early-year baseline (several weeks with 80\u2013140 demand). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (carry-over). To capture the recent uplift and volatility ahead of late-November retail activity, I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the last ~2 months of demand data. This biases the base-stock upward to protect service level during higher demand weeks while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability so the cap limits extreme orders and controls holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=63, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data (periods 1\u201340) consistently show actual lead time = 0; demand history exhibits no sustained regime change. Profit/holding imply a high service target (q\u22480.95). I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) plus safety stock per its formula. This leverages full-sample stats, keeps ordering responsive to observed zero lead time, and avoids overfitting short-term noise while the on-hand balance (63) provides cover for near-term demand.

Demand history shows variable weekly demand with no new sustained regime shift in the last periods (recent demands: 48, 68, 32). I choose default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with promised lead time. I select default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the full sample set\u2014this balances service level (uses full historical average) versus holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory and no evidence of a new demand spike or lost shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier). Inventory is low relative to typical weekly demand spikes seen in Oct\u2013Nov; use conservative default forecasting so OR backend uses full historical mean/variance with promised lead time. Choose default L to keep promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so base-stock and cap are computed from full-sample mean/std (lets OR engine set service level q = profit/(profit+holding)=19/20=0.95). This balances high service level (high profit) against modest holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Demand history shows stable weekly hoodie sales with recent on-hand=67 and in-transit=0. Past concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained evidence across many periods). No missing shipments observed. To let the OR backend use full historical demand moments and the promised lead time, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so base_stock and cap are computed from all samples, preserving service level while letting the model balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P44 concludes). Recent demand (Periods 40\u201344) = [68, 32, 72, 28, 46], recent mean = 49.2 units/week \u2014 lower and less stable than long-run average, so I target the (1+L)-period demand using the recent 5-week regime. Chose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) because multiple concluded periods confirm same-period arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to adapt to the current late-Nov/Dec demand regime (captures recent holiday-period dynamics) so the OR backend will size base stock to recent demand while keeping safety driven by recent volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Hoodie SKU has on-hand=67, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 in multiple periods including Period 5 confirmation), and recent demand episodes show no sustained regime shift. Profit $19 vs holding $1 implies a fairly high service-level target but holding cost is low. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) \xb1 dispersion. This keeps orders responsive to observed weekly demand while leveraging low holding cost to maintain service.
