With LT=0, orders arrive in same period and we already hold 29 units, so ordering to cover roughly one week of expected demand plus a small safety buffer is appropriate. Final decision: order 40 units (On-hand 29 + order 40 \u2192 69 units available this period), which covers ~2 weeks of expected demand including a small holiday uplift while limiting excess holding cost and downside from misforecasting OR's longer-run estimate.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 (arrivals matched orders same period). Inventory/demand: on-hand=46, in-transit=0. Recent realized weekly demand (P43\u2013P46) = {24,37,36,23}, avg \u224830/week \u2014 lower than Jan mean (~109) and consistent with the documented regime shift back to higher demand (Periods 26+), but currently at ~30. OR recommends ordering 76 using historical stats; with L=0 an order arrives in-period and will serve current demand. I want available inventory during this period \u2248 OR's implied available level (~76) without overshooting given holiday timing and holding cost. Ordering 30 units raises available inventory to 76 (46 on-hand + 30 arriving) which closely matches OR's target while limiting added holding. Final strategy: order 30 units to reach ~76 available units, matching OR's scale but slightly conservative given recent 30/week demand and inventory already covering ~1.5 weeks.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Order 30 to bring available stock to ~76 (46 on-hand + 30 arriving), aligning with OR's target but conservative because recent demand \u224830/week and lead time is 0.",
