Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Historical weekly samples (5 weeks) show typical weekly demand ~109. Use promised lead time (default) because no evidence of shift. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service vs holding cost given profit/holding ($19/$1) and lack of regime change evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/18. Recent conclude shows Period1 order (136) arrived in Period1 \u2192 observed lead time = 0. On-hand=9, in-transit=0, so pipeline is empty. Use L='calculate' to reflect observed lead time (avg observed =0). Demand history (2019 Jan\u2013Feb samples) mean=109; with L=0 the default (1+L)\xd7mean gives mu_hat aligned with historical average. Variability is consistent with historical std; use default sigma_hat to let OR backend compute safety stock. These settings keep orders responsive to low lead time while balancing holding cost (profit/holding =19).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period1; observed lead_time=0).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two immediate arrivals (Period1 and Period2) -> actual lead time = 0. On-hand=26, in-transit=0; last two weekly demands were 127 and 113, historical sample mean = 109 (5 samples: 114,94,135,102,100). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (avg=0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples (leverages full historical mean=109 and overall volatility) which balances service level against low holding cost (holding $1 vs profit $19) and current small on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1403.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-3) shows orders placed each period arrived same period (observed lead_time=0) and demand samples: 127, 113, 77. On-hand = 60, in-transit = 0, so available inventory is adequate for near-term demand but will not cover future periods without replenishment. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0), and mu_hat/sigma_hat = default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This leverages confirmed 0 lead time and the full-sample demand history to balance service level (profit $19) vs holding cost ($1).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1661.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history shows all observed lead times = 0 (orders placed in P1\u2013P4 arrived same period). On-hand=49, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history (training samples) mean ~109 units/week; recent realized weekly demand shows variability but no sustained regime change. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast given no strong changepoint. This balances service (profit/holding ratio gives q) while avoiding overreacting to short-term fluctuations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1124.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has declined (period demands: 127,113,77,90,63) with the last three periods showing a lower regime. On-hand=73, in-transit=0; on-hand roughly equals short-term forecast so avoid large replenishment. Set L to default (promised lead time 0, consistent with observed lead_time=0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime (last 3 demands = 77,90,63). This tightens forecast and reduces excess holding while preserving service given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand shows a clear recent downshift vs older samples: recent demands (Periods1-6) = [127,113,77,90,63,61], recent mean ~88.5 vs older 5-sample mean 109. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. I set L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time (will be 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the sustained recent lower regime (6-period decline), so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of last 6 samples. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=6) to capture recent volatility. This reduces measured base-stock and caps to avoid excess holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit, while preserving service against observed recent demand.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean=109 units, std\u224814.5. On-hand=76, in-transit=0 \u2014 no upcoming arrivals visible. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P7 arrived same period), so I let backend compute average lead time from observed data (calculate). I use default demand/volatility inputs so the OR engine computes mu_hat=(1+L)*mean and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples. This preserves responsiveness to the confirmed 0-period lead time and lets the backend target a high service level (profit $19 vs holding $1 favors availability) while capping orders per its policy to control holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). On-hand=120, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (confirmed in carry-over). Recent realized demand (Periods 4\u20138) shows a clear drop vs. the older sample mean. To be responsive to the recent lower demand while trusting the confirmed zero lead time, I set L to default (promised=0). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest demand regime (Periods 4\u20138 demands: 90,63,61,57,17 \u2192 mean\u224857.6) so the order target reflects current lower demand. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability rather than older samples. These choices reduce overstock risk while the backend will compute service-level buffers using profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting ~Period 4: avg demand (Periods 4\u20138) = 57.6 vs earlier sample mean 109 (\u2248-47%); sustained across 5 periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=112, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders in P1\u2013P8 arrived same period), and demand has shifted lower starting around Period 4 (Periods 4\u20138 avg=57.6 vs earlier ~109). No overdue shipments. Set L by calculating the observed lead time average (captures confirmed 0 LT). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to anchor (1+L)\xd7mean over the recent low-demand regime (Periods 4\u20138) so mu_hat reflects the sustained lower demand; use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices lower target base-stock to avoid excess holding given current low demand and holding cost, while preserving service for the new regime.

Chosen methods: L by calculate to lock in observed 0-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent low-demand regime (balances service vs holding cost given high holding horizon and ample on-hand inventory).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand has fallen sharply vs. historical samples: periods 4\u201311 show a lower regime (demands: 90,63,61,57,17,8,18,6) with avg \u2248 45 over those 8 periods vs. original sample mean ~109. On-hand = 88, in-transit = 0; no incoming arrivals recently and past orders with promised LT=0 consistently arrived same period (actual LT confirmed 0). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (confirmed by arrivals). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (reduces \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 so OR orders less, avoiding excess holding cost given high on-hand). Sigma uses recent_N N=8 to reflect lower recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward smaller replenishment quantities to balance profit vs. holding cost given the clear sustained demand drop and ample on-hand inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting ~Period 4 (Periods 4\u201312 avg demand ~57.6 vs earlier ~109). On-hand=76, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Confirmed actual lead times are 0 in concluded history. To adapt to the lower sustained demand, set lead time via observed average and base demand on the recent regime (use last 9 periods covering the new regime) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service. Chosen methods: L by calculate (reflect observed 0 lead time), mu_hat recent_N with N=9 to reflect the new lower-demand regime, sigma_hat recent_N with N=9 to capture recent variability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (multiple orders arrived same period). Demand has clearly shifted lower starting ~Period 4 and persisted through Period 13 (Periods 4\u201313 show sustained low demand; recent average ~57.6 over Periods 4\u20138 and similar thereafter). On-hand=84, in-transit=0 so no pipeline cover. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) -> 0. For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 10 samples). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=10 so volatility reflects recent regime. These choices down-weight the earlier high-demand samples and reduce replenishment to match the new lower demand, lowering holding costs while preserving service given reduced demand and verified 0 lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders in P1\u2013P14 arrived same period) so use observed lead time. Demand dropped starting ~Period 4 and has stayed low; to capture the current low-demand regime I use recent_N over the most recent 11 demand observations (Periods 4\u201314) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base-stock to current demand and avoids excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting ~Period 4 (much lower weekly demand since then). No overdue shipments. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting lower recent demand, set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=12 for demand mean and volatility to capture the post-change regime (Periods 4\u201315). This reduces target base-stock to match the sustained lower demand and lowers unnecessary replenishment.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning ~Period 4: recent weekly demand is much lower (~57.6 avg during Periods 4\u20138 vs ~109 earlier). All observed lead times have been 0 periods (orders concluding same period). On-hand=71, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to reduced demand but avoid excess holding cost. I therefore keep L at promised/default (0) consistent with observed 0 lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (covering the recent low-demand regime from ~Period 4 through Period 16) so mu_hat reflects the current lower mean over the review+lead horizon. For volatility I use recent_N N=13 to capture recent variability. These settings bias the base-stock down to match the sustained lower demand while preserving service given observed zero lead time.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Demand has exhibited a sustained downward regime since ~Period 4 (lower mean vs original sample); recent periods remain low. To reflect confirmed 0 lead time and the lower recent demand, set L by observed average lead time, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to capture the new low-demand regime and recent volatility, avoiding overstock while preserving service given high profit relative to holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. On-hand=68, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0. Demand dropped starting ~Period 4 and has remained low through Period 18 (recent weekly demands mostly single- to two-digit). To capture the sustained low-demand regime, I use recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 4\u201318, length=15) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lowered mean and volatility; L remains default (promised=0) since concluded history confirms lead time 0. This reduces target base stock to avoid excess holding while preserving service given the new lower demand pattern.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Observed sustained low-demand regime since Period 4 (carry-over note). All concluded lead-time observations = 0, so use promised/default lead time. Demand recent mean has fallen sharply; I therefore base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks to capture current low-run-rate (Periods 15\u201319 demand = 7,8,5,3,2 -> mean=5). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to current low demand and tightens safety stock accordingly, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the new regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical demands show a sustained drop beginning around Period 4 (previous carry-over noted: lower regime from Periods 4\u20138 and continuing low weekly demand through Period 20). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To avoid overstocking given low recent demand, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent data: use recent_N=10 to capture the lower regime and recent weeks' very low sales. Use the same recent_N=10 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This reduces target base-stock and limits new receipts, balancing profit per unit against holding cost with current low demand and no missing shipments.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). On-hand=68, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0. Demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 4 and this lower demand persisted through recent periods. To reflect confirmed zero lead time I set L via calculate (uses observed lead times). To capture the sustained lower-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 (uses the most recent regime-length samples to estimate mean and volatility across the review+lead period). These choices reduce target base-stock to match the persistent lower demand while keeping safety stock based on recent volatility, balancing service level versus holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime since ~Period 4 with very small recent weekly sales (Periods 18\u201322 demands = 3,2,0,1,0). On-hand = 68, in-transit = 0; with lead time historically observed = 0. I choose L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 periods) to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid inflating forecast with earlier high-season samples. Sigma also set recent_N N=5 to capture current low volatility. This keeps base-stock low to avoid holding cost while preserving service for the small current demand.

To avoid excess holding cost while matching recent demand, I keep lead time default (promised 0) and anchor demand forecast/volatility on the most recent 10 periods to capture the current low-demand regime. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=10 so the OR backend builds a much smaller base-stock reflecting recent low sales.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0; recent demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 4 and especially low in the most recent 20 weeks. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised lead time (default L=0) and estimate demand/volatility from the most recent 20 periods (recent_N N=20) so the OR engine reduces target base-stock to match the sustained lower demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Historical data shows a sustained demand drop beginning ~Period 4 that persisted through recent periods (low single-digit weekly demand since Period 9). On-hand = 65, in-transit = 0 so pipeline is empty. Actual lead time has repeatedly concluded as 0 in many periods, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent data rather than the long-run sample mean: use recent_N to capture the most recent regime (~Periods 6\u201325). Use the same recent window for volatility to let the OR backend size safety stock to current low variability. These choices reduce orders to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service for low but steady demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 so use default promised L=0. Demand has been in the lower regime since ~Period 4 (carry-over insight), so compute demand forecast from recent data: use recent_N with N=20 (capped) to capture the sustained low-demand regime while smoothing the recent spike in Period 26. Use the same recent_N=20 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock low (reducing holding cost) while preserving service given the confirmed low-demand regime and zero lead time.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0 (multiple confirms), so use promised lead time. Demand shifted down starting ~Period 4 and that low-demand regime persisted across many periods (Periods 4\u201327) with only brief spikes (P26\u201327). I treat the recent low-demand regime as dominant and use recent_N methods with N=20 (capped at 20) to capture the most recent sustained regime for both mean and volatility. This keeps target base-stock low to limit holding cost while allowing for moderate service on recent demand variability.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has jumped after long low-volume run. Lead-time history from concluded periods shows consistently 0 periods. Demand in Periods 26\u201328 = {44,107,104}, indicating a new high-demand regime beginning ~Period 26. To capture the recent spike while remaining responsive to further shifts, set L by averaging observed lead times (will remain 0). For demand estimate use recent_N on the last 3 periods (regime length=3) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)-period demand under the new regime. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices raise the target base-stock and safety stock to meet the restored demand while avoiding relying on long-ago low-demand data.

Carry-over insight: Demand spike starting Period 26: avg Periods 26\u201328 = 85 units vs avg Periods 18\u201325 = 1.125 units (\u2248+7440%), sustained across 3 periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Recent history: sustained low demand through Periods 4\u201325 then a clear spike starting Period 26 (demands P26\u2013P29 = 44,107,104,71). On-hand=73, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default L. To capture the new higher-demand regime (Periods 26\u201329 average \u224881.5) I use recent_N for demand parameters with N=4 (the most recent 4 demand observations) so the OR backend raises target stock to meet the spike while keeping variability explicit. Using recent_N for sigma similarly makes safety stock responsive to the higher volatility seen in the spike. This balances service (capture regained demand) against holding cost given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1).

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 in many concluded periods and a clear demand regime spike starting Period 26 sustained through Period 30 (demands: 44,107,104,71,87; recent mean \u224882.6). On-hand=44, in-transit=0 so we must plan for (1+L) periods of demand including current period. Set L by calculation of observed lead times (will be 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (N=5 equals the detected regime length), so the OR backend targets a base-stock tuned to current elevated demand while sigma reflects recent volatility. This balances avoiding stockouts during the recent spike vs. holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand recovered from the low mid-year regime: Periods 26\u201331 demands = [44,107,104,71,87,100], indicating a sustained higher-demand regime starting ~Period 26. On-hand=26, in-transit=0 \u2014 low pipeline vs current higher demand, so we should set demand forecast using the recent high-demand regime. Lead time history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 across concluded periods), so keep promised lead time. I choose L=default to use promised 0; mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the six most recent samples capturing the post-spike regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to raise target base-stock to meet the new higher demand while capping orders to limit holding cost exposure.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (multiple confirmations up to Period 32). Recent months show a demand uplift (Periods 26\u201332 higher than earlier low-demand regime) but that is already captured in prior carry-over insights. Given confirmed same-day arrivals and to let the OR engine use full-sample statistics for stability, I select default methods so backend computes L=(promised), mu_hat=(1+L)*mean(all samples), sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service-level (uses full historical mean/variance) against holding cost while relying on confirmed lead-time=0.

Set L to use promised (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (capture the 8-period high-demand regime) so the OR backend builds a base-stock aligned to the new demand level and balances service vs holding costs given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:

Demand regime: sustained spike beginning Period 26 (Periods 26\u201334 avg \u2248 89; much higher than earlier low-demand regime), so I use a recent-regime estimate. Set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 0 lead time. Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (regime length = Periods 26\u201334 = 9); this focuses the forecast and volatility on the recent elevated demand, helping the OR engine target service while avoiding excessive inventory given low holding cost.

=== Period 36 Summary ===
399087021: ordered=58, arrived=58 units (ordered on Period 36, lead_time was 0 periods), starting on-hand inventory=116, demand=70, sold=70, ending on-hand inventory=46

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has resumed a higher regime since the spike starting around Period 26; Periods 30\u201336 demands = [87,100,73,114,73,66,70] (avg \u2248 83.9). On-hand=46, in-transit=0, so we carry no pipeline and risk stockouts if demand continues at recent levels. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so set L based on observed average. To target service while limiting holding cost, I use a recent-window forecast that reflects the post-spike regime (use last 11 periods to cover the sustained elevated demand since Period 26). Sigma uses the same recent window to capture current volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to replenish to a base-stock appropriate for the higher recent mean while reflecting current variability and zero observed lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Observed lead times have consistently been 0 (confirmed P1 arrival P1 and every concluded order shows lead_time=0). Recent demand regime: sustained higher weekly demand since Period 26 (Periods 26\u201337 show repeated 44\u2013114 weekly sales with most weeks 60\u2013114), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current elevated regime and avoid underordering. I set L to default (promised=0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent ~10 weeks (captures periods 28\u201337 demand pattern) so the OR backend will compute a base-stock that responds to the recent elevated mean and its volatility while the cap limits over-ordering. On-hand=56 and in-transit=0 are adequate short-term but recent high demand argues for replenishment sized by recent mean/variance.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (confirmed repeatedly). Demand has moved into a higher regime since Period 26; recent weeks (Periods 30\u201338) show a steady mean \u224878.6 units/week. I set L=default to trust the promised/observed 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 (last 9 demand observations, Periods 30\u201338) to capture the current high-demand regime and its volatility so the OR backend sizes base stock to meet near-term demand while avoiding excessive holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11): on-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (many periods with arrived matching ordered). Demand has returned to higher weekly levels since Period 26 (recent weeks show regular 40\u2013100+ sales). Given confirmed 0 lead time and substantial recent demand, use default lead time so backend uses promised 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full history while respecting the confirmed 0 lead time. This balances service (capture recent higher demand via full-sample mean) against holding cost; current on-hand (61) plus zero pipeline will be compared to base_stock by OR engine to decide orders.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history: sustained higher weekly demand since the spike beginning ~Period 26 (Aug 2019) with many weeks of 40\u2013114 units; on-hand=93, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 has been consistently observed. To target high service (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 q\u22480.95) I keep L as default (promised 0). I use recent_N for demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) focusing on the recent high-demand regime (Periods ~26\u201340, regime length 15) to avoid dilution by the low-demand earlier regime. Chosen N=15 captures the sustained elevated demand and recent variance, producing a base_stock that supports high fill rate while avoiding excessive stock from older low-demand data. This also addresses the zero in-transit by sizing orders to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=75, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (many confirmed arrivals same period). Recent demand has been lower than the original historical mean but shows variability (recent 12 periods capture the post-spike regime from late summer through November). Use promised lead time to reflect confirmed 0-period arrivals; set mu_hat based on recent 12 periods to adapt to the lower recent average while covering (1+L) review+lead; keep sigma_hat as default so backend uses all-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand stock and no in-transit units.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=21, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (confirmed). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (Periods 38\u201342 demands = 62,48,32,39,119); I treat the most recent regime as relevant for next-period demand. Set L to default (promised lead time=0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the last 5 observed demands, which reduces stockouts given recent uplift while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1.0.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=94, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (many periods); no overdue/lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 39\u201343 = 48,32,39,119,24) is more relevant than long-run mean due to volatility and a late-Nov spike (P42=119). To balance service versus holding cost I use a recent-window forecast so the OR engine targets stock for the current regime: L uses promised (default), mu_hat and sigma_hat use the last 5 periods to capture recent mean and variability while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes.
