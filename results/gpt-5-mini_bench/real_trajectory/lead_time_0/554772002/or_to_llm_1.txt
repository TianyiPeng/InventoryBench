  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history and carry-over confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders arrive same period). Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=22, in-transit=0. Recent realized weekly demand over Periods 43\u201346 = [8,10,14,14], 4-period avg = 11.5 units/week, well below long-run historical avg \u224868.6 used by OR. OR's recommendation (77) is driven by historical mean and the cap formula; it ignores the sustained drop in demand seen over the last 4 periods and the confirmed 0 lead time. With L=0, any order placed now would arrive this period and immediately incur holding cost if unneeded. Given profit=$4 and holding=$1, the OR\u2019s high critical fractile would push large safety stock, but current demand regime is clearly lower and sustained for >3 periods. Action: do not follow OR \u2014 avoid overstock and holding cost by placing 0 units. This preserves margin (avoid paying holding cost on ~50+ excess units) while on-hand (22) comfortably covers expected single-period demand (~12).",
