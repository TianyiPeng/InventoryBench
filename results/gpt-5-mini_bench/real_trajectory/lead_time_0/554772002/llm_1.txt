Recent average = (58+59+81+84+61)/5 = 68.6 \u2248 69 units/week. Late-January showed a short higher regime (~82 avg for two weeks) but not sustained 3+ periods, so treat baseline ~69. c) Lead time / missing-orders: Supplier promised LT=0 but actual LT is unknown. No concluded arrivals/history to confirm on-time delivery; therefore assume LT may be \u22651 (conservative). d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Because arrivals occur after the decision phase, any order placed now may not be available for current-period demand if actual LT\u22651. To avoid stockouts and lost sales, plan to cover current and next period demand. e) Order logic: target coverage = 2 \xd7 expected weekly demand \u2248 2\xd769 \u2248 138. Round to a practical whole unit. Balance: satisfies likely two-period demand while limiting holding cost ($1/unit/period).",
