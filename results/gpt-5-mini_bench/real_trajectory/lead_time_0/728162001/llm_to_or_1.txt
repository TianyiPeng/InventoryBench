Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 36 units/week; no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. Promised lead time used (default) since no observed lead-time data. mu_hat set to default to use (1+L)*mean of all samples (captures baseline demand). sigma_hat set to default to reflect historical variability across samples. This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) using historical demand until we observe sustained shifts or delayed arrivals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~36 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 order of 53 arrived same period (lead_time observed=0). No evidence of lost shipments. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period arrival. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service (cover current + lead periods) against holding cost given a modest holding cost/profit ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly mean (Jan samples) ~36 units, but recent observed demand is elevated (Period1 demand=53, Period2 demand=93 with stockouts). Promised lead time has historically been 0 (orders in P1 and P2 concluded with lead_time=0). I keep L at default (promised 0). To respond to the clear upward demand signal while still blending historical data, I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.7) to give strong weight to recent high demands; this raises the (1+L) demand forecast without overreacting to a single week. I leave sigma_hat as default so the backend uses the full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This setup increases target base stock to improve service in face of higher observed demand while relying on default lead time and volatility estimates.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1565.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent selling has risen sharply vs Jan samples: Period1-3 demands = 53, 93, 83 (mean ~76) vs historical Jan mean ~36. On-hand=12, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 for prior orders. I detect a sustained demand regime shift upward (3 periods). Therefore keep L at default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 3 high-demand periods, and set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility; this raises replenishment targets to cover the new demand while avoiding excess stock based on the recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: historical Jan mean \u224836 (samples 51,30,35,39,25) -> recent Period1-3 mean \u224876 (53,93,83), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $2109.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead_times for Periods 1-4 are all 0 \u2192 use calculate to set L=0. Demand has shifted up recently (Period1-4 demands = 53,93,83,121; recent mean=87.5) so I use recent_N=4 for mu_hat to capture the new higher regime. Use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices push the OR base-stock toward meeting higher short-term demand while keeping holding exposure moderated by using only the recent regime rather than the full historical low-demand sample.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has shifted materially higher: last 3 demand samples = 53,93,83 (avg ~76) and this regime sustained for 3+ periods per carry-over. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish to cover elevated short-term demand. Set L by calculating observed lead times (all concluded arrivals show 0). For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (mu_hat and sigma_hat over the most recent 3 samples). These choices bias orders toward higher safety stock to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 4 (demands: P4=121, P5=270, P6=266); on-hand=55, in-transit=0, so pipeline is zero. Observed lead times have been 0 in concluded periods. I set L by calculating the average observed lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 4-6). Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise the base stock to cover the elevated recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent demand has shifted up and been sustained since Period 4 (demands: P4-7 = 121,270,266,233). On-hand=126, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty. Observed concluded lead times in history are all 0, so average lead time = 0. To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime (last 4 periods, P4-7). These parameters will raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while L=calculate confirms the confirmed 0 lead time to avoid overestimating pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-08. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile after the earlier regime shift: last 3 concluded weekly demands = [266,233,136]. On-hand=202, in-transit=0 so current inventory covers roughly 0.9\u20131.5 weeks of recent demand. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 historically. To reflect the most recent demand regime and the lack of pipeline, I set L by averaging observed lead times (will be 0), and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the current higher, somewhat volatile demand while avoiding overstock from older low-demand weeks.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so set L by calculating observed lead time average. Demand has shifted upward versus the Jan baseline (carry-over insight notes prior regime shift). Recent demand (Periods 6-10) is higher and more relevant for forecasting; I use a recent_N=5 window to capture current mean/volatility ((demands: 266,233,136,167,195) ) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current regime and keep safety stock aligned to higher demand while avoiding excessive holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has been elevated and variable since Period 5 (demands P5-P11: 270,266,233,136,167,195,147), indicating a sustained higher-demand regime vs. historical Jan samples. All observed lead times = 0 (no delayed/lost shipments), so use promised lead time. I set L=default to keep lead time = promised (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5-11) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent 7 samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit $19 and holding $1. No overdue shipments to adjust for.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/5/6: on-hand=214, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 historically. Demand has a confirmed higher regime since Period 4; recent observed demands (Periods 8-12 = 136,167,195,147,79) average ~145. No overdue shipments to reconcile. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) given consistent concluded arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent demand regime (last 5 periods) so the OR backend targets service for current demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/13 (Period 14). On-hand=174, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 keep promised lead time. Recent demand shows a higher regime than the Jan baseline; using the last 5 weeks (Periods 9-13 demands = 167,195,147,79,42) captures current demand level while smoothing week-to-week noise. Set L to default (promised=0) so OR uses 1-period review only; set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect the elevated recent mean and volatility and to balance service (profit $19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=181, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has moderated (periods 12-14 demands = 79,42,50) but a prior regime shift was already recorded at Period 4. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and long-run sample stats, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to short recent variability while the observed shipments remain reliable.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent demand has settled higher than the historical Jan baseline: last 5 demand samples (P11-P15) = [147,79,42,50,60], mean \u224875.6. All concluded lead-times remain 0 (orders historically arrived same period). On-hand=185, in-transit=0 so inventory is ample; however to align the OR backend with the recent higher-demand regime I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture current mean and volatility while keeping lead time at the promised/default (observed = 0). This balances service (uses recent higher mean) against holding cost given current high on-hand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=129, in-transit=0. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) = [79,42,50,60,56], showing a moderate recent regime (~57 units/week) lower than the earlier peak but higher than historical Jan baseline. No evidence of lead-time drift (all concluded lead_times=0). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to reflect the most recent regime; keep L=default (promised 0).

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so keep L=default (promised=0). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime (recent demands P15-17 = 60,56,116; mean\u224877), matching prior carry-over note. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the new regime over the last 3 periods; use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This raises base_stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent mean while keeping holding cost in mind.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show substantially higher demand than historical Jan samples; last 5 demand observations (Periods 14-18) = [50,60,56,116,151], indicating a recent higher-demand regime. Promised lead time has consistently been observed as 0 historically, so use default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current elevated mean and variance so the OR engine raises base-stock to meet higher short-term demand while limiting excess inventory from older low-demand data.

Recent demand shows three elevated weeks (Periods 17-19: 116, 151, 140) suggesting a short-lived high-demand regime; no evidence of lead-time deviations (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Set L to default (promised). Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat to target the current short-run demand level (1+L times mean of last 3 samples) and recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This balances service (responding to the recent spike) vs holding cost given low pipeline inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=24, in-transit=0; recent demand is high (Periods 22-24 demands = 227,221,246). No overdue shipments. I choose L=default (promised lead time, historically 0). For mu_hat use recent_N N=3 to capture the sustained elevated demand ((1+L)*mean of last 3 \u2248231 units). For sigma_hat use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These parameters raise the base-stock to meet the new high-demand regime while keeping safety stock tied to recent volatility to limit holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=161, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Recent demand (Periods 18-25) elevated: demands = [151,140,98,173,227,221,246,92], mean \u2248168.5 over last 8 periods \u2014 sustained higher regime vs. historical winter samples. Lead times observed historically=0; use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 so the OR engine targets service for the current elevated demand while keeping L=default to reflect observed 0-day arrivals.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. On-hand=109, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 22-26) show elevated and variable demand (227,221,246,92,157) vs older history; last 5 periods capture the current regime. All concluded lead times have been 0 historically. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N N=5 to anchor mu_hat to the latest regime (reduces mismatch from older low-season samples). I also use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to current demand while limiting holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=121, in-transit=0; recent demand shows volatility with a short-term mean \u2248110 (Periods 26-28: 157,84,89). All concluded lead-times = 0 historically, so keep promised lead time. To keep service while inventory is lean and arrivals are immediate, set L=default. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the latest short-term demand regime. Use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility and avoid understocking. This balances higher profit per unit vs low holding cost by targeting recent demand rather than long-term averages and keeps orders aligned with observed zero lead time and no in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods consistently, so keep L as promised (default). Demand has been in a higher, sustained regime since Period 4 (summer weeks); to reflect the recent elevated demand and variance, use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures most recent ~20 weeks since the regime shift, capped at 20). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to balance service-level (profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding excessive holding given current on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

Recent weekly demand has been in a higher regime vs. early-year (sustained). Use promised lead time (default L=0). Forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current high-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to recent changes. Use recent 5-week volatility for sigma to reflect current demand variability. This balances service (higher recent mean) against holding cost given modest on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Recent demand has cooled vs earlier 2019 spike; last 5 demand samples (Periods 31-35 = 166,160,140,46,49) show a lower recent mean (~112) and elevated variability from the drop. To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory, use recent_N=5 for demand mean and std so OR backend targets a replenishment level closer to current demand regime while preserving service.

Recent weekly demand has moderated vs summer peaks; to respond to current lower recent demand while remaining responsive to variability, I use a calculated lead time (avg observed = 0) and short-window recent demand estimates (last 5 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory to recent demand patterns and limits excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=100, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. Recent weekly demand has been variable but lower than mid-year peaks; to keep service up while limiting holding cost I rely on recent demand behavior. Use promised lead time (0) since all concluded orders show lead_time=0. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the most recent regime while smoothing short blips; apply same recent window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances service level (protects against recent demand) versus holding cost by avoiding full-historical mean which includes earlier high peaks.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. On-hand=182, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since early periods (sustained higher weekly sales vs. initial Jan samples). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, I use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the current regime. I select recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent behavior while capping at 20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap from up-to-date mean/volatility. This balances service (profit-oriented q) with carrying cost given ample on-hand and no pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been elevated (~83,101,51,79 in Periods 37-40; recent mean \u224878) and prior carry-over flagged a sustained regime shift earlier. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use a recent-window demand forecast to capture the higher recent mean/volatility. L: use default promised lead time (0). mu_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to target the current higher demand regime. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=5 so safety stock reflects recent volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders consistently arrived same period), no overdue or lost shipments observed. A prior demand regime shift (early-year) was previously recorded; recent weeks show moderate demand (last conclude demand=64) but not a new sustained change. Use promised lead time to keep pipeline short (L=0). Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean & std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend finds a high service level consistent with profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$19, holding=$1 -> target quantile q\u22480.95). This keeps orders aggressive enough to avoid stockouts while limiting excess holding given current on-hand=85.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=94, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows an uptick (last 3 concluded demands: Periods 40-42 = 79, 64, 134; recent mean \u224892) and we are in early December where demand can be elevated. Promised lead time historically observed as 0; use default L to let backend treat lead time as promised. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime/holiday uplift and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the current demand spike while limiting unnecessary long-term holding cost given on-hand inventory and zero in-transit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=128, in-transit=0. Historical Jan baseline was ~36 but prior changepoint (noted earlier) showed a sustained higher regime; recent concluded demands (Periods 41-43 = 64,134,25) yield a 3-period mean \u224874.3. No arrivals expected this period (promised LT=0 used). To capture the recent regime while keeping responsiveness, set L=default (use promised lead time) and mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Use sigma_hat=default to let backend scale volatility from full-sample std, balancing service vs. holding cost given substantial on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=171, in-transit=0. Observed lead times historically are 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has been mixed but no new sustained regime change since the previously recorded shift. Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses its known lead time. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma so backend applies full-sample statistics; this avoids overreacting to short recent dips and relies on established historical evidence while on-hand stock is already high.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Recent concluded weeks (Periods 43-45) show low demand (25,14,21) and on-hand is high (204) with no in-transit. Historical data contains earlier higher regimes, but there is no sustained new evidence of lead-time change or a multi-week jump in demand now. Promised lead time = 0 has been consistently observed in concludes. To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and low recent sales while keeping high service level (q\u22480.95 from profit/holding), use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes base stock from the full-sample mean/variance and respects the capped order size.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent realized demand has been very low in December (Periods 44-46: 14,21,24) while on-hand is high (200) and in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting near-term demand, keep promised lead time (0) and forecast using the most recent low-demand regime. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=3 to reflect the last three weeks' demand (captures current low-december regime) so the OR backend reduces ordering intensity and balances high profit-driven service level against holding cost.
