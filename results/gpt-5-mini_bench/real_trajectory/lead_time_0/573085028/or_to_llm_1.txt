{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (arrivals observed same period repeatedly). Inventory state: on-hand=145, in-transit=0. Recent demand (concluded): P43 demand=235, P44=370, P45=293, P46=162 \u2014 very elevated in Dec with a peak then partial decline but still above pre-Period21 baseline. OR recommended 105 using historical averages and promised L; OR cap is conservative but doesn't account for recent sustained high demand in Aug+ and strong December volumes. Because L=0, any order placed now will arrive before demand resolution and immediately increase available stock. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) (critical fractile \u22480.95), it's preferable to keep a buffer to avoid lost sales during holiday tail demand. I raise OR's 105 to 120 units to cover elevated near-term demand while limiting excess holding; with on-hand 145 + order 120 = 265 available, close to the recent 3\u20134 week average (~265) and provides safety stock for variability.
