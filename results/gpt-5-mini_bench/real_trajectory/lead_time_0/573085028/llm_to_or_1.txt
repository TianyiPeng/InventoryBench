Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable weekly demand (mean \u224861.6). No sustained changepoint or evidence of lead-time deviation (no concluded arrivals), so use promised lead time and population estimates. Choosing default for L, mu_hat, sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order of 77 arrived with lead_time=0. Recent realized demand in Period 1 was 93 (higher than prior sample mean ~61.6). With only one high-demand observation since the historical samples, I will keep lead time at the promised/default and use default demand estimators so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/variance (avoids overfitting to a single spike). This balances service (cover demand variability) against holding cost given limited evidence of a sustained shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demands in conclude messages: Period1=93, Period2=81; earlier historical weekly mean ~61.6 (Jan). Lead times observed so far are 0 periods (both concluded orders had lead_time=0). I keep L as calculated average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. Demand shows an upward shift but only 2 periods of high demand\u2014insufficient for a sustained regime record\u2014so I use an EWMA (gamma=0.5) to give more weight to recent higher demand while retaining historical signal. sigma_hat left as default to reflect overall historical variability. These parameters bias orders upward to reduce stockouts from recent higher demand while controlling inventory via the OR engine's capped policy and modest holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1076.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Recent concluded periods show lead_time=0 for orders placed in Periods 1-3. Recent demand (Periods 1-3): 93, 81, 59 (avg 77.67), which is higher than the older sample mean (61.6). To capture the apparent recent regime, I set L by calculating observed lead times, and use a recent_N=3 forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in check.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1,P2,P3 orders arrived same period); Demand regime shift: recent avg 77.67 vs historical 61.6 (+26%).

Daily Reward (R_t): $713.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent on-hand=66, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible this period. Historical weekly mean=61.6 but recent demand shows a higher regime (last 3 demands: 93,81,59 \u2192 mean 77.67). Lead time has been observed as 0 in concluded periods. To prioritize service (profit $19 vs holding $1) I set L based on observed lead times, and set demand forecast using the most recent short-run regime (N=3) to capture the confirmed uptick; sigma also uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This increases base-stock to reduce stockouts while holding cost is low relative to profit.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history shows same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed) and variable weekly demand; to keep policy aligned with promised lead time and historical training samples, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/std. This avoids overreacting to short recent volatility while leveraging confirmed L=0.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 periods. Recent demand shows a modestly higher mean vs earlier historical sample but with variability across weeks; to capture the most recent behavior while smoothing week-to-week noise I use recent_N over the last 6 observed demand samples (Periods 1\u20136). sigma_hat uses default to reflect overall sample volatility. These choices (L=default, mu_hat from recent 6 weeks, sigma_hat=default) let the OR backend size base stock to the recent demand level while keeping dispersion driven by full-sample variability, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical baseline mean=61.6 (2019 Jan samples). Recent periods show a sustained higher-demand regime early in history (Periods 1-3 demands: 93,81,59 -> avg 77.67, +26% vs baseline). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default L=0. To capture the recent elevated demand while keeping sample window conservative, I use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 1-3). This raises the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead period demand and increases safety stock to preserve service level given higher observed mean; holding cost is low relative to profit so this is justified.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P8 arrived same period). Recent demand has varied; earlier flagged regime shift was not sustained by later periods. No overdue shipments. To be robust, I use observed lead-time average (calculate) and default demand estimates based on the full sample set so the OR backend uses the full-history mean/variance rather than overfitting to short windows. This balances service (captures overall demand) against holding cost given low holding=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 5-9 = 67,48,52,65,42) shows no sustained high spike vs early periods, so I avoid using long-run historical mean that includes an earlier short spike. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 periods) to capture the most recent regime while meeting the OR engine's (1+L) scaling and keeping safety stock moderate given profit/holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (Periods 1-10) consistently show actual lead time = 0; carry-over already recorded a demand regime shift. I set L=default to use promised (and confirmed) lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (most weight on latest weeks) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demand samples. Sigma set to default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost by increasing the base-stock via recent demand without over-inflating sigma.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders have consistently arrived same period). Recent demand appears elevated vs the long-run historical Jan samples and shows variability across the last 11 periods (sustained changes), so I use a recent_N demand forecast over the full recent window to capture the current regime. I keep lead time as default (promised = 0) and sigma as default to let the backend compute volatility from all samples. This balances service (capture recent higher mean) against holding cost by using recent demand for mu_hat while relying on backend's sigma estimate.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 (consistent across many periods) and demand has shifted higher since Period 4. I set L to be inferred from observed lead times (calculate) to confirm zero. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (regime starting at Period 4 -> 9 periods of post-change data) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and volatility; this raises the base-stock to protect service while keeping holding cost in mind. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical samples show baseline mean=61.6 but recent periods have been higher and more variable; lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To prioritize service (profit $19 vs hold $1 => high target fill), keep L at promised (default, confirmed=0) and use an EWMA to bias the forecast toward recent demand while smoothing noise (gamma=0.3). Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale variability with (1+L). This balances higher recent demand signals against holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 0 (concluded arrivals every period) and a sustained demand uplift since Period 4 (carry-over noted: recent avg \u224877.7 vs historical 61.6, +26%). Current on-hand=45, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To capture the confirmed higher-demand regime, I use recent_N demand estimates over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 4\u201314, 11 samples) while keeping L at the promised/default (0). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR engine bases base-stock and caps on the elevated recent mean and volatility, improving service while controlling holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Historical concluded periods (P1\u2013P15) show a sustained demand increase vs early-history (carry-over: recent avg ~77.7 vs historical ~61.6). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concludes, so I keep promised/default lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set demand forecast using recent sample averaging: recent_N with N=8 (uses the most recent 8 demand observations to compute (1+L)*mean). I also set sigma to recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock and limit holding cost impact.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 and no recent lost shipments. Demand history shows earlier documented regime shift; however recent weeks (Periods 12-16) do not provide strong new sustained change. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand statistics so the OR backend applies the established base-stock calculation while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

Historical concluded data show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed) and a sustained demand uplift since Period 4 (recent avg ~77.67 vs historical ~61.6). To reflect the higher recent demand while using confirmed lead time=0, I set L to default (promised 0). I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime from Period 4 onward (14 samples) so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 14 observations, improving service with moderate inventory given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and a sustained demand uptick vs older baseline (carry-over insight from Period 4). I therefore keep L at promised/default (0). To capture the recent higher demand regime, I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (weights the last 5 demand observations for (1+L)\xd7mean). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase the target base-stock to improve service (higher profit per unit) while using a short lookback to limit excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit/period.

LLM Rationale:

Demand regime increased (carry-over evidence: recent avg 77.67 vs historical 61.6, +26%). To reflect the sustained higher demand I use recent_N estimates for demand (capture the post-changepoint regime) while keeping L at the promised/default (0). recent_N with N=16 captures the regime from Period 4 onward and informs both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend increases target stock to meet higher demand while the profit/holding tradeoff remains encoded in the backend service-level calculation.

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0. Use promised/default lead time to match observed behavior. Demand estimate: use recent_N (N=5) to focus the estimator on the most recent sample window (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples). Keep sigma as default to let backend use full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (use recent demand average) vs holding cost given limited on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data (P1\u2013P21) confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime increase since Period 4 (recent average \u224877.7 vs historical \u224861.6, ~+26%). I keep L at the promised/default (0) because multiple concluded arrivals show same-period fulfillment. To capture the higher recent demand, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 (regime from Period 4\u2192Period 21 is ~18 samples) so the forecast and volatility reflect the new regime while smoothing older data. This increases service (reducing stockouts) while holding cost is low ($1/unit) relative to profit ($19/unit).

I keep L=default (promised 0, confirmed by prior arrivals). To reflect the recent higher-demand regime while limiting noise, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures last 5 weeks demand behavior).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-07-22. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows actual lead time=0 (multiple P1-P23 arrivals same period). Recent demand has jumped: Periods 21-23 demands = [79,110,141] (3-period avg=110), which is a sustained 3-period increase vs the prior recent avg ~77.67. To restore service with minimal hold cost, keep L=default (promised 0, confirmed by concludes) and use recent_N for demand estimates focused on the new regime: mu_hat uses recent_N N=3 to capture the elevated mean across the review+lead period; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet higher immediate demand while keeping safety stock responsive to current variance, balancing profit-driven service level against the low holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21-23: avg increased from 77.67 to 110 (+41.6%)

Demand has shifted upward recently: Periods 21\u201323 show a higher regime (~110 avg) vs earlier (~77.67). I use promised/default lead time (0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (last 3 periods reflecting the new regime). This raises the forecasted review+lead demand and the estimated volatility so the OR backend increases base stock and orders to avoid stockouts while accounting for holding cost via the backend cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=77, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2192 use promised/default L. Recent demand has stepped up (Periods 21-25 = 79,110,141,77,85; recent avg \u224898.4 vs earlier long-run \u224861.6). I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher mean and volatility so the OR backend sets a base-stock that reflects the recent regime and balances $19 profit vs $1 holding cost. Using default L ensures (1+L) scaling is correct for same-period arrivals.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time has been 0 (orders arrive same period). Recent demand shows a sustained elevated regime since Period 21 (weeks 21\u201326) with higher average and volatility versus earlier history; I therefore use recent sample estimates to capture the new demand level. I keep L as default (promised 0) because concluded messages confirm 0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the most recent 6 weeks of demand (captures the regime shift while limiting responsiveness to a single extreme spike). These parameters give the OR engine a higher base stock to reduce stockouts while using recent volatility to avoid excessive overstock given holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has shifted up since Periods 21-23 (recent regime avg ~110) with very large spikes in Periods 26-27 (177, 311). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=0 with arrivals historically same-period. I set L=default to use the promised (confirmed) 0-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the new higher-demand regime (periods 21\u201327, regime length=7) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of the most recent 7 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=7 to capture increased volatility. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while reflecting recent variance to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=16, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-day arrivals (lead_time=0 across many periods) and two demand regime shifts: first around P4 (avg ~77.7 vs historical 61.6) and a stronger upward shift beginning P21\u2013P27 (recent demands much higher: P24\u2013P28 = [77,85,177,311,262]). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0) since concluded messages repeatedly confirm 0 lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand observations) so the OR backend targets a base-stock reflecting the new, elevated mean and volatility and avoids stockouts while limiting excess holding cost given holding=$1/unit.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=141, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Demand regime increased starting ~Period 21 (sustained higher weekly demand through Period 29). To capture the new high-demand regime I use L=default (promised/confirmed 0), mu_hat=recent_N using the most recent regime samples (Periods 21\u201329, N=9) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of last 9 samples, and sigma_hat=recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps supply targeting the elevated demand while avoiding excess inventory given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent weeks (Periods 21-30) show a clear demand regime shift with much higher weekly demand (peaks 177\u2013311) vs earlier history. On-hand=79, in-transit=0, so pipeline is zero and current stock covers only ~0.3\u20130.5 of recent weekly demand \u2014 risk of stockout if demand remains elevated. Observed lead time historically confirmed as 0 periods; keep L=default (promised). To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (regime from P21\u2013P30, length=10) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and volatility from last 10 samples, improving service vs holding-cost balance under the shifted demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2436.00

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has clearly shifted higher since late July; last 5 concluded demands (P27-P31) = [311,262,213,223,137], recent mean = 229.2. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods in concluded history (Periods 1-31). On-hand=167, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover the higher recent demand. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new high-demand regime and avoid diluting with older lower-demand weeks. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility. These parameters push the OR engine toward a higher base-stock to balance the $19 profit against $1 holding cost given the recent surge.

To capture the recent higher demand regime and protect service while holding costs are low relative to profit, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the review+lead forecast and volatility on the most recent regime: N=9 (covers the recent elevated-demand window), which balances responsiveness and sample size.

Demand shifted up starting around Periods 21-23 and the elevated regime has persisted through Period 33 (regime length = 13 periods). To capture the sustained higher demand I use recent_N over the last 13 periods for both demand mean and volatility; keep L at default (promised 0) since conclude messages confirm 0 lead time. This raises the backend base-stock to reflect the new higher-demand regime while honoring low holding cost vs profit tradeoff.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are 0 (consistent), so keep promised lead time. Recent demand shows a sustained, higher regime beginning around Period 26 (Aug) \u2014 I capture recent behavior to size the (1+L) forecast and volatility. Set L=default to use promised 0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (Periods 26\u201336) to reflect the elevated, volatile demand observed since the Aug uptick; this helps the OR backend raise base stock and account for higher variability while relying on the backend cap to limit extreme orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26-31: avg increased to 220.5 (Periods 26\u201331 avg) from prior 110.0 (Periods 21\u201323 avg), +100.5 units (+91.4%).

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows sustained high demand since Period 26 (Periods 26\u201331 avg \u2248220.5) and lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded periods. On-hand=171, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms 0. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (Periods 26\u201331) so the forecast and volatility reflect the most recent regime rather than the long-run mean. This raises the base stock to protect service during the elevated demand while sigma_hat recentization prevents underestimating variability, balancing profit-driven service level against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=169, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (consistent through Period 38). Recent weeks show demand volatile after the large spike, but no new 3+ period sustained regime change to justify changing estimators. To balance service vs holding cost I use default/global estimates so the OR backend smooths recent spikes using all samples and the confirmed lead time=0.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has moderated from the peak regime (Periods 26\u201331 avg=220.5) \u2014 last 8 observed demands (Periods 32\u201339) average ~150.9. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. No overdue/lost shipments visible (in-transit=0, arrivals always same-period historically). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) to capture the more recent post-peak demand regime while still smoothing short noise. I keep sigma_hat as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). These choices prioritize matching the OR backend forecast to the recent lower-but-still-elevated demand while avoiding overstock from the earlier transient peak; using recent demand reduces stockouts without excessive holding given low holding cost and confirmed zero lead time.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=209, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 0 periods (consistent arrivals each period). Recent demand has fallen from the high summer/autumn spikes (Periods 26\u201337) back toward lower weekly sales (Periods 37\u201340: 153,128,119,60). To keep the OR engine responsive to this recent lower demand while preserving service, I use the recent_N estimator (N=6) for both demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent regime and avoid overstocking given holding cost=1 vs profit=19. L uses the promised/default (0) consistent with observed concludes.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=262, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0; recent demand has softened from the peak (Periods 26\u201331) so I rely on the most recent samples to forecast. Set L=default to keep promised 0. Use recent_N with N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest demand regime (last 6 weeks) and reduce overweighting earlier peak weeks. This balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has fallen from summer/fall peaks; on-hand=226, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history. I choose L='calculate' to reflect observed lead times (all 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest downshift in demand (last 5 weeks: 128,119,60,36,47 -> recent mean ~78) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep replenishment responsive to the current lower demand while acknowledging confirmed 0 lead time and avoiding excess holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand is volatile but clearly in a higher regime since Period 26 (carry-over). Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed). To prioritize service (profit $19 >> holding $1) I keep L=default (promised=0) and forecast using recent data to reflect the current high-demand regime. I choose recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent week-plus of demand (balances responsiveness vs noise). This raises the backend base-stock and cap to reduce stockouts while the low holding cost keeps carry cost modest.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (many arrived same period). Recent demand has shifted up in prior regimes (noted through Period 37) and recent weeks show very high demand (Periods 39\u201344 volatile, including 370 in P44). To capture the current high-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times (will be 0) and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 concluded demand samples, balancing service level for elevated demand while limiting holding cost given high variance.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=70, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (sustained). Recent history (Periods ~37\u201345) shows a substantially elevated and volatile demand regime vs earlier periods; to capture current elevated mean and volatility I use recent_N=8 (covers the most recent 8 concluded weeks) for both demand mean and std. Keeping L=default (promised 0) lets backend rely on observed same-period arrivals. These settings raise the base-stock to service the higher recent demand while sigma recent_N captures elevated variability so the capped order prevents excessive overstock given holding cost.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 and multiple demand regime shifts upward (notably Periods 26\u201331 and later spikes in Dec).
