Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples: [15,50,198,60,68] (mean \u2248 78). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence. Promised lead time used (no observed lead-time changepoint). Use default demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded history: Period 1 order arrived with lead_time=0 (one confirmed sample). On-hand=141, in-transit=0, last period demand=53. Historical sample mean ~78.2 from provided Jan samples. No evidence of lost shipments or sustained regime shift. Use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two same-period arrivals (Period1 and Period2 orders had lead_time=0). On-hand=99, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L by calculating average observed lead time to confirm 0. Demand samples (historical weeks) are limited but show mean ~78; use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps target stock driven by overall historical mean while leveraging confirmed 0 lead time to avoid extra pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1589.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 for P1,P2,P3 (consistent same-period arrivals). Demand history includes early-Jan samples and recent period demands (53,80,88). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time=0. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced forecast that leverages full history while the confirmed zero lead time keeps review+lead horizon minimal and reduces holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1334.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-4) = [53,80,88,75], on-hand=91, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods, so use observed lead time. No sustained demand regime shift detected; use last 4 weeks to capture latest sales velocity (N determined by available recent periods = 4). High profit vs holding (profit=19, holding=1) implies a high target service level; using recent demand and recent volatility will let the OR backend size base-stock to meet service goals while avoiding excess holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1241.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent observed lead times all 0; recent demand has stabilized around mid-60s\u201380s (recent periods: 53,80,88,75,67). On-hand=32, in-transit=0 so current inventory is well below recent demand. I set L to calculate (uses observed lead times). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the most recent regime (exclude the large Jan outlier) so the OR engine targets a base-stock that covers ~1 period of recent demand while keeping holding costs low.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history shows orders consistently arriving same period (lead time=0 confirmed in Period 4). Demand historically volatile but no sustained regime change since provided samples. With lead time=0 we only need (1+L)=1 period of demand in review; using default demand estimates (all samples) balances service level vs holding cost given high per-unit profit ($19) vs low holding ($1). Parameters chosen: L default to trust confirmed 0-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat default to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap from full sample history.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized weekly demand has fallen vs earlier historical samples: last 5 periods demand = [88,75,67,51,32], mean\u224862.6 units/week. On-hand=117, in-transit=0 \u2192 ~1.9 weeks coverage at recent demand. Lead-time has been consistently 0 in concluded history; use promised/default. To avoid overstock given low holding cost but declining demand, I forecast using the recent 5-week regime for demand (mu_hat recent_N N=5) and match volatility to the same window (sigma_hat recent_N N=5). This balances service (cover ~1\u20132 weeks) while limiting holding cost exposure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $283.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has fallen: last 3 weekly demands = {51, 32, 20} (clear downtrend vs earlier weeks). On-hand=97, in-transit=0, so current stock covers multiple weeks at recent rates. Lead time historically confirmed 0 (carry-over). Use L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N with N=3 to respond quickly to the recent downward regime (N=3 chosen because the most recent 3 periods show a sustained drop). These settings reduce future overstock while preserving service for near-term demand; sigma estimated from same recent window to reflect lower variability.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-04-15. On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has trended down (last 5 concluded demands: 67,51,32,20,17). All observed lead times = 0 (confirmed in history). To match the recent lower demand regime while keeping service, use promised lead time (default L=0) and base forecasts on the most recent 5 periods: mu_hat recent_N=5 captures the downward shift; sigma_hat recent_N=5 captures current volatility. No evidence of lost shipments.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand shows a clear downward shift: last 3 weeks = [20,17,13] (mean \u224816.7) versus earlier samples much higher. On-hand=67, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals (lead time historically confirmed as 0). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set lead time to promised/default (0) and base forecast on the most recent regime using recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets the lower current demand and tighter variability.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has declined sharply from earlier periods; on-hand=50, in-transit=0 so current coverage \u2248 2\u20133 weeks at current rates. No concluded arrivals outstanding and prior carry-over confirmed lead time = 0. I set L to default to use the promised lead time (0) consistent with confirmed evidence. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime (Periods 7\u201311) rather than the older higher-demand data; this reduces orders and limits holding cost while preserving service. The chosen parameters let the OR backend compute a base-stock tuned to the recent mean and volatility, balancing profit vs holding cost given the sustained demand drop.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg decreased from 69.0 (Periods 1\u20136) to 19.8 (Periods 7\u201311), a \u221271% change, sustained for 5 periods.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 7 (demands P8\u2013P12 = 20,17,13,17,25). On-hand=25, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Lead time previously confirmed as 0; keep promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current low-demand regime (captures mean \u224818.4 and recent volatility), which reduces overstock risk while meeting service given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime beginning Period 7 (Periods 7\u201313 consistently lower than Periods 1\u20136). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded history. To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand mean/volatility using the most recent regime length (~7 periods) so forecasts focus on current lower demand and avoid overstocking given holding cost $1 vs profit $19. Using promised/default lead time (0) matches observed arrivals.

No overdue/lost shipments visible. To reflect the persistent lower demand I use recent_N=8 (Periods 7\u201314) for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and caps orders accordingly while keeping L as promised (0).

Demand dropped starting Period 7 and has remained low; recent demand (Periods 11\u201315) = [17,25,14,7,6], mean=13.8, std\u22486.97. I set L=default (promised 0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the sustained low-demand regime and avoid overstocking; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize lowering target base stock to reduce holding cost while maintaining service for current low-demand regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (consistent arrivals P1\u2013P16). Demand regime dropped at Period 7 and has remained low (Periods 7\u201316). I set L to default (promised 0) since concluded arrivals confirm 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 (Periods 7\u201316) to capture the sustained low-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean \u2014 this avoids overweighting the earlier high-demand samples. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10 to reflect current lower volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with the current low-demand regime, reducing holding cost while maintaining service given the high profit per unit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 7 (Periods 7\u201317 show consistently lower demand). I will use promised lead time (default=0). For demand and volatility I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 7\u201317, N=11) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent lower-demand regime, which reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 7 (recorded previously). On-hand=26, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 0 and past confirms of 0 lead time, same-period arrivals are expected. I use default lead time (promised 0). For demand I rely on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 7\u201318) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 12 samples and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This keeps target stock aligned to the sustained lower demand, limiting holding cost while preserving service given current on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 0. Demand dropped sharply starting Period 7 and has stayed at a lower regime through Period 19. To adapt to the sustained lower-demand regime I set lead time to default (promised = 0) and use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to reflect the post-changepoint regime (use the most recent 13 periods to cover Periods 7\u201319). This reduces forecasting bias from the earlier high-demand weeks and helps the OR backend set a lower base stock to balance service level vs holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Lead time historically confirmed 0. To avoid overstocking given low demand and low holding cost, keep promised lead time. Use recent_N demand estimates based on the post-changepoint regime (Periods 7\u201321, length 15) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower, sustained demand.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Historical demand has been in the low regime since Period 7 (recorded earlier): recent weekly demand very low (many single-digit weeks). On-hand=25, in-transit=0 \u2014 on-hand covers multiple weeks at current demand, so avoid large replenishment. Lead time historically confirmed 0 periods; use promised/default. To capture the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (N=16 periods since Period 7) so the forecast reflects the lower mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=16 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base stock low to trade off holding cost vs service given low demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I use the promised lead time and set demand estimates based on the recent low-demand regime (use last 11 samples) so the OR engine targets a much lower base stock appropriate for current demand.

Given the long, sustained low-demand regime (Periods 7\u201324, regime length 18), I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=18 to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime (reduces ordering to avoid holding cost while preserving service for low demand). This balances profit per unit vs $1 holding cost by sizing base stock to recent lower mean and measured volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been in the low-regime identified earlier (Period 7 onward): last 5 concluded weekly demands = [1,2,0,1,6] (Periods 21\u201325) with mean \u22482.0 units/week. On-hand=20, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory covers many weeks at current demand. Lead time was previously confirmed as 0 periods. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I use a short-term recent forecast based on the last 5 weeks for both mean and volatility, and keep promised lead time (default=0).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand has been in the low regime identified earlier (carry-over: demand dropped at Period 7 and remained low). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the sustained low-demand regime: the most recent regime runs from Period 7 through Period 26 (20 periods available), so I choose N=20 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the last 20 samples. This keeps target inventory aligned with the lower demand pattern and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service given profit vs holding tradeoff.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201327), and prior carry-over noted a demand drop around Period 7 that persisted. Recent demand (Periods 22\u201327 = 2,0,1,6,21,32) shows elevated variability with two larger weeks but only two high points\u2014no sustained new regime (needs \u22653 periods). Use promised/default lead time to reflect confirmed L=0. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the backend adapt to the latest short-run mean/volatility while limiting influence of older high-demand months; this balances service (capture recent uptick risk) vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a 3-period uptick (Periods 26\u201328: 21,32,42) suggesting a regime change beginning Period 26. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To react quickly to the recent increase while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates based on the most recent 3 periods (capture the new regime). Thus L=default, mu_hat=recent_N with N=3, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3. This raises target base stock to serve the higher short-term demand while sigma_hat captures recent volatility so the OR backend can size safety stock appropriately.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg increased from 19.8 (Periods 7\u201311) to 31.7 (Periods 26\u201328), +60% (evidence: Periods 26\u201328 demands = 21,32,42).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand since Period 26 shows a sustained higher regime (Periods 26\u201329 demands = 21,32,42,37; mean=33). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. On-hand=12, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending. To target service for the new higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding, set L to default (promised 0). Forecast mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the confirmed regime ((1+L)*mean of last 4 = 33). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the new regime and limits buildup given low holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in P1\u2013P30 all concluded with lead_time=0). Recent demand shows a notable uptick starting Period 26 (carry-over already recorded) and a large single spike in Period 30 (demand=123, constrained by stock). To make the OR backend responsive to the most recent regime (Periods 26\u201330 = 21,32,42,37,123) I set L to default (promised lead time 0) because observed lead time is reliably 0, and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend bases the base-stock on the latest 5 periods which capture the new higher-variance regime while allowing the capped-order cap to limit extreme orders. This balances service (respond to higher recent demand) versus holding cost (by using only recent data and the cap).

Recent demand has risen sharply in the last 6 periods (Periods 26\u201331: 21,32,42,37,123,139) \u2014 I will target the recent sample window to reflect this regime. Set L to promised (0) since concluded evidence confirms 0. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent regime, balancing higher service level for the recent surge against holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Recent weeks (Periods 26\u201332) show a sustained demand increase versus earlier low regime (demands: 21,32,42,37,123,139,121) so I use recent data to forecast. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier), so keep default promised L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (Periods 26\u201332) to capture the new higher mean and volatility; this raises the base-stock to reduce stockouts given high recent spikes while the OR backend will cap orders. This balances service (profit $19) against holding cost $1 by reacting to the clear upward regime.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (P1\u2013P33). Demand has shifted sharply upward starting Period 30 (Periods 30\u201333 demands = 123,139,121,216; avg=149.75) vs prior recent regime (Periods 26\u201328 avg=31.7). I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0, confirmed). To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime (changepoint at Period 30) with N=4 (4 periods of sustained high demand). These parameters will raise the base-stock to meet the large current weekly demand while sigma_hat recent_N will reflect elevated volatility, balancing service (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given holding cost is low ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg increased from 31.7 (Periods 26\u201328) to 149.8 (Periods 30\u201333), +373% (evidence: Periods 30\u201333 demands = 123,139,121,216).

Demand shows a sustained high regime from Periods 30\u201334 (demands: 123,139,121,216,139). On-hand=85, in-transit=0; given the recent high and volatile demand, set lead time to promised (default) and use recent_N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime for both demand mean and volatility so the OR backend raises the base stock appropriately while accounting for variability.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P35 arrivals same period). Demand experienced a sustained high regime starting at Period 30 (Periods 30\u201335 demands = 123,139,121,216,139,104). On-hand=109, in-transit=0; to avoid stockouts in this higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (captures Periods 30\u201335 high-demand regime; N = max(min(regime_length=6,20),3)=6) so the backend builds a base-stock reflecting the new higher mean and recent volatility. This balances high service-level (high profit/higher critical fractile) against holding cost by anchoring forecasts to the confirmed, sustained high-demand regime.

Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 (use last 7 demand samples from the high regime) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the elevated demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent variability (includes the large spike in Period 33). These choices prioritize service (capture the high-demand regime) while allowing the OR backend cap to limit extreme orders and control holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand has been in the high regime since Period 30 (demands: 123,139,121,216,139,104,90,89). On-hand=111, in-transit=0; no shipments outstanding. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To target service in the current high-demand regime while limiting holding cost, set L to default (promised=0) and estimate demand using the most recent regime: use recent_N with N=8 (Periods 30\u201337) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap using the current high mean and observed volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=102, in-transit=0. Recent sustained demand regime (Period 30 onward) shows substantially higher weekly demand; last 9 periods (P30\u2013P38) average \u2248123.8 with high volatility. Lead time has been confirmed 0 historically, so use promised/default L to keep arrivals same-period. Use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the base-stock to the new high-demand regime (captures mean and volatility from the 9-period post-changepoint window). This increases target inventory to reduce stockouts given low on-hand vs. recent demand while letting the OR backend cap order size via its cap parameter to limit excess holding costs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=127, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals \u2192 actual lead time confirmed 0. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 30 (large weekly sales from P30\u2013P39), so I use recent data to forecast. Set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent elevated demand regime (last 10 periods) so the OR backend raises the base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs considered.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=132, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (arrivals match orders each concluded period). Demand shifted up starting Period 30 (Periods 30\u201333 avg\u2248149.8) then moderated but remains materially above earlier low regime. To capture the recent higher-demand regime while smoothing week-to-week noise I use a recent_N=8 window (covers recent periods ~P34\u2013P40) for both demand mean and volatility. L kept as default (promised=0) so OR engine treats arrivals as same-period; mu_hat and sigma_hat recent_N=8 will bias base-stock toward current elevated demand and help avoid stockouts given zero pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $709.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=146, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen materially vs. the high Sept peak: Periods 35\u201341 demands = [104,90,89,93,63,56,45] (avg \u224877.1) after the prior high-regime avg 149.8 (Periods 30\u201333). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate focused on the new lower regime: detect changepoint at Period 35, recent regime length = 7 periods, so set mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to target the current lower demand level across (1+L) review+lead horizon. For volatility I also use recent_N with N=7 to reflect current regime variability. These choices reduce overstocking versus using the older peak averages while preserving service using the observed 0 lead time and the current measured variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 35: avg decreased from 149.8 (Periods 30\u201333) to 77.1 (Periods 35\u201341), \u221248.5% (evidence: Periods 35\u201341 demands = 104,90,89,93,63,56,45).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 after a large sell-through in Period 42 (168 demand, likely Black Friday spike). Historical concluded lead time is consistently 0. To quickly replenish and reflect the recent high variability and elevated recent demand, keep L=default (promised=0) and use recent_N=6 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets ~95% service given high profit/holding tradeoff while capturing the recent surge (Periods 37\u201342). This balances avoiding costly stockouts after the spike versus holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Observed lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (multiple confirmations). Recent demand shows elevated and volatile weekly sales (Periods 40\u201343 = 56,45,168,65) including a large spike in Period 42 (likely holiday surge). To be responsive to current elevated regime while reflecting recent volatility, keep L at promised (0) and use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent std over the four most recent weeks.

Recent demand shows elevated regime around Periods 35\u201341 (avg~77) with a one-off spike in P42 (168) and moderate demands P43\u201344 (65,46). To balance service vs holding cost given high on-hand and recent elevated demand, use default promised lead time (0) and base forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current regime while limiting overreaction to the single spike. sigma_hat uses the same 5-week window to reflect recent volatility.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent weeks show elevated but volatile demand (Periods 43\u201345 demands = 65,46,85) after prior high/volatile autumn. On-hand=77, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Confirmed lead time historically = 0. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 43\u201345) to capture the current post-spike regime mean (\u224865.3) and avoid older regime dilution; this balances service (capture current elevated demand) vs. holding cost by not inflating the forecast with older high autumn peaks. Sigma uses recent_N N=3 to reflect current short-term volatility and drive safety stock in the OR backend.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed P1\u2013P46). Recent demand (Periods 43\u201346 = 65,46,85,93) is close to the post-peak regime (~77). No sustained new regime (need \u22653 periods of clear shift beyond noise). To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised lead time (default L=0) and a recent-demand-based mu_hat to emphasize latest demand patterns. I choose recent_N with N=8 to emphasize the most recent two-month window (captures the post-peak volatility including the large Period 42 spike but weights recent weeks more than the long historical average). sigma_hat uses default to let backend compute volatility from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L). These parameters balance service level (cover current period demand immediately since L=0) against holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.
