OR recommended 102 units (uses promised L and all historical samples equally). Reasoning: with profit=holding ($1 each) the OR's critical fractile implies minimal safety stock, but recent data indicate a sustained demand regime increase (3+ consecutive high weeks). To reduce high stockout risk given zero on-hand/pipeline, I increase the order to approximately the recent single-period mean (~130).
