Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 680262006 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0, and five recent weekly demand samples (52,69,123,141,125) through 2019-02-04. No 'Period conclude' messages are available to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Promised lead time is used (method=default) because there is no evidence to adjust it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a baseline forecast and safety stock consistent with historical variance while avoiding overreacting to limited data. This keeps ordering conservative given zero on-hand/pipeline and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand samples (52,69,123,141,125) have mean 102. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 order (ordered P1) arrived in P1, confirming actual lead time = 0 so promised lead time is valid. No sustained changepoint detected in demand (only 5 weeks of history), so use defaults: L default to promised lead time (0), mu_hat default -> (1+L)*mean of all samples, sigma_hat default -> sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This keeps the OR engine's base-stock anchored to observed historical mean while avoiding overfitting to very short recent fluctuations and accounting for confirmed zero lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean demand 102 units/week; recent two concluded periods had arrivals with lead_time=0 (Period1 and Period2), confirming actual lead time so far = 0. No sustained upward shift (only 2 high-demand weeks), so retain baseline demand estimate. Set L by averaging observed lead times. Use default population-based mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding=$1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical early-Jan mean demand=102 (5 samples). Recent Periods 1-3 demands = [127,165,168], recent mean \u2248153.3 (+50% vs earlier baseline) indicating a sustained upward demand regime (3 consecutive periods). All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0. To capture the recent higher demand while keeping variability calibrated, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. This raises base_stock to cover the higher observed demand while sigma reflects recent variability, balancing service level against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1: avg increased from 102 (2019-01 samples) to 153.3 (Periods 1-3) (+50.3%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $138.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows sustained higher demand since Period 1 (demands: P1=127, P2=165, P3=168, P4=146) and all concluded orders had lead_time=0. On-hand=8, in-transit=0 \u2014 risk of stockout given elevated demand. I keep L as default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. For demand I focus on the recent elevated regime: use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 1-4) to capture the sustained higher mean; same recent_N N=4 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices give the OR engine a forecast reflecting the new higher-demand regime while using confirmed lead-time behavior, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-5): [127,165,168,146,127], mean=146.6; on-hand=25, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. Use L=default (promised lead time=0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated recent regime (covers (1+L)\xd7recent mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. This keeps base-stock sized for the current higher-demand regime while avoiding reliance on older low-Jan samples and accounts for zero observed lead time.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand elevated vs. Jan baseline; last 5 realized demands (P2-P6) show average ~147 units/week. On-hand=16, in-transit=0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 -> use promised/observed immediate replenishment. Set L=default to keep backend lead-time at promised 0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent higher demand regime (avg \u2248147 over last 5 weeks) so base-stock targets service the (1+L) review+lead period. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand variability and prevent under/overstocking given equal profit and holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $140.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and recent demand has stabilized above the original baseline (Periods 1-7 demand: 127,165,168,146,127,131,144). On-hand=4, in-transit=0 so we are exposed to stockout this period. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the consistent 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use a recent_N approach (N=5, last 5 demand samples Periods 3-7 mean=143.2) to capture the elevated recent regime while avoiding older lower samples; mu_hat = (1+L)*recent mean. I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (meet elevated demand) while limiting excess holding by focusing on the most recent regime rather than all historical low-demand samples.

Historical concluded arrivals show all orders arrived with lead_time=0 consistently (Periods 1\u20138); demand recent weeks: 127,165,168,146,127,131,144,178 (no new sustained regime shift beyond previously recorded). Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples; this balances service vs holding cost given stable same-period lead time and the observed elevated demand levels.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history shows all observed lead_times = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P9 arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 => no arrivals expected this period. No overdue or missing shipments evident. I set L by 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time (will be 0). For demand I use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while keeping policy consistent with observed stable same-period fulfillment and balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1,$1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 6-10 = 131,144,178,136,81) shows higher mean and volatility versus the earliest samples and matches the previously recorded regime shift. To respond to the recent regime and volatility I set L=default (promised lead time=0) so arrivals remain same-period, use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base the forecast on the latest 5 weeks, and use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to recent demand while avoiding excess inventory given equal unit profit and holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times = 0 consistently, so keep L=default. Recent demand shows a higher, volatile regime vs. the Jan samples and the provided carry-over insight (regime shift starting Period 1). Use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the current regime and volatility; choose N=5 (most recent 5 demand observations) to balance responsiveness and sample size. This increases service against stockouts while containing holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 keep promised lead time. Recent demand has softened: last 3 concluded demands = [81,83,97], recent mean ~87 vs long-run mean ~138; I treat this as a recent regime for forecasting. Therefore set L=default (promised=0). Use recent_N N=3 for mu_hat to make (1+L)\xd7forecast reflect the recent lower demand, and recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given profit=holding cost parity.

Recent demand has softened versus the earlier spike\u2014last 5 concluded demands = [136,81,83,97,74], average \u224894.2. I choose L=default (use promised lead time=0).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0 in all past periods; recent demand has moderated after earlier peak (recent weekly sales mostly 50\u201383). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed fast replenishment and stable recent demand, use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility estimators so backend computes (1+L)*mean and \u221a(1+L)*std from all samples. This maintains service with minimal holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Current on-hand=44, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible this period. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period (orders placed arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demands (Periods 10-15) are lower than the early spike but not a sustained regime shift requiring adjustment beyond existing carry-over insight. To let the OR backend compute the appropriate base-stock and cap with full historical statistics, use default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples are applied. This balances service level (using full-sample estimates) against holding cost given current moderate on-hand inventory and profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has declined vs. early-period spike; ending on-hand=77, in-transit=0 so we should avoid heavy replenishment. All observed lead times concluded as 0 periods (no evidence of delays). Use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast use recent_N=5 (Periods 12-16 demands = 97,74,83,75,40; mean ~73.8) to capture the recent lower regime and reduce overstock risk. Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep base_stock aligned with recent demand and limit holding costs given profit=holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent on-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently (orders in Periods 1\u201316 all concluded with lead_time=0; Period 17 ordered=0). Demand has trended down in recent periods (Periods 13\u201317 demands = 74,83,75,40,29), indicating a lower recent mean than earlier spikes. I therefore keep L at default (promised lead time = 0) since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the clear recent lower-demand regime (regime length = 5 periods, N=5). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce ordering to match lower recent demand and limit holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

On-hand = 32, in-transit = 0; no overdue arrivals. Use promised lead time (default 0). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent downshift and avoid overstocking; set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce holding cost risk while preserving service for current lower demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand has fallen from the earlier high regime; latest 5 concluded weekly demands = [75, 40, 29, 29, 24] (mean ~39.4). On-hand=28, in-transit=0 and no overdue arrivals visible. I set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because all concluded history shows same-period arrivals and no evidence of sustained lead-time drift. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime (gives (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent 5 weeks), reducing overstock risk versus using the full-sample mean. This balances service (covering imminent demand) against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 -> conservative safety stock).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

On-hand=30, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected. Use promised lead time (default L=0) because all concluded orders show lead_time=0. To avoid overstock given lower recent demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the new low-demand regime and recent volatility) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant samples.

All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders historically arrive same period). To avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding, I target the recent lower-demand regime by using recent_N for demand mean and volatility so the backend sizes base-stock to match current lower demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Recent demand has declined versus spring: Periods 16-24 demand series = [40,29,29,24,10,20,11,9,6] (n=9). No evidence of lead-time change (all concluded arrivals showed lead_time=0). To capture the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets lower (1+L)-period demand and reduced safety stock; keep L=default (promised lead time=0) since observed lead times remain 0. This balances avoiding overstock (holding=$1) while maintaining service given current low demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=11, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has settled at lower weekly levels since Period 16 (many small orders); no new sustained changepoint detected. I select L=default to use promised lead time (0). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages the full sample set given no new regime requiring recent-only estimates and matches the backend's base-stock logic (profit=holding \u2192 q=0.5, conservative stocking). This keeps orders small matching current low demand and avoids excess holding cost given on-hand=11 and zero in-transit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0; recent demand has fallen (Periods 22-26 demands = 11,9,6,11,4) versus earlier high-season levels. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) since concluded data confirms 0. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid overstocking. I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so variability estimate matches the recent low-demand sample. These choices lower the base-stock and cap to reduce holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0 (orders placed previously arrived same period), and recent demand has settled lower after the early-year spike. No evidence of lost shipments or sustained lead-time change. Use default lead time (promised 0) so backend uses full-sample mean; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples are applied, balancing service level vs holding cost given current on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. On-hand=74, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent lead_time=0 (all arrived same period), so use 'calculate' (avg observed = 0). Recent demand has declined through summer (many low-demand weeks) but the long-run sample set includes earlier higher-demand weeks; to balance service vs holding cost use default demand/volatility estimators so OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps orders conservative given current on-hand buffer and $1 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02. Recent demand has fallen and stabilized at low levels since late May (Periods 16\u201329: mostly 4\u201329 units/week), while lead time has consistently concluded as 0. On-hand=72, in-transit=0, profit and holding cost equal so service/holding tradeoff is balanced. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because concluded history shows lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (covering the recent low-demand regime from Period 16\u201329) so mu_hat reflects the current lower mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=14 to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce ordering to match the sustained lower demand and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service level.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical winter/spring regime earlier is recorded, but the last 5 demand samples (Periods 26-30 = 4,13,6,5,11) show a much lower summer demand regime. To avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1), use promised lead time (default) and base forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect current low-demand regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This reduces order targets and limits holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has been low and stable (last 5 weeks: 13,6,5,11,8; mean\u22488.6). On-hand=53, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover versus current weekly demand. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Forecast demand using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new low-demand regime and avoid excess stock; keep sigma as default to reflect overall historical variability. This keeps base_stock tight (reduces holding cost) while preserving service for steady low demand.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been low (last several weeks: 11,8,3) and on-hand=50, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and historical concluded lead times are 0. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend assumes same-period arrivals. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by (1+L)) and default volatility to let backend compute base-stock from full historical samples\u2014this is conservative given the earlier documented upward regime but recent realized demand has softened. These settings avoid forcing extra pipeline when on-hand is ample, balancing profit vs. holding cost.

Recent demand has been low (Periods 26-33 average demand \u2248 7.6) but earlier periods had higher regime; no new sustained changepoint (needs 3+ periods of consistent shift) beyond the previously recorded regime shift. Use default lead time (promised L=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full sample mean/variance ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std).

To avoid excess holding cost given current low weekly demand, use promised lead time (default) and base demand estimates on the recent regime: use recent_N with N=10 to capture the latest lower-demand behavior for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets lower replenishment and reduces holding risk.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has been low and stable since mid-2019 (many single-digit weekly sales from Periods ~17\u201336), while earlier Jan samples were much higher. On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and historical concluded lead times are 0, so keep L=default. To avoid overstock during the current low-demand regime, use recent_N demand estimates that focus on the most recent sustained low-demand periods (capture up to 20 recent samples). Thus set mu_hat using recent_N (N=20) and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=20) so the OR backend will size base stock to current low regime and reduce unnecessary holding costs given profit=holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2014 keep promised lead time. Demand has trended down since mid\u2010year; recent weeks show much lower sales than early-year peak. To avoid excess holding cost and reflect the current low-demand regime, use recent_N demand estimates based on the most recent 20 weeks. Set L=default, mu_hat=recent_N (N=20), sigma_hat=recent_N (N=20). This reduces target base-stock to match recent demand while preserving service tradeoff.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been low (last 5 concluded demands: 8,3,8,10,9; mean=7.6) after the earlier regime shift recorded in carry-over. No evidence of lead-time change (all concluded lead_times=0). To avoid excess holding cost while meeting near-term demand, keep promised lead time (default=0) and set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks (recent_N N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stocking for the current low-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has fallen to a low, stable regime (weeks ~16\u201339 show much lower weekly sales than the early-year peak). On-hand=35, in-transit=0 so current coverage is limited. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the recent low-demand regime I use a recent_N forecast over the last 20 concluded demand samples (balances responsiveness and sample size). Volatility likewise set from the recent 20 samples. These parameters reduce order quantities versus the high-demand spring regime, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for the current lower demand environment.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Current on-hand=31, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 (no delayed/lost shipments), so keep promised lead time. Demand has fallen materially since spring: recent weekly sales (Periods 31-40) average very low (3-11 units) vs. earlier high season. I detect a sustained low-demand regime in the most recent ~10 periods, so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect current lower mean and volatility (N=10). This keeps the OR base-stock tight (lower holding cost) while preserving service for current low demand. No indication of delayed or lost orders to warrant changing L.

To avoid excess holding (holding cost = profit), use promised lead time (default). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce future overstock while keeping some safety stock given variability.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=0 (many arrivals recorded same period). Recent demand last 5 concluded periods (P38-P42): [9,3,4,6,30] \u2014 spike at P42 likely promotional/holiday but not yet a sustained regime shift. To balance fill-rate vs holding cost I use promised lead time (default L=0) and recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 to capture very recent demand including the spike while keeping responsiveness low. N=5 chosen per recent-data rule (use most recent regime; min 3, capped at 20). This raises the forecast above long-run low summer demand while keeping safety stock reasonable given profit=holding ($1/$1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders have lead_time 0). Recent demand has been low with occasional spikes (e.g., Period 42 demand=30) but no sustained new regime beyond the previously recorded shift. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand, I select default lead time and default demand estimates so the engine uses all historical samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service (uses full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost given current low pipeline and small on-hand stock.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods, so use default promised L. Recent demand has been low with a single stockout spike (Periods 40-44 demands = 4,6,30,3,4). To reflect the current low-demand regime while retaining sensitivity to the recent spike, I use a recent_N=5 demand estimate (captures last 5 weeks) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps target base-stock low to avoid holding cost while covering short-term variability around current observed demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P41-P45 demands = 6,30,3,4,6) is lower and volatile after the November spike; to reflect the latest regime while still smoothing noise, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5. Use default sigma (all-sample std scaled) to let OR backend capture overall volatility. This balances service (cover near-term low demand) vs holding cost given limited on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

Recent demand has been low-to-moderate with occasional spikes (e.g., Period 42 demand=30) but no sustained new regime since prior carry-over insight. I choose L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, yielding a balanced base-stock given profit=holding (q=0.5 => z*=0). This approach avoids overreacting to isolated spikes while keeping service level aligned with historical variance.
