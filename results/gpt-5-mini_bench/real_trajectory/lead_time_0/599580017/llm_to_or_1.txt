Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward regime: samples 2019-01-21:61, 2019-01-28:98, 2019-02-04:152. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need to replenish for current+lead demand. I use L=default (promised lead time=0). For demand I focus on the recent 3-week regime (N=3) because there are 3 consecutive higher-demand weeks; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to capture the new mean and volatility and avoid being pulled to earlier zeros. This biases ordering toward the observed higher demand while keeping variability estimated from the same regime, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04: avg increased from 0 (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14) to 103.67 (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent concluded history shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived with lead_time=0 and demand regime shift on 2019-01-21\u21922019-02-04 (avg ~103.7) is already recorded. On-hand=50, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Use promised/default lead time (L=default) because observed lead time matches promised (0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures the recent regime via the full-sample statistics while keeping policy simple). This balances service (profit$19 vs holding$1) by letting the OR engine set base stock using demand mean and variability.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1 and 2 arrived with lead_time=0 (confirmed same-period arrivals). Recent demand has shifted upward vs early Jan: the higher-demand regime is supported by the three samples 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 and by high sales in Periods 1\u20132. To capture the new higher demand while keeping variability local, set L to the observed average lead time (calculate). For demand, use recent_N with N=3 to focus the base-stock on the confirmed elevated regime; match sigma to recent variability with N=3. These choices raise the base_stock appropriately for the sustained demand increase while avoiding over-weighting older zero-demand periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Observed concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 in Periods 1-3. Demand has stepped up recently (last 3 demands = 129, 213, 175; mean ~172). To reflect the recent higher demand and short lead time, set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the current regime while capping orders via its cap rule.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3218.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent weeks show elevated, stable demand after the Jan-Feb regime shift (recent demands: 129,213,175,173). On-hand=69, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0, so set L via calculate to confirm actual lead time. To capture the new higher-demand regime, forecast using recent data: set mu_hat recent_N with N=4 (uses the last 4 demand samples) and set sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting the elevated demand while keeping holding cost modest given current on-hand stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3391.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has settled into a higher regime (periods 1\u20135 demands: 129,213,175,173,181) vs earlier near-zero weeks. On-hand=48, in-transit=0; with confirmed same-period arrivals historically we should assume short lead time. I set L by averaging observed lead times (calculate) to capture confirmed 0-period realizations. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (stable over 5 periods). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices yield a base_stock tuned to the current high-demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive to recent variance, balancing service and holding cost given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1\u2013P5 orders arrived same period; lead_time=0 each conclude).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent realized demand has been high and stable (last 6 period demands = 129,213,175,173,181,200; avg \u2248 178). On-hand=24, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in conclues. To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (last N=6). L uses default (promised lead time=0) consistent with observed conclues. These parameters raise the (1+L)\xd7forecast to meet current weekly demand while sigma from recent data shapes safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent realized demand has risen markedly (period sold series: 129,213,175,173,181,200,268) and on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the higher recent regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default. Use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last 7 observed weeks (captures the sustained higher demand and rising trend). This raises the backend base-stock to protect service while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility; default L keeps arrivals same-period per confirmed evidence.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand has trended sharply upward (period demands: 129,213,175,173,181,200,268,376) and current on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods, so use promised/default L. To capture the recent high-demand regime and elevated volatility, set demand forecast and volatility based on the most recent 5 periods (captures the upward trend while smoothing older low values). These parameters bias the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given zero observed lead time, while sigma from recent data informs safety stock and the cap limits excessive ordering and holding cost exposure.

Historical concludes confirm lead time=0 consistently. To maintain service while containing holding cost, use promised lead time (default) and let OR compute base-stock and volatility from full sample history (default mu_hat and default sigma_hat). This balances higher mean demand and variability without over-riding OR's cap logic.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand has risen and become more volatile (last 5 sold: 268,376,295,367,477). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need coverage for current period plus lead. Lead time historically confirmed 0. I choose L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher mean over the most recent 5 weeks. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect the increased volatility. These parameters focus the OR backend on a higher base-stock to avoid costly stockouts during the recent demand surge while using an empirical volatility estimate to limit overstocking given $1 holding cost vs $19 profit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and a sustained demand regime increase since 2019-01-21; recent weeks show high weekly demand (periods 8-12 demands: 376,295,367,477,468). I set L=default to reflect the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time. I use recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated demand regime (last 5 observed demands) so the OR backend raises target base-stock and safety stock accordingly, balancing higher service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=190, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments (lead time historically 0). Demand has been high and volatile in recent weeks (multiple 200\u2013499 draws). Use promised lead time to match observed 0. For demand forecast, use a recent-window to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; choose recent_N with N=10 to weight the last 10 samples. Apply same recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (capture current high demand) versus holding cost by not inflating forecast with older low-demand samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been elevated and variable (last 6 period demands: 295, 367, 477, 468, 332, 417; avg\u2248392.7). No overdue shipments observed; historical concludes confirm lead time=0. To keep service while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time (default) and base stock driven by the recent 6-period demand mean and volatility so the OR backend reacts to the current higher-demand regime.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent demand has settled at a higher regime vs early Feb. On-hand=145, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; I therefore keep promised lead time. I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 weeks: demands 477,468,332,417,370 \u2192 mean \u2248412.8) to capture the current high-demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead period. Volatility is estimated from the same recent 5-week window to reflect current variation. These choices keep base-stock aligned to current demand spikes while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples; with L=0 this prioritizes service while limiting holding cost given on-hand is already 145.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent weeks show sustained high weekly demand (multiple 300\u2013525 samples). Promised lead time has consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 8 demand samples (captures ~2 months of higher summer swimwear demand). This balances service (higher forecast to avoid stockouts) against holding cost by using a recent-window mean/volatility rather than the long-run low-demand average.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=207, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time=0) and sustained higher demand since 2019-01-21. To let the OR engine use full history and current confirmed lead time, I select default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level against holding cost given current inventory.

Recent demand (last 5 periods: 370, 525, 330, 302, 517) averages ~409 units/week; using recent_N=5 captures current demand level and volatility. Keep lead time at default (promised 0) since concludes confirm L=0. These parameters target service while limiting excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime and volatility, set demand estimates based on the most recent 10 samples (balances responsiveness vs noise). These parameters raise the base-stock to cover current high demand while accounting for variability.

Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=87, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time=0 and a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21. Recent weeks (Periods 14\u201321) show elevated and volatile weekly demand (several weeks >400, spike to 771). To keep service while limiting holding cost, use recent demand to size (1+L)\xd7mean and recent volatility for safety. No evidence of lost shipments. Selected L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent demand regime (N=8 covers ~2 months of recent weeks including the high-variance summer spike), which balances responsiveness to increased demand and avoids overreacting to single-week spikes.

Demand has been elevated and variable since the Jan regime shift; recent weeks show high weekly demand (Periods 15\u201322 include several large demands and replenishments). To capture current high-demand regime while limiting sensitivity to single-week spikes, I use a recent-window forecast focusing on the most recent 8 weeks to set demand mean and volatility. Keep L=default (promised 0) since concludes consistently show 0. Recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances responsiveness to the current high-demand regime with noise reduction, helping the OR backend target service while controlling holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=7, in-transit=0; recent 12 periods (P13\u2013P24) show a sustained high-demand regime vs early-year lows. Lead times have been consistently 0 in concluded history. Use promised/default lead time to reflect confirmed 0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine raises base-stock and cap appropriately to avoid stockouts while accounting for holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=432, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent weeks (Periods 19\u201325) show elevated summer demand vs earlier in year, so use a recent-window demand estimate to capture current regime. Choose L=default (promised 0). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to focus forecast on the most recent high-demand weeks and reduce bias from earlier low-demand periods. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps service high during peak season while limiting extra holding cost by using a targeted recent sample.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=631, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history; keep L as default (promised=0). Recent demand is elevated and variable (summer swimwear season); use recent_N for demand estimates to capture latest regime. I choose N=8 (captures the last 8 weekly demands, balanced between recency and sample size) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sets a base-stock that reflects current higher mean and volatility while controlling holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent weeks show sustained elevated summer demand with high variability but all concluded orders have lead_time=0. On-hand=706, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is ample vs recent demand. Use default lead time (promised 0; historical confirms 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample statistics to compute base-stock and cap; this leverages the long history to set an appropriate safety stock given the high service-level implied by profit/holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Historical actual lead time confirmed as 0; recent demand has fallen from midsummer peaks (Periods 24-28: 710,309,176,132,155). On-hand is high (551) and in-transit=0, so avoid inflating pipeline. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Forecast demand using most recent 5 weeks to capture current lower regime (recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR engine targets a smaller base-stock and reduces holding cost while preserving service given high q (~0.95). No explicit mu/sigma values provided\u2014let backend compute from recent data.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). On-hand=555, in-transit=0. Lead time history shows consistent 0-period arrivals; no evidence of shift, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has fallen from mid-summer peaks; last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 25\u201329 = 309,176,132,155,139) average ~182 units. I choose mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. These settings keep base-stock aligned with current demand to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given lead time=0.

On-hand=528, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage vs one-period demand but we should adapt forecasts to lower recent demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so use default promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the clear downward regime over the last 5 periods and to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

On-hand=493, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage versus current low demand, but we must still size (1+L) demand. Historical concludes confirm lead time=0; no evidence of new lost shipments. I set L to default (promised 0). To reflect the recent low-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the last 5 samples, which reduces target base stock and holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Historical concludes show lead time consistently 0 (confirmed earlier) and a clear demand regime shift after late July: recent demand has fallen from summer peaks to a lower steady level (recent weekly demands: 139,78,65,30,35,62). I treat the current regime as the recent low-demand regime and use recent_N=7 to capture latest mean/volatility while keeping responsiveness to continued downtrend. L uses default (promised=0) because concluded history confirms 0. These parameters reduce target base-stock and cap order sizes to limit holding cost while preserving enough stock to meet near-term demand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14. Recent demand has declined sharply since late July/Aug (Periods 26\u201335) with sustained lower weekly sales (~30\u201380). On-hand=393, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to recent demand so avoid inflating lead-time or demand estimates. Use promised lead time (default L=0). For demand forecast and volatility use recent regime (Periods 26\u201335) to reflect the sustained lower demand: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (captures the 10 most recent periods, balancing recency and sample size). This reduces ordering vs. earlier high-season rates and limits holding cost while maintaining service for current lower demand.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. Recent demand has dropped sharply and stayed low since Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand is 350, in-transit 0 \u2014 ample coverage for current low demand. Lead time historically confirmed as 0; no new lead-time evidence. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (the sustained low-demand regime from Period 28\u201336) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of those 9 recent samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=9 to capture recent volatility. This reduces ordering to match the new lower regime, lowering holding cost while maintaining service for current demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 28 (2019-08-19): avg decreased from 424.43 (Periods 21\u201327) to 71.67 (Periods 28\u201336), a ~83% drop.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=300, in-transit=0. Recent sustained demand regime is the lower regime starting 2019-08-19 (Periods 28\u201337) \u2014 mean demand has been much lower than earlier summer. No new evidence of lead-time change; keep promised lead time. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility with N equal to the recent regime length (10 periods) so the OR backend will size base stock to current lower demand and avoid excessive holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent sustained demand regime (since Period 28) shows much lower weekly demand (~30\u2013155, avg ~71.67 previously recorded). On-hand=264, in-transit=0 and many zero orders since Period 28 indicate lower demand and possible deliberate stop of replenishment. No new lead-time evidence; prior lead time confirmed as 0. I set L to default (promised lead time=0). For demand I use recent_N over the current low-demand regime to reflect the persistent drop: choose N=11 (Periods 28\u201338 available in this regime). Use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the low-demand regime, reducing excess replenishment and holding cost while preserving service. Carry-over insight unchanged.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Current on-hand=230, in-transit=0. Demand has been in the low regime since 2019-08-19 (Period 28); recent weekly demand samples (Periods 28\u201339) are much lower than earlier summer peaks. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N over the most recent regime: N=12 (Periods 28\u201339) for both mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat capture the new lower mean and reduced variance. This keeps orders small (on-hand already covers multiple weeks), lowering holding cost while maintaining service for current low demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18): on-hand=188, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 28 (2019-08-19) with low weekly demand (~30\u201380) since then. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To align forecasts with the recent low-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 (Periods 29\u201340) to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent stable low-demand samples.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 28 (multiple periods of much smaller weekly demand). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To capture the new low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime data: recent_N with N=14 (Periods 28\u201341) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of recent samples and volatility from the same window. L kept as default (promised lead time 0) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. This keeps orders aligned to the reduced demand while preserving service level and minimizing holding costs given current on-hand=171 and no in-transit units.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 and historical concludes consistently show 0 lead time \u2014 use default lead time. Demand fell sharply at Period 28 and has stayed in the lower post-Period-28 regime through Period 42 (15 periods); use a recent_N forecast to capture the current lower demand level (N=15). Use recent_N for sigma to capture recent volatility including the Period 42 spike. These settings keep orders responsive to the current low-demand regime while the OR backend will compute service-driven base-stock and cap with the recent mean/volatility.

Demand experienced a sustained downshift at Period 28 (avg fell sharply) and recent weeks remain in the lower regime with intermittent spikes (Period 42 demand=113). To keep service while limiting holding cost, I use a recent-window forecast to reflect the current low-demand regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the last N samples to react to current demand level while L uses observed average lead time.

Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 28 with some holiday-week spikes (e.g., P42 demand=113). To balance service vs holding cost I use lead-time estimate from observed history and focus demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime while smoothing over short holiday spikes: L: calculate (uses observed lead times, yields 0). mu_hat: recent_N N=12 to capture the most recent low-demand regime (includes recent holiday variability). sigma_hat: recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility including holiday spike.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=30, in-transit=0. Historical lead times have consistently concluded as 0; demand experienced a sustained down-shift around 2019-08-19 (documented) and recent weeks show lower demand (last 6 demands: 42,17,113,51,57,58; avg \u224856). I therefore keep lead time at the promised/default (0) and use a recent_N estimate for demand (N=6) to reflect the current low-demand regime. I also use recent_N for sigma to capture current volatility over the same window. These choices reduce over-ordering given limited pipeline and lower recent demand while preserving service level for near-term demand.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 \u2014 use promised/default L=0. Demand experienced a large drop around 2019-08-19 and has stayed at the lower regime since; recent weeks (last ~12 periods) show lower mean but some holiday variability (Nov-Dec spike week). To capture the current low-demand regime while responding to recent holiday volatility, I use a recent_N forecast over the last 12 samples for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets base-stock to (1+L)*recent mean and scales safety stock to recent volatility. This balances service (covers short holiday upswing risk) vs holding cost given modest on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.
