Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 1, pipeline = 0. Recent demand has been in a sustained holiday spike (Periods 33\u201345 include many high weeks: e.g., P42 demand=682, P45 demand=420) so current demand risk is much higher than pre-spike levels. OR recommends 415 using historical averages and promised lead time; that recommendation is sensible but slightly conservative given last observed sell of 420 in P45 and ongoing holiday season (2019/12/23). Final strategy: increase OR recommendation modestly to 420 units to cover expected high-period demand while keeping holding costs low relative to profit (profit $19 >> holding $1). This ensures on-hand after arrival \u2248421, enough to meet a high-demand week similar to P45 without drastic overstock. Follow-up: monitor P46 conclude for realized demand and arrivals to adjust future orders.",
