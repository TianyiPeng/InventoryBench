Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) show variable demand with a recent high (17\u201334) but sample size is small; no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Promised lead time is used (default) because there is no evidence to estimate an alternative lead time or lost shipments. Use default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation while we gather arrival/lead-time signals in future periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand has jumped: historical weekly samples before 2019-01-21 were very low (1,3) but from 2019-01-21 onward demand has been consistently higher (27,17,34,43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and last order (Period 1) confirmed lead time 0. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (samples 2019-01-21 through Period 1) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)-period demand under the new regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=4 to estimate volatility from the same recent regime. These choices raise target base-stock to satisfy elevated demand while keeping holding costs informed by recent variance.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: prior avg (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14)=2.0 units/week vs recent avg (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-11)=30.25 units/week (+1412.5%), sustained for 4 consecutive weeks

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals observed (both prior orders had lead_time=0). Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (much higher weekly demand). I set L via 'calculate' to use the observed lead-times (both concluded as 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (use the last 4 weeks of demand samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std), which raises the base-stock to service elevated demand while keeping variance estimate anchored to the new regime. This balances higher service level needed after the regime shift against holding cost growth.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent sells exhausted each period. Concluded history shows actual lead times observed = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P3 arrived same period). Demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 is sustained (high weekly demand: samples since 01-21 and recent period demands are much larger than pre-01-21). Set L by calculating average observed lead time (reflects confirmed 0). For demand (mu_hat, sigma_hat) use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime while limiting noise from older low-demand weeks\u2014this raises base_stock to meet the sustained higher demand and reduces expected stockouts while accepting higher holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded demands show a sustained high-demand regime since 2019-01-21 (periods with demand 43,179,136,67); on-hand=75, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time=0 and all concluded lead times=0 so use default L to keep model aligned with promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime reflected in the last 4 periods (balances higher service need vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1). This keeps base stock responsive to the elevated demand while avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime vs earlier baseline (large, multi-week demands in Periods 2-5). On-hand=124, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. All historical concludes show orders arriving same period => actual lead time confirmed as 0. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, I use the recent-demand regime for forecast: set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 0), use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher mean and volatility from the last 4 observed demand periods (Periods 2\u20135). This biases the base-stock toward satisfying the new regime while limiting overreaction to older low-demand samples.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent weeks show elevated, sustained demand vs early-Jan baseline (carry-over insight records the regime shift starting 2019-01-21). On-hand=108, in-transit=0 \u2192 healthy on-hand but no pipeline; past 6 concluded periods show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime using the last 6 weeks of realized demand (this focuses the forecast on the sustained elevated demand and recent variability). This balances service (meet current high demand) while avoiding excess holding by relying on recent data rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=94, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 \u2192 set L by calculating observed lead times. Recent demand (Periods 3\u20137 = 136,67,35,52,41) shows a higher, but variable regime versus earlier samples; I use a recent_N=5 forecast to capture the current mean demand level while keeping variability estimates responsive. This balances service (capture elevated recent mean) against holding cost by limiting horizon to the most recent 5 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders placed arrived same period). Demand has settled into a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (earlier carry-over note). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 4-8) = [67,35,52,41,99], mean=58.8; volatility present. With promised lead time 0 and confirmed same-period arrivals, I set L=default to keep lead-time = promised (0). I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime and keep service during volatile weeks. I set sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. This balances higher service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while limiting excess inventory given observed demand variability and current low on-hand (2) and no in-transit.

Recent demand (Periods 1-9) is elevated vs early-sample prior; mean of last 9 concluded weekly demands \u224876 units/week. To reflect the sustained higher regime and recent volatility while keeping safety against stockouts, I set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=9) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent std. This balances service (avoid lost sales given high recent demand) against holding cost given current on-hand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders in Period X arrived in Period X), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 4\u201310 = 67,35,52,41,99,32,23) reflects the current regime (post-Jan spike) and is more relevant than the early extreme spikes in Periods 2\u20133. I therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 7 observed demand periods to capture current mean/variance for the (1+L) review+lead horizon; this balances service (capturing recent variability) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand history shows a prior sustained regime shift to much higher weekly demand (early Mar-Apr peaks) but the last 3 weeks have moderated (32, 23, 24). On-hand=73, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Use promised lead time (default L=0) since concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0. For demand forecast use EWMA to weight recent weeks more while retaining higher earlier weeks (gamma=0.3). For volatility use recent 5 weeks to reflect current variability. These settings keep target base-stock responsive to recent decline while preserving safety from earlier high-demand periods, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=51, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 when arrivals occurred (periods 1\u201310), and recent orders (P11\u2013P12) show no arrivals because none were placed. Demand showed a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (high demand through March), then moderated in April\u2013May. To be responsive to the current (more recent) demand level while retaining short promised lead time, I use promised lead time (default) but base demand estimates on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the post-spike moderation. Recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) will let the OR backend scale base stock to recent demand volatility and avoid excessive holding given positive holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spike; last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 9-13) = [32,23,24,22,8], recent mean ~21.8. No evidence of delayed/lost shipments (concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently). Use promised lead time (default=0) to keep backend expectations aligned. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduce excess ordering vs using the full-sample high-spike history.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 (orders placed each period that arrived same period) so I will let L be inferred from observed data. Recent demand since Period 3 shows higher sustained demand vs the tiny Jan samples; however a carry-over insight already records that regime shift. To balance service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (q=0.8 -> high service target), use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses full sample history to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps orders responsive to the confirmed higher demand while relying on backend cap to limit extreme orders. No in-transit inventory to cover current period demand, so maintaining backend-calculated base-stock is appropriate.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 so use promised/default L=0. Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 is sustained (much higher weekly demand since then), so use recent_N to base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent data rather than the older low-demand samples. I choose N=12 (uses last 12 periods) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping N within available sample count. This increases forecasted (1+L)-period demand and estimated volatility, trading higher service level for holding cost given strong recent demand and zero observed lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and very volatile recent demand (last 4 demands = 8,23,18,93) with a large recent spike (Period 16=93). Promised lead time has consistently observed 0 in concluded history, so keep L=default. To react to recent regime and spike, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 (captures current mean \u224835.5 for (1+L) periods). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to cover the recent surge while sigma captures uncertainty to avoid stockouts without excessive holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent observed demand is elevated and volatile (most recent 5 weekly demands: 8, 23, 18, 93, 69) with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments visible in concludes. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0. To respond to the recent higher, variable demand while avoiding excessive holding cost, I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock is driven by the latest regime. L uses default (promised lead time=0) since concluded arrivals all show 0 and there is no evidence of lost/delayed shipments.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use promised lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (much higher weekly demand since then); recent realized weekly demand remains elevated and variable (several weeks with demand 52\u201399 and multiple stockouts). I set L=default to reflect the promised 0-period lead time. For forecasting I use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the base-stock calculation on the post-changepoint high-demand regime while keeping N large enough to smooth week-to-week volatility. This balances higher service-level needs (avoid stockouts given frequent sell-throughs) against holding cost by relying on recent demand evidence rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 for all observed orders (ordered and arrived same period). Demand history exhibits a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 already recorded in carry-over. Given clear same-period arrivals and no evidence of lost/delayed shipments, use default recommended settings so the OR engine computes base_stock from promised lead time and full-sample demand stats; this balances service level using all available demand history while avoiding overfitting to very recent noise.

Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (carry-over insight). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default=0) and base demand on the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from the last 12 observed demand periods to capture the sustained elevated mean and volatility. N=12 balances responsiveness to the higher regime with smoothing over several weeks.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and all concluded orders show lead_time=0 (no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (already recorded). Recent weeks (Apr\u2013Jul) show elevated and variable weekly demand relative to pre-shift samples; to focus the forecast on the most relevant recent regime and limit dilution from early low samples, I use a recent_N estimate for demand mean and volatility using the last 12 weekly samples. L kept as default (promised=0) because concluded lead times remain 0. This gives the OR engine a demand estimate tuned to the current high-demand regime while relying on observed on-time delivery performance to trust lead time.

On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need the OR engine to size orders to the elevated demand. All concluded lead times have been 0, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving the confirmed demand regime in the statistics and letting the OR engine calculate the appropriate base-stock and cap.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for all observed orders (orders placed each period have arrived same period). Demand has been in the elevated regime recorded earlier (shift starting 2019-01-21). No overdue or missing shipments visible. Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand stats so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this lets the OR engine apply its profit/holding tradeoff automatically.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=7, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across many periods. Recent demand has been in a higher regime for many weeks (sustained high weekly sales through Period 25). To capture the current high-demand regime I set L via observed history and use recent_N for demand estimates to focus the forecast on the latest 20 weeks of demand, and the same window for volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by using a rolling recent demand estimate rather than the long-run average.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-08-12: on-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=0, so use promised lead time. Demand has been in a sustained high regime since 2019-01-21 (noted previously) and recent weeks show stable high weekly demand (~70-100). To keep service and avoid stockouts given profit=4 vs holding=1, I use a recent-window forecast to reflect current regime: set L=default, mu_hat=recent_N (capture recent mean over last 20 weeks), sigma_hat=recent_N (capture recent std over last 20 weeks). This biases orders toward meeting ongoing high demand while keeping volatility estimated from recent data.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0; demand has remained in the elevated regime since the Jan 2019 changepoint. To reflect sustained higher recent demand and recent variability, use recent_N methods over a long recent window (N=20) so mu_hat and sigma_hat track the current high-demand regime while keeping L as default (promised=0). This balances service (capture higher mean) against holding cost by letting OR backend compute base_stock using recent demand estimates.

Recent demand history shows sustained higher weekly demand since late Jan (carry-over insight present), but no new changepoint since last insight. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set; this leverages all data and lets the OR engine balance the high profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Demand has remained in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained high weekly sales through recent months); to capture the current demand level and recent variability I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime samples.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Demand since the large early-2019 regime shift has been steady at higher weekly levels; recent weeks show moderate variability. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms it. For forecasting I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the current high-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand samples. Same recent_N N=20 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep base-stock tied to current realized demand, limiting overstock while protecting service given current variability.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23. Recent weekly demand has stabilized in the 30\u2013100 range with the last 8 concluded demands: 57,37,36,80,102,79,94,90 (recent weeks average ~70 but last 4 weeks lower ~42); on-hand=65, in-transit=0. Promised lead time remains 0 and recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals. I keep L='default' (use promised lead time=0). To capture the current demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (balances medium-term stability vs recent decline). These parameters direct the OR engine to set base-stock reflecting the last 8-week mean (scaled by 1+L) and to use recent volatility for safety stock, avoiding excess holding given $1 holding cost while preserving service given $4 profit. No evidence of lost shipments or new sustained lead-time shifts.

Date 2019-10-14. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (many periods with arrived=ordered same period). Current on-hand=13, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 31-35) shows a lower, stable weekly demand regime (~37 avg); use recent_N=5 to focus forecast on current regime and avoid being pulled by earlier high volatility. Set L to default (promised 0) given consistent evidence. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 so the OR backend sizes base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon using recent demand mean and volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand since the regime shift (noted earlier starting 2019-01-21) remains the operative regime; to focus the forecast on recent weeks I use a recent_N demand estimate. On-hand=15, in-transit=0 so orders should top up to the recent-based base stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show actual lead time consistently 0, so use promised/default L. Recent demand has settled below earlier peak; to keep safety stock responsive to the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat, focusing on the most recent 8 demand observations to capture current weekly demand and volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned with current demand (reducing holding cost) while retaining safety for variability.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods; no recent evidence of lost shipments. Recent weeks' demand (Periods 34-38) are moderate (24-36), and the earlier large regime shift was already recorded. I keep promised lead time (default) so the backend uses truthful lead time. I select default demand and volatility calculations so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/std (scaled by 1+L) which balances service level and holding cost given stable recent demand and current on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=63, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 in all concluded periods (no sustained delays or lost shipments). Recent demand history shows variable weekly demand but no new multi-week regime change since the previously recorded Jan shift. Given stable confirmed lead time and no overdue pipeline, use default estimators so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost under known profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across all observed orders (no evidence of lost/delayed shipments). Recent demand (last ~10 weeks) has been moderate (20\u201335/week) after earlier higher regime; however the overall series is stable and lead time is reliable. Use default lead time to reflect promised 0 and use default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR base-stock anchored to long-run estimates while the backend's cap limits over-ordering, balancing service level (profit-driven q) against holding cost.

Demand history shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 already recorded in carry-over; no new changepoint detected. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given stable lead time and available inventory.

Recent week-on-week demand shows a mild uptick (last 5 demands = 25,29,24,31,62) driven by a single spike but overall recent mean \u224834.2. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 q=4/5=0.8, high service target) I use promised lead time, and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks to capture current trend while keeping responsiveness to the recent spike.

Demand regime shift from early 2019 is already in carry-over history, but recent weeks show continued demand at moderate levels. To balance service vs holding cost I use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples with promised lead time = 0; this leverages full history and the confirmed zero lead time.

Promised lead time historically observed=0. To keep high service (q=0.8) while avoiding excess seasonal holding into December, set L=default to trust promised 0; set mu_hat based on recent_N=8 to reflect current lower demand; set sigma_hat recent_N=8 to capture recent volatility (including the 62 spike).
