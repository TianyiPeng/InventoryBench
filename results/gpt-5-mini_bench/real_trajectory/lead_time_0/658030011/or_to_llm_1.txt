Holding cost is low ($1) vs profit $19 \u2192 high critical fractile (OR already uses q\u22480.95), so err on the side of a slightly higher order to avoid stockouts.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows all recent orders arrived same period (lead_time=0); no in-transit units. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=84. Recent realized demands (P44\u2013P46: 77, 92, 75) average \u224881; three-period recent average used as best predictor given carry-over insights of elevated demand around Periods 30\u201333 earlier and stable 0 lead time. Cost tradeoff: profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 critical fractile q\u22480.95 implies high service target, but with L=0 we need ~1 period of expected demand on-hand \u224881. OR recommended 66 (uses longer-window history and promised L), but current on-hand already exceeds one-period expected demand and adding stock would incur holding cost with little additional sales upside. Final strategy: place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while maintaining service level from existing on-hand inventory.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "No order \u2014 on-hand 84 already exceeds recent one-period demand (~81) with confirmed lead time 0; ordering would raise holding cost with little sales benefit despite OR's 66 recommendation.",
