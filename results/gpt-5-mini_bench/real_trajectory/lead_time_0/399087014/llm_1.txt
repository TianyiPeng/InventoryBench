Recent game history shows strong uptick: Period1 demand=61 (sold 50), Period2 demand=130 (sold 60) with both periods stockouts. Two consecutive periods of being sold out suggests current demand regime may be higher than the Jan baseline but evidence is limited (only 2 periods). Lead time & pipeline: Concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 periods for prior orders; no in-transit inventory and on-hand=0. Inventory implications: With lead_time=0, orders placed now will arrive before demand resolution and can satisfy this period's demand. Cost tradeoff: Profit per unit = $1, holding cost = $1/period \u2014 holding excess inventory is very costly (equal to profit), so prefer to avoid overstock.
