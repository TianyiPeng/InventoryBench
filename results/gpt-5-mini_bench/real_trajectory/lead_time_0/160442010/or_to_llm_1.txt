Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand = 106, in-transit = 0. Recent realized demand (P43\u2013P46) = {24,19,26,25}, recent avg \u2248 23.5 units/week; no sustained spike indicated. Holding cost = $1 = profit, so overstock is costly. OR recommends 51 units based on longer-run history; that would raise ending inventory unnecessarily. Strategy: place no order this period (0 units). With lead time 0, existing on-hand (106) comfortably covers expected demand this period and near-term risk without incurring extra ordering/holding penalty.",
