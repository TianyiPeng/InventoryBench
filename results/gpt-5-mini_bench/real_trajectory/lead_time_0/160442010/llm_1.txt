No concluded arrivals in history to infer lead time; orders may arrive same-period but could also be delayed or lost. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Current period demand will occur after decision, so order should cover current-period demand; given high holding cost (Holding=$1 equals Profit=$1), avoid overstocking. e) Final order logic: Use recent mean (~67) to meet expected demand this period while minimizing holding exposure and risk of lost/delayed shipments.
