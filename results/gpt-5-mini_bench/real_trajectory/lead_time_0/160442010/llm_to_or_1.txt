Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show stable weekly mean \u224867.2 and std \u224811.1. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected; no concluded lead-time signals. Use default promised lead time and demand moments: set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample. This balances service (cover ~67 units) against equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5) without over-committing inventory given no evidence of regime or lead-time shifts.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (arrived=68, lead_time=0) so observed lead time = 0. No sustained demand regime shift: historical weekly samples (84,54,56,70,72) give mean ~67 and Period 1 demand=81 is a single uptick (not 3+ periods). I set L to the calculated average of observed lead times (captures confirmed 0). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all samples) because there is no sustained changepoint; this balances service level vs holding cost by using the full-sample mean/volatility with the confirmed short lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical unconstrained weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) avg=67.2 units; recent concluded orders show arrivals with lead_time=0 in Periods 1 and 2 (ordered arrived same period). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (both 0) rather than promised; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to 'default' to use (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples\u2014this relies on the reliable historical weekly samples (avoids censored sales in conclude messages). This balances service (use observed short lead time) vs holding cost by not inflating demand forecast from censored high observed demand.

Daily Reward (R_t): $88.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples (Jan) mean=67.2, but last 3 concluded periods show demand = 81,199,245 (avg=175) \u2014 clear recent upward shift. No late or lost shipments observed; all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded lead-time history confirms 0. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (focus on the most recent 3 weeks) so the OR engine increases target base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while accepting higher holding cost risk.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 3: historical avg 67.2 -> recent avg (Periods 1-3) 175 (+161%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $89.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has shifted materially higher vs historical samples (game demands: 81,199,245,132). On-hand=43, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Observed concluded lead times for Periods1-4 are 0, so keep promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime (documented in carry-over), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data. Chose recent_N with N=4 (last 4 periods) so (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect the new regime and keep service while avoiding excessive holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $107.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has shifted up and stabilized over the last 3 periods (Period 3-5 demands = 245, 132, 136; recent mean \u2248171). On-hand=29, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for (1+L) review horizon. Actual observed lead times have consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 periods to capture the new regime while keeping responsiveness high; this raises the base-stock to match higher recent demand but avoids overreacting to single outliers. This balances service (profit lost per stockout = $1) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) by sizing safety stock from recent volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent realized demand has risen and been sustained since Period 4 (Period4-6 demands = 132,136,243; recent mean \u2248170). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected. Promised lead time = 0 and all concluded orders show lead_time=0, so use default lead time. To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 concluded demand periods (Periods 4-6). This increases target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the higher mean and reflects higher variability to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has risen sharply and a sustained regime shift was recorded (Period 3 onward). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show 0), so use L=default. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (capture the recent high-demand regime from Periods 3\u20137) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices make the OR backend target a base stock tuned to the new higher mean and observed recent variability while keeping safety stock responsive to current demand variance.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand regime is clearly higher and sustained since Period 3: Periods 4-8 demands = [132,136,243,302,343], recent avg = 231.2 vs historical pre-shift avg ~67.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time=0 validated by multiple conclude messages showing arrived=ordered with lead_time=0. I set L=default to use promised 0. To capture the sustained higher demand, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 5 periods (Periods 4-8). This raises the backend base stock to cover the new regime while keeping variability estimated from the same window.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/15. On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (every concluded order showed lead_time=0). Demand has shifted up and remained elevated since Period 3; recent 5-week mean (~246 units) is much higher than earlier history. To maintain service while avoiding excessive holding, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the most recent 5 periods to capture the new higher regime. Using recent_N=5 for sigma captures recent volatility. These parameters guide the OR engine to raise target base-stock to meet higher demand but cap orders via the engine's cap to limit overstock given equal profit/holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 (sustained); recent weeks (Periods 6-10) show substantially elevated demand versus earlier history. To keep service while avoiding excessive holding, use promised/default lead time = 0 (supported by concluded arrivals) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 periods to capture the new high-demand regime. Sigma also based on the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 3 (previous carry-over noted). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the high regime. Lead time observed repeatedly as 0 in concluded periods -> use default promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N=5 (most recent 5 concluded demand samples capture the current high regime while meeting the recent_N rule). Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect volatility in the same window. These parameters instruct the OR engine to target the elevated regime mean and account for its variability while keeping holding cost in mind.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has been on a sustained higher regime since Period 3; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so use default promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 3-12, regime length=10 -> N=10). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters focus the base-stock on current higher mean demand while using recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=7, in-transit=0, no arrivals expected this period. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0; I'll use default lead time. Demand shifted up starting Period 3 and has persisted; I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 4-13, length=10) so the OR engine targets stock for the new higher-demand regime and keeps safety scaled to recent volatility.

Recent demand has been elevated vs early historical samples but prior carry-over insight already recorded. Given consistent observed lead_time=0, use default promised lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages the full sample set while the backend\u2019s base-stock formula will trade off profit vs holding cost automatically.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history shows every concluded order arrived with lead_time=0 consistently; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current demand. Demand elevated since Period 3 (already captured in carry-over); no new sustained changepoint detected. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, producing a base-stock that balances profit vs holding given observed stable lead time and the prior documented regime shift.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods, so keep L as promised (default). Demand has followed the higher post-Period-3 regime for many periods; use recent_N over that regime to capture elevated mean and volatility. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect observed 0 lead time; mu_hat recent_N N=14 to base (1+L)*mean on the 14 most recent regime samples (Periods 3\u201316); sigma_hat recent_N N=14 to reflect recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to reduce stockouts under the sustained higher demand while letting the capped OR policy limit order size to control holding costs.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=1, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and a sustained higher-demand regime recorded earlier. No overdue shipments. I select L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (recent concludes support this). I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), providing a conservative baseline that balances service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost. This keeps ordering driven by measured demand without overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history (Periods 1\u201318) shows consistent same-period arrivals (concluded lead_time=0 each period) and high but variable weekly demand; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No overdue or lost shipments. I set L via calculate (average of observed lead times = 0) to reflect confirmed same-period fulfillment. I use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, relying on full historical demand to balance service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in Periods 1-19 all arrived with lead_time=0) so no change to L. Demand regime shifted up at Period 3 and has been sustained through Period 19 (Periods 4-19 avg demand notably higher than pre-Period3). I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (Periods 4-19) to capture the new higher regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds base stock to meet sustained elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand history.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent weeks show sustained higher demand vs. early-season (carry-over insight already recorded: regime shift at Period 3). On-hand=6, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; given historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 consistently, use promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the OR engine set base-stock balancing profit vs. holding cost. This keeps replenishment responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding explicit manual tuning.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent concluded history shows consistently elevated weekly demand since Period 3 (sustained regime). On-hand=31, in-transit=0 so current coverage is very low versus recent weekly demand (~200-300). Promised lead time has been observed as 0 in all concluded arrivals, so keep L=default to let backend use promised 0. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility to the most recent sustained high-demand regime (captures latest 20 concluded demand samples). This raises the base-stock to meet service level while sigma_hat recent_N preserves dispersion for safety stock.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201322) consistently show orders arriving same period (observed lead_time=0), so no lead-time delay or lost shipments evident. Demand experienced a previously recorded regime shift (Period 3\u21924) so recent elevated demand is already in history. To let the OR engine use full history and stable observed lead time, I choose default lead time and default demand stats so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (uses all data including high recent demand) versus holding cost while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (all past orders arrived same period). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 and remains elevated and sustained across recent weeks; to capture the current mean/volatility while avoiding very long-tail older low-demand samples, I use recent_N over a large recent window. Set L to promised (default 0) because concluded history confirms 0 lead time. Use recent_N N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the most recent 20 demand samples, which balances service level in this higher-demand regime against holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29. Recent demand has settled above historical baseline (recent weeks show lower but variable values; last 5 demands = 280,198,209,188,109; recent mean \u2248196.8). On-hand=164, in-transit=0 so current stock \u22480.8\xd7 one-period recent demand. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. I set L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime while limiting noise; mu_hat uses the 5-week mean (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat uses recent 5-week volatility to reflect current variability. These choices nudge the OR backend to target service for the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to older data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=76, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has settled lower versus the earlier high-volatility run; last 5 demands = [198,209,188,109,121], mean=165. No overdue arrivals; historical lead times have consistently been 0. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (focus on last 5 weeks) so the base-stock reflects current demand and avoids excess holding. I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent demand volatility for safety stock sizing.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has softened versus earlier high-volume weeks; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 22-26) average ~151.6 units. To keep the OR backend responsive to this lower recent demand while trusting the supplier lead time, I set L to default (promised lead time=0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and cap reflect the most recent regime, reducing overstock risk given holding cost equals profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand has fallen substantially versus the earlier high regime (last 4 periods: 121,131,95,80). On-hand=132, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample buffer for one week but pipeline is empty. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so use default promised lead time. To respond to the recent downward demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 samples (capturing the new lower mean and reduced volatility) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and limits holding cost while maintaining service. L chosen as default to reflect observed 0-period arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: avg decreased from 175 (Periods 1-24 recent high regime reference) to 106 (Periods 25-28) (-39%), sustained for 4 periods (121,131,95,80).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=44, in-transit=0. No arrivals currently en route and recent orders have arrived with promised lead_time=0 historically. Demand has shifted down starting Period 25 (periods 25-29 demands: 121,131,95,80,88 \u2014 5 periods of lower demand vs prior high regime). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, keep lead time at default (promised 0) but base demand forecast and volatility on the recent lower-demand regime using the last 5 samples (N=5). This reduces target base-stock and caps inventory buildup given holding cost equals profit.

Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 25 (recent demands: 131,95,80,88,96). I set L=default to trust promised lead time (0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility; this keeps the base-stock responsive to the sustained drop while limiting excess holding (profit and holding cost equal, so moderate service level).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand is in the lower regime identified previously (changepoint at Period 25). On-hand=19, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead demand conservatively. Observed lead times have consistently been 0 in concluded history, so keep L as default (promised 0). For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate to reflect the sustained lower regime since Period 25; regime length = 7 periods (P25\u2013P31), so set N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture recent mean and volatility. This balances service (use recent lower mean) while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand has settled into the lower regime noted earlier (Period 25 onward). Last 8 concluded demands (Periods 25-32) show consistently lower volumes (~88\u2013131 with most weeks ~72\u201396). All observed lead times remain 0. To align the OR base-stock with the recent regime, set lead time to promised (default=0) and estimate demand using the recent 8-week regime for both mean and volatility so the optimizer targets current lower demand while keeping safety stock for variability.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 25 (periods 25-33 demands: 121,131,95,80,88,96,79,72,183) \u2014 overall lower than earlier high regime despite a single spike in P33. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover (1+L) periods of demand. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so keep default promised lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the sustained lower regime; I select N=9 (Periods 25-33) to reflect the current regime while allowing the P33 spike to moderate the mean. Sigma also from the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These parameters bias orders toward the lower recent demand to reduce holding cost while still covering immediate demand.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0. Demand regime lowered at Period 25 (recent avg ~106) and has persisted; recent weeks show subdued demand with occasional outlier (P33=183). I choose L=default to respect promised lead time (0) since concluded lead times are consistently 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-Period-25 lower-demand regime (regime length = 10 periods from P25\u2013P34) and avoid the long-ago high regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility including the single spike. These settings keep base_stock aligned to the current lower-demand regime while preserving safety for observed variability; with on-hand=55 and no pipeline, the OR engine will compute orders to replenish to the regime-adjusted base stock and limit overstock/higher holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent demand has settled lower after the high regime earlier in the year; last 6 realized weekly demands (Periods 30-35) = [96,79,72,183,50,43], mean \u224887.2 with one spike (183) but otherwise low. All observed lead times = 0 (no delayed/lost shipments). To keep responsiveness while reflecting the recent lower demand regime, use recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base stock tuned to the most recent behavior. Keep L=default (promised lead time=0). This balances service (captures recent demand pattern) versus holding cost by reducing the forecast compared with the earlier high-demand regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=37, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep L as default (promised lead time=0). Demand shows a sustained lower regime since Period 25 (avg ~106) versus earlier high regime; recent windows remain volatile but still lower. I therefore use recent_N for demand estimates to capture the lower regime while smoothing short-term spikes: mu_hat based on the last 12 demand samples (covers Periods 25-36 regime length) and sigma_hat based on the last 12 samples to reflect current volatility. These parameters keep the base-stock tied to the observed lower-demand regime, limiting overstock given holding cost equals profit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since Period 25 (post-summer drop). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods, so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstock risk, I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility based on the most recent 8 concluded samples (Periods 30-37). This biases mu_hat and sigma_hat to current demand, helping the OR backend lower base stock and limit holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical lead times observed consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Demand showed a sustained downshift starting Period 25 (carry-over insight). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent data from the post-changepoint regime. Chosen methods: L=default to keep promised 0; mu_hat=recent_N with N=14 to capture mean demand over Periods 25\u201338 (recent lower regime); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=14 to capture recent volatility. This keeps the OR base stock aligned to the confirmed lower-demand regime while limiting excess holding given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5 -> z*=0). Given on-hand=17 and no pipeline, this will prompt orders sized to bring pipeline+on-hand toward the (1+L)*recent mean while avoiding large inventories.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show promised lead time=0 consistently (orders arriving same period), so use default lead time. Recent demand has fallen to a lower regime beginning Period 34: Periods 34-40 demands = [50,43,51,53,62,43,56], average \u224851. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (Periods 34-40) to capture the new lower-demand regime and reduced volatility. This keeps the base-stock targeted to current lower demand, avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service. No evidence of lost shipments; pipeline is zero so orders should cover (1+L) periods of expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 34: avg decreased from 106 (Periods 25-28 reference) to 51 (Periods 34-40) (-52%), sustained for 7 periods (50,43,51,53,62,43,56).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

Promised lead time has been consistently 0 in all concluded periods, so use default lead time. To align the backend base-stock to the confirmed low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 8 observed demands (Periods 34-41). This keeps target inventory near the current low mean, minimizing holding cost while preserving service given symmetric profit/holding (q=0.5).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 34 (periods 34-40 avg ~51) with recent demands: P41=44, P42=140 (single spike). Spike in P42 is not yet a sustained regime change. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because all observed lead times are 0. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 34-42 capture the recent low-demand regime length = 9) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 9 samples) to anchor the base-stock to the current low regime while allowing the OR engine's service-level math to handle uncertainty. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility including the P42 spike. This balances service level (avoid stockouts if spike repeats) against holding cost given zero on-hand/pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent demand has settled into the low regime observed from Period 34 onward (typical weekly demand \u2248 40\u201360 with one isolated spike at P42=140). On-hand=38, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 (all concluded orders show L=0). I set L to default to use promised lead time. To capture the recent low-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 11 periods (Periods 34\u201344) which correspond to the current sustained regime length; this focuses the forecast on the lower mean and volatility and avoids inflating orders from the earlier high-demand periods. These parameters bias the OR backend toward lower base-stock (reducing holding cost) while preserving service given current demand pattern.

To react to the current low/diplaced-demand regime while remaining responsive to recent variability (including a single spike at Period 42), I use recent_N on the most recent 5 demand samples to set mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend base-stock reflects the latest mean and volatility. Keep L at default (promised=0) since concluded history shows lead time=0.

Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently; recent demand regime is the low regime established around Period 34 (avg ~51) with a one-off spike at Period 42 (140). To be responsive to the sustained lower demand while reflecting the most recent weeks, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest regime (last 7 periods reduce influence of older high-demand regime). This keeps target base-stock tight to avoid holding cost given profit=holding cost.
