Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 547780001 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Use promised lead time (default) since no evidence of delays. Historical weekly sample mean = 74.6; use default mu_hat to set (1+L)*mean = 74.6 units and default sigma_hat using full-sample std = ~26.96 scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (base-stock set from observed demand) vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio and no new signals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand (Period1 sold=69) is consistent with historical weekly samples (121,57,75,63,57); no sustained changepoint detected. Period1 concluded that the order placed in Period1 arrived with lead_time=0, so promised lead time remains plausible but not yet repeatedly confirmed. On-hand=50, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. To keep policy stable, use default lead time and default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)), which balances service level vs. holding cost given moderate demand and low holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/02/25 (Period 3). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show orders placed in Period 1 and Period 2 both arrived same period (lead_time=0). Demand samples (historical dataset) will be used by default methods. No overdue shipments observed. Choose L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual lead time=0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 1; Period 2 order arrived in Period 2).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded periods show steady weekly demand samples (121,57,75,63,57) with mean ~74.6 and confirmed actual lead time = 0. On-hand=59, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service (covers current-period demand after decision) while avoiding excess holding given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

Daily Reward (R_t): $754.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded periods show stable weekly demand (historical samples mean ~74.6) and confirmed actual lead time = 0. Current on-hand=63, in-transit=0. No overdue/lost shipments. Use promised/default lead time (0) and default demand estimates based on all samples to reflect stable regime and provide the OR backend with a full-sample forecast; this balances service (meet ~74.6 expected weekly demand) against low holding cost ($1) by relying on the backend's z* calculation rather than manually inflating safety stock.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has settled below earlier historical outlier (recent five-period demands = 69,52,51,43,48; mean=52.6) while the 2019-01-07 sample (121) appears as an outlier. On-hand=56, in-transit=0 so no incoming cover; lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods. To avoid overstating demand and accumulating holding cost, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent regime (captures recent lower mean and volatility). This reduces target base stock versus using the older high outlier and balances service level against holding cost given current inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $671.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent realized weekly demand has stepped down from earlier highs; last 6 concluded demands = [69,52,51,43,48,37], average = 50 units/week. On-hand=32, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Actual lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods. I set L=default (promised 0) to keep orders arriving same period. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (stable lower demand). sigma_hat left as default to let the backend compute volatility from full sample history scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices keep base-stock aligned with current lower demand, reducing holding while maintaining service given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u20137) shows steady weekly demand with no sustained upward/downward regime shift (demands: 69,52,51,43,48,37,40). All concluded orders arrived same period, so promised lead time 0 has been confirmed historically. On-hand = 48, in-transit = 0; using default lead time keeps OR backend aligned with supplier behavior. I choose default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples to produce a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost given confirmed L=0 and no strong demand regime change.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded history (Periods 1-8) shows stable same-period arrivals (actual lead time = 0 confirmed) and weekly demand samples: [121,57,75,63,57,69,52,51,43,48,37,40,49,49] with on-hand=48, in-transit=0. No sustained demand regime shift detected. Use promised/default lead time to match observed 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting OR backend set base-stock per profit/holding tradeoff while accounting for observed zero lead time and current pipeline=on-hand+in-transit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent weekly demand (Periods 1-9) shows stable moderate sales: [69,52,51,43,48,37,40,49,46], no sustained spike or drop. On-hand=49, in-transit=0 so current coverage is ~1 week. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (no missing shipments), so use promised lead time. I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent 9 demand observations (captures current regime and avoids older Jan samples). This balances service (captures recent mean) vs holding cost by not inflating forecasts with older higher values.

No sustained demand regime shift detected\u2014recent demands (Periods 1\u201310) are stable around prior mean. To keep parameters simple and let OR backend apply full-sample statistics with promised lead time, use default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so base-stock and cap derive from all available samples.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times confirm actual L=0 (Period 1\u201311 arrivals all same-period). Recent weekly demand has declined (last 2 weeks 24,25 vs earlier weeks ~40\u201369). To adapt quickly to the recent lower demand I keep L as promised (default) and use an EWMA for mu_hat to weight recent weeks more heavily (gamma=0.3). For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture recent demand volatility without overfitting. These settings reduce target base-stock relative to longer-term mean and limit holding cost while keeping service given confirmed 0 lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-06. Recent weekly demand (Periods 1\u201312) averages lower than Jan baseline; on-hand=23, in-transit=0 and last order (P12) had 0 arrival because none was placed. Lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). I use L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N over all 12 available recent periods to capture current regime including the spring dip and avoid overweighting sparse Jan samples: mu_hat recent_N N=12, sigma_hat recent_N N=12 to reflect observed volatility over the same window. This balances service level (using recent mean) against holding cost given low on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. Recent observed demand has cooled versus the Jan samples; last 5 periods' demands (P10-P14) average ~32.8 units/week. On-hand=55, in-transit=0 so we are well stocked for current week but should size future orders to current lower-demand regime. Lead time historically observed as 0 every concluded period, so use calculated lead time. Set mu_hat to recent_N (last 5 weeks) to capture the current lower-demand regime and sigma_hat to recent_N (last 5) to reflect recent volatility. This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given ample on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period delivery (lead time = 0) and steady weekly demand (no sustained regime shift). To balance high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) I'll use the backend defaults: promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This treats demand as stable and avoids overfitting recent week-to-week noise while respecting confirmed zero lead time.

Recent weekly demand has varied ~24\u201352 (historical Jan samples: 121,57,75,63,57 are weekly but older); current on-hand=57, in-transit=0 and last concluded arrivals show lead time=0 consistently. No evidence of lost shipments. To balance $19 profit vs $1 holding, use the backend's default demand estimates so OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean and std with promised L=0. This keeps parameters grounded in all available history while the confirmed 0-period lead time ensures same-period arrivals in OR's model.

I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility (backend will compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples). This keeps the OR base-stock anchored to long-run mean while avoiding overreaction to short blips; with high on-hand and zero pipeline this prevents unnecessary ordering and holding cost.

Recent weekly demand has been moderate-to-low (single-digit to low-double-digit in June/July) with no sustained upward shift or volatility spike; no evidence to change demand regime. To keep policy aligned with confirmed lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes base_stock from all historical samples.

Recent weekly demand has been lower in summer: last 5 concluded demands = [30,13,8,13,26], mean ~18. To keep service without excess holding, I use the recent 5-week demand estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat while trusting promised lead time (confirmed=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $1180.00

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=17, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, and recent periods show variable weekly demand (several weeks with demand 40+ and some low weeks). No sustained evidence of lead-time shifts or new demand regime. To let the OR engine apply its calibrated base-stock formula using full-sample statistics, use default lead time and default demand moments so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameters aligned with observed zero lead time and lets the backend balance service level vs. holding cost automatically.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Historical concluded periods show consistent lead_time=0 (confirmed in Period 3) and frequent weekly demand observations including a single large spike in Period 26 (d=124) but no sustained regime shift (recent means fluctuate). Use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level and holding cost given no confirmed multi-period demand change and zero pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a clear upward regime starting Period 25 (Period 25..27 demands = 63,124,212) with stockouts in Periods 26\u201327; no overdue shipments (lead time has been 0 historically). To respond, keep L = promised (0) and use recent data to capture the new higher mean and volatility: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (last three periods) so the OR engine targets a much larger base stock and reflects increased variability. This balances service (reduce lost sales from the spike) against holding cost by basing forecasts on the recent realized spike rather than long-run lower demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 25: avg demand increased from ~40 (prior baseline) to 133 over Periods 25\u201327 (63,124,212) (+~233%), sustained 3 periods

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=106, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 consistently. Demand regime shifted starting Period 25 (Period 25\u201327: 63,124,212; Period 28 demand=151) \u2014 recent demand clearly higher than earlier baseline. To capture the new regime, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the most recent high-demand observations (Periods 26\u201328) so the OR backend raises base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while limiting exposure to older low-demand data.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1923.00

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=129, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (multiple confirmed arrivals same period). Demand jumped starting Period 25 and has been elevated over the last 5 weeks (Periods 25\u201329: 63,124,212,151,108) \u2014 treat this as a new higher-demand regime. Set L to default (promised = 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base the base-stock on the elevated 5-period mean ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture the higher volatility in the recent regime. This increases service during the sustained spike while avoiding under-forecasting; using recent data also avoids diluting the forecast with prior low-demand periods.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 25 (demands: 63,124,212,151,108,112 over Periods 25\u201330). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. On-hand=111, in-transit=0; given the higher recent demand, use recent data to set forecast. Set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) which matches observed. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (Periods 25\u201330) to capture the new higher mean and volatility; N=6 equals the length of the detected regime (>=3). This increases target base-stock to protect service levels during elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures higher variability, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 25 (Periods 25\u201331 have much higher demand vs pre-25). Current on-hand=140, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To target the new higher demand regime and limit holding cost, set L to default (promised 0). For demand and volatility use recent_N with N=7 (regime from Period 25\u201331 length=7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the post-change mean and variance. This balances service (capture higher average demand) against holding cost by basing base-stock on the new regime rather than long-run diluted averages.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=146, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (Periods 1\u201332). Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting at Period 25 (Period 25\u201327: 63,124,212) and the elevated demand persisted through Periods 25\u201332. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded history confirms 0. For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (N=8, Periods 25\u201332) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher demand level and volatility; this keeps base-stock aligned to current demand while avoiding dilution by older low-demand data, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=113, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this decision. To reflect the new higher-demand regime I use recent data for demand moments while keeping lead time as the promised/default (0). Methods: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 to capture the 9 periods since the regime shift (Periods 25\u201333); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=9 to capture the recent increased volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward the higher recent mean to avoid stockouts during the sustained higher-demand regime while using recent volatility to control safety stock and holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Product: basic sweatpants; recent demand regime increased starting Period 25 (periods 25\u201337 show elevated demand). On-hand=95, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments and historical concludes confirm lead time = 0. I keep L as default (promised 0) since concluded history uniformly supports 0. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=13 (periods 25\u201337) so the base-stock reflects the post-shift mean over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=13 to capture current volatility. These choices raise the order target to meet the sustained higher demand while the 0 promised lead time keeps arrival timing aggressive; using recent samples prevents diluting the elevated mean with older low-demand periods and balances service level versus holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=104, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0; recent demand rose starting Period 25 and has remained elevated. To capture post-change demand I use recent_N over the most recent 14 periods (Periods 25\u201338) for both mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new regime while keeping L at promised/default (0). This balances higher service needs after the demand shift against holding cost.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 25 (periods 25\u201327 and thereafter higher demand). To keep safety appropriate for the higher recent demand while avoiding excessive holding cost, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand and volatility using the recent regime: regime length since Period 25 = 15 periods, so choose N=15 to capture the new higher mean/variance for (1+L)-period demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=103, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 25 (higher mean since then). Use promised lead time (0) as confirmed historically. Forecast demand using recent_N (most recent regime) to capture elevated mean and recent variability: choose N=10 (uses last 10 demand observations to balance recency and sample size). This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher post-change demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility, helping the OR backend set an appropriate safety stock versus holding cost tradeoff.

Promised lead time = 0 and historically confirmed as 0 \u2014 use default lead time to match supplier performance. For demand forecasting I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean/volatility: regime length since Period 25 is 17 periods, so set N=17. This raises base_stock to reflect the sustained higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures increased variability, helping the OR backend balance service level (reduce stockouts) against holding cost.

To reflect the post-shift demand pattern I use recent data window covering the most recent 9 demand observations (Periods 34\u201342) for demand mean and volatility, and keep lead time as promised (default=0). This keeps orders responsive to the newer higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand history and limits holding cost by using a recent volatility estimate.

Recent demand (last 8 concluded weeks: P36\u2013P43) = [62,80,67,66,61,74,91,51], mean\u224869; use recent_N=8 to reflect current seasonal level after the mid-year regime shift. Sigma estimated from same recent window (recent_N=8) to capture current volatility. These parameters keep base_stock tuned to the higher post-shift demand while avoiding excess stock given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Recent history shows a sustained, higher-demand regime beginning Period 25 (Periods 25\u201344 inclusive ~20 periods) \u2014 weekly demands since the shift remain well above the pre-shift baseline. On-hand=25, in-transit=0 so available coverage is low vs. elevated demand; no outstanding arrivals to rely on. Promised lead time = 0 and historically observed lead time has been 0 (confirmed earlier), so use default lead time. To capture the post-shift demand level and volatility, use recent_N over the full new regime length (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock matching the higher demand while limiting excess inventory from older low-demand periods. This balances higher service (avoid stockouts under the new regime) against holding cost by using only the recent elevated-demand samples.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201345 arrivals match same-period orders). A sustained demand regime shift was confirmed at Period 25 (higher mean from Periods 25\u201327 and persisted). To capture the new higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 periods (covers the post-shift regime and balances responsiveness vs. noise). This increases service level for the higher demand while the low holding cost ($1) tolerates higher stocks to avoid lost sales.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (many periods). Demand has been elevated since the regime shift detected at Period 25; recent weeks (Periods 42\u201346 demands = 91,51,65,118,153) include strong Dec/holiday volatility. To capture the most recent demand level and volatility while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with concluded history, I use promised/default lead time and recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the latest 5-week demand pattern and avoids overstating older lower-demand periods.
