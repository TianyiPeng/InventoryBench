Demand outlook: recent weeks show elevated demand (Periods 42\u201345 demands = 91, 51, 65, 118) and current date is 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas), which typically increases demand for warm casual clothing like sweatpants. OR recommended 125 using long-run historical stats; given current holiday timing, recent spike (118) and high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), we should bias upward to avoid missed sales.

Demand analysis: recent weeks show a December demand spike\u2014Period 43\u201346 demands = 51, 65, 118, 153; recent trend is sharply upward with last-period demand = 153. OR baseline (130) is computed from historical series and promised L, but it underestimates the current elevated demand and trend. Cost tradeoff: profit $19 vs holding $1 implies a high service-level (critical fractile \u22480.95, large safety stock justified). With lead time 0, orders placed now will arrive during this period and can meet demand occurring after the decision. Strategy: prioritize avoiding stockouts during the current high-demand regime. I increase OR's capped recommendation of 130 up to 153 units to match last-period realized demand (minimizes expected lost sales while holding cost is low).
