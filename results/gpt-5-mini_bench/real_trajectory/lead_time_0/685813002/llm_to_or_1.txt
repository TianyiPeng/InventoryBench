Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) mean = 50.6 units, sample std \u2248 10.67. Promised lead time = 0; with no evidence of delays or regime change, use default lead time and default demand stats so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This ensures ordering targets one-period demand while keeping safety stock aligned to observed variability.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent concluded history: Period 1 order of 69 arrived within Period 1 (observed lead_time=0) and demand in Period 1 was 54, leaving on-hand=15 and in-transit=0. Historical weekly mean demand (samples provided) \u224850.6. No sustained changepoint detected (only one recent period). Use promised lead time (default L=0) because observed arrival confirms same-period lead time and there is insufficient evidence of delays. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level (covers ~one-period demand) against holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded history shows two same-period arrivals (Period1 and Period2) with observed lead_time=0 each, on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 now. No overdue or missing shipments visible. I set L by 'calculate' (average of observed lead times -> confirms 0). Demand history (five samples mean=50.6) and L=0 imply using default mu_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples. Use default sigma_hat so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This keeps target base_stock near historical mean demand (balancing high profit $19 vs low holding $1) to avoid excess holding while maintaining service level.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1068.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P3) shows orders arriving same period; demand in P1\u2013P3 = 54,68,57 (recent mean ~59.7) above older sample mean (50.6). Lead time appears reliably 0. To reflect the recent higher run-rate while keeping volatility anchored to longer history, set L by calculating observed lead times, use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the upshift, and keep sigma_hat default to avoid overfitting short-sample variance. This balances service (higher mu_hat) vs holding cost (use recent N minimal).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3)

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P4) shows orders arriving same period (lead time 0) and on-hand=41, in-transit=0. No evidence of lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default L=0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. Demand history (five weekly samples: 64,36,45,52,56) yields baseline mean ~50.6; use default mu_hat to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean from all samples. Use default sigma_hat so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. These conservative defaults leverage confirmed 0 lead time and full sample history to balance service level (profit $19) against low holding cost ($1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history (Periods 1-5) shows all orders arrived same period -> actual lead time = 0 confirmed. On-hand=34, in-transit=0; recent demand samples (periods 1-5 plus earlier samples) indicate stable weekly demand without a sustained regime shift. Use default lead time to keep promised 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects full historical demand while the confirmed lead time=0 allows same-period replenishment and avoids over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=42, in-transit=0. Recent demand has softened (last 3 concluded demands: 36,37,28) versus earlier higher weeks; lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior periods. I choose L=default to use promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent lower regime (N=3 is minimum and matches a 3-period recent regime). Sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent observed weekly demand has fallen from early-Feb highs to ~mid-30s in the last 5 periods (periods 3-7 demands = 57,36,37,28,35 \u2192 mean 38.6). On-hand=7, in-transit=0 so current coverage is very low relative to recent weekly demand. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 0 (concluded P1\u2013P6). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the clear downward regime in the last five weeks, reducing overstating replenishment. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than older higher-variance samples. These choices reduce over-ordering while keeping service for the current lower-demand regime; backend will convert these into base-stock and order caps.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent weekly demand has been variable but centered around mid-30s\u201350s (recent demands: 54,68,57,36,37,28,35,55). On-hand=2, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 (sustained evidence P1\u2013P6 arrivals). I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples\u2014this balances service level (profit $19) against low holding cost ($1) without overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand (Periods 1-9) averages ~44.9 units/week with moderate variability; on-hand=35, in-transit=0 and no overdue shipments. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I select L=default to keep promised 0. I use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bias the forecast to the latest 9 observed demands (captures recent downward shift from earlier 50s to ~45) so the OR engine sets base-stock to meet (1+L) period demand while limiting holding cost exposure given current on-hand of 35.

Demand history shows moderate, variable weekly demand; holding cost is low ($1) vs profit $19, so favor service. Use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand/volatility estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples) to let the OR engine set base-stock and cap using full history.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Historical weekly demand (P1\u2013P11) averages ~42.5 units/week (std ~13.9). On-hand=29, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is below one-week average but shipments have consistently arrived same-period. Carrying the confirmed lead-time=0 forward, I use default lead time and demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (using full-sample mean) with holding cost conservatism given modest variance and confirmed reliable same-period deliveries.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (Period 1-12 all showed arrived same period). Recent demand (Periods 8-12 = 55,34,24,39,35) shows mean ~37.4 and moderate variability. Given same-period replenishment and profit=$19 vs holding=$1, I prioritize service with a demand forecast based on the most recent 5 periods to capture current regime. Therefore: L=default (use promised 0); mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)*recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and set safety stock appropriately.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0) and weekly demand averaging ~50.6 units from provided samples; current on-hand=32, in-transit=0. No sustained change in mean/variance or lead time since prior confirmation. Use default lead time (promised 0) so the OR engine treats review+lead=(1) week. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances service level (using profit/holding tradeoff) against holding cost given no new regime detected.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201314) shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and stable weekly demand around ~50 units (historical sample mean 50.6). Current inventory: on-hand=41, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples \u2014 this leverages full-sample stability and keeps the base-stock target close to observed demand while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise, balancing service level (profit=$19) against holding cost ($1).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=45, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (consistent through Periods 1\u201315). Recent demand has moderated (last 5 demands: 39,35,24,25,20). To reflect the most recent regime while keeping responsiveness, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 periods, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This balances service (using recent lower mean) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=25, in-transit=0, recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed). Use promised/default lead time. Historical sample mean = 50.6 (samples: 64,36,45,52,56); with L=0 default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 50.6, and sigma_hat default uses std of samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). Default methods keep the OR backend's base-stock calculation aligned with long-run demand while avoiding overreaction to short fluctuations; given no in-transit stock and medium on-hand, this balances service vs holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 and demand appears stable without sustained regime shifts (recent weekly demand mostly 20\u201355).

On-hand=40, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (0), mu_hat=default to rely on full-history mean ((1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 50.6) given no sustained demand regime change, and sigma_hat=default to use full-history volatility. These settings match confirmed lead time, provide the OR backend with the historical mean/variance to balance service level (profit $19 > holding $1 encourages reasonable safety stock) versus holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent on-hand=46, in-transit=0. Historical early-sample mean (given) =50.6/week, but demand has dropped and remained low since Period 19 (demands: 9,10,11,17,17,11,16). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior conclude messages. I set L to default (promised 0). To capture the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (the 7 most recent demand periods, regime length=7) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean based on the depressed recent mean (~13/week) and reduces safety stock accordingly. This avoids excessive holdings while preserving service given the new low-demand regime and confirmed zero lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: recent avg (Periods 19-25) = 13.0 vs earlier full-sample mean = 50.6 (\u221274%).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime beginning Period 19: weekly sales average 13 (P19-25) vs full-sample mean ~50.6. On-hand=31, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock relative to depressed demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods, so use default promised L=0. To capture the post-changepoint demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N over the 7-week regime (Periods 19\u201325; regime_length=7) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of those samples. For volatility, use recent_N with the same N=7 to reflect reduced variance. These choices reduce ordering to match the lower demand and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given current on-hand inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=13, in-transit=0. Historical data and conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (consistent across many periods). Demand experienced a sustained downshift starting Period 19: recent avg (P19-25)=13.0 vs full-sample mean=50.6 (\u221274%). I set L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (the detected low-demand regime length, Periods 19\u201325) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the most relevant reduced-demand regime, avoiding overstock from legacy higher-demand periods.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (orders arriving same period). Demand regime shift detected starting Period 19: recent avg (P19-25)=13 vs earlier mean ~50; recent regime length=7. To reflect the low-demand regime and keep safety stock high given q=0.95, set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (use last 7 demand samples to capture current mean and variability). This reduces forecast to current regime and keeps OR backend providing appropriate base-stock while avoiding excess inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Demand has clearly shifted down starting Period 19 (recent avg Periods 19\u201325 = 13.0 vs full-sample mean \u224850.6). On-hand=20, in-transit=0; lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised (0) since concluded arrivals confirm same-period lead time. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=11 (Periods 19\u201329) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the low-demand regime, reducing order targets and holding cost exposure while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding given high profit ($19) but much lower demand.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (Periods 1\u201330 confirms). Recent demand (Periods 24\u201330 = 11,16,15,18,31,9,59) shows elevated volatility with a large spike in Period 30 and recent stockouts; no sustained new regime (needs 3+ consistent periods) beyond the earlier low-demand regime already recorded. To be responsive to recent volatility and the Period 30 spike, keep promised lead time (default) and use recent demand statistics over the last 7 periods to forecast the (1+L)-period demand and volatility so orders react quickly to the recent mix of low and spike demand. This balances service (capture spikes) against holding cost by focusing on recent evidence rather than the long-run mean that contains older high-season data.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) future demand. Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0 and a prior demand regime shift (Periods 19-25 avg=13 vs earlier mean=50.6). However recent Periods 28-31 show renewed volatility and two large demands (P30=59, P31=85) causing stockouts; this suggests short-term demand uptick/variance. I therefore keep L as default (promised 0, confirmed historically) but use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the backend weight the last 7 weeks' mean and std (captures recent uptick and higher variability) so base-stock and cap increase to reduce stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 19 (avg ~13 vs earlier ~50). On-hand=9, in-transit=0; lead time historically confirmed as 0 (Periods 1-4 arrivals). To reflect the persistent lower-demand regime, use default lead time (promised 0) and recent_N demand estimates over the detected regime. I select recent_N with N=14 (Periods 19\u201332) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability based on the new low-demand regime, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has jumped starting Period 30 (2019/9/2) with four high weeks (Periods 30-33: 59,85,71,116). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N based on the new high-demand regime: N=4 (Periods 30-33) to capture the current elevated mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters shift the base-stock up to meet the current surge while keeping holding cost considered (profit/holding favors service here).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg (Periods 30-33 = 82.75) vs prior recent avg (Periods 19-25 = 13.0) (+536%), sustained 4 periods (2019-09-02 to 2019-09-23).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has shifted up sharply starting Period 30 (demands P30-34 = 59,85,71,116,95; recent mean \u224885.2). On-hand=29, in-transit=0; lead time historically confirmed as 0 (sustained). To respond to the new high-demand regime while keeping holding costs low, I keep L=default (promised 0, consistent with observed arrivals) and use recent_N for demand estimates to focus the forecast on the elevated regime (N=5 captures P30-34). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet the higher service-level implied by profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand data.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been reliably 0 (confirmed earlier). To capture the sustained higher demand, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet elevated weekly demand while keeping holding cost in mind since on-hand is already 53 and in-transit=0.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Lead time historically confirmed as 0 (sustained arrivals same period). Demand underwent a low regime around Periods 19-25 and shifted up starting Period 30; recent periods (P30\u2013P37) show substantially higher demand (samples: 59,85,71,116,95,69,43,87). I set L=default to keep promised lead time=0 (matches observed concludes). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the post-Period-30 higher-demand regime (regime length=8), so the OR backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the last 8 samples, balancing higher service needs while avoiding excess holding given current on-hand=30 and no in-transit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (orders arriving same period). Recent demand regime (spike starting Period 30) is sustained through Period 38 (high weekly demand vs earlier low regime). On-hand=28, in-transit=0 \u2014 modest stock vs elevated recent demand; use a forecast focused on the recent high-demand regime. Set L=default to trust promised 0-day lead time. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=9 (Periods 30\u201338 cover the spike regime) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant recent samples, which raises base-stock to protect service while sigma_hat captures recent volatility and keeps cap reasonable.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Confirmed historical lead time = 0 (multiple concluded arrivals). Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 30 (higher demand since 2019-09-02). I use default lead time to respect confirmed 0. For demand I focus on the recent high-demand regime: set mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 (Periods 30-39) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects current elevated demand. Volatility is set with recent_N N=10 to capture current variability. These parameters steer the OR backend to raise target base stock for higher service while reflecting recent variance to limit overstock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1347.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand shifted up starting Period 30 (Periods 30-40 average high demand; regime length = 11 periods). On-hand=40, in-transit=0; lead time historically confirmed 0. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to focus the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 30-40). I also set sigma_hat recent_N with N=11 to capture volatility in the same recent window. This keeps orders responsive to the new higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand data; with L=0 the backend will compute base_stock for immediate replenishment needs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed in concluded history). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 30 (higher demand since Periods 30-41). To reflect the post-changepoint regime I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 30-41) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the recent high-demand regime. This balances service (capture higher recent mean) against holding cost given current on-hand stock and zero pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 30 (many weeks of elevated sales including a very large spike demand=212 in P42). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus pipeline. Lead time historically confirmed 0; use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast, use recent_N with N=13 (regime length from P30\u2013P42 = 13) so mu_hat reflects the high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=13 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These settings prioritize service during the sustained high-demand regime while keeping holding cost considered via the backend cap.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. No overdue shipments visible. Historical concluded data show a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 30 (elevated weekly demand since 2019-09-02), so I base demand parameters on the post-shift regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded messages, so use default promised lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N to focus the forecast on the most recent high-demand regime; I set N to the length of the recent regime (Periods 30\u201343 = 14 weeks) to capture current mean and volatility. This increases targeted replenishment for higher recent demand while the OR backend will cap orders to limit over-ordering and holding costs; using recent samples reduces risk of understock given the demonstrated regime shift.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 30 (large increases and multiple weeks of doubled/quadrupled demand, plus Black Friday spike in Period 42). Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To capture the current high-demand regime and seasonal uplift, I use recent_N based estimates over the most recent 15 weeks (covers Periods 31-45) for mean and volatility so the OR backend targets a higher base stock while still respecting holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=40, in-transit=0. Lead time historically and repeatedly observed = 0, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has been elevated (notably a large spike in Period 42 and higher weekly demand through Periods 43\u201345). To capture the recent higher demand regime I use recent_N=8 (covers the last 8 weeks, balancing responsiveness and sample size). I set L to default (promised 0). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=8 so the OR backend targets a base-stock reflecting the recent higher mean and volatility, improving service during this holiday/high-demand window while letting the backend cap limit excessive orders.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=134, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 periods consistently. Demand regime since Period 30 shows substantially higher and volatile weekly demand (examples: P30-P46 include many large spikes; recent demands P40-46 = [73,72,212,72,105,112,46], recent mean \u2248 99). To capture the ongoing high/volatile holiday/seasonal demand while keeping orders responsive given L=0, I use recent_N for demand parameters with N=7 (most recent weeks) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This favors service (higher base-stock) through the holiday surge while L=default preserves confirmed lead-time=0 for the OR backend.
