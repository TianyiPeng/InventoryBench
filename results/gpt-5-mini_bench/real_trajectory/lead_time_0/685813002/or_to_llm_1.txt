Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (multiple periods with orders arriving same period). Inventory & demand: on-hand=66, in-transit=0. Recent demands volatile due to holiday spike (Periods 42\u201345: 212,72,105,112) but most post-spike weeks (P46=46) and pre-spike baseline (~40\u201390) imply current on-hand is sufficient for near-term demand when lead time=0. OR recommended 45 units based on promised lead time and historical mean; with immediate arrivals possible and a non-negligible holding cost ($1/unit) I avoid overstocking after recent large receipts (Periods 43 and 45). Action: place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost while preserving ability to order next period if demand persists or spikes again (zero lead time allows quick replenishment).",
