{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 (Period 1\u201346 arrivals all same-period). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so any order will arrive during this period and can satisfy Period 47 demand. Demand analysis: recent realized demand is elevated (P46 demand=135, P45 demand constrained by stockout at 117 demanded; several prior peaks in Q4), so downside risk of understocking is high. OR baseline: recommends 117 units (uses promised L=0, historical demand). Given confirmed L=0, no lost shipments, and strong recent demand signal, I accept the OR capped base-stock recommendation. Ordering 117 balances avoiding large stockouts (profit $4/unit) against holding cost $1/unit. Therefore order 117 units.",
