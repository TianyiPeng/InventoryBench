Product: women's Brazilian briefs \u2014 a typical gift/seasonal uplift candidate. Demand analysis: recent weekly history (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) average = 122 units/week (samples: 114,133,148,86,129). No clear upward regime shift in the 5-sample history. Lead-time and pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, supplier promised LT=0; no concluded arrivals to contradict promise. Given promised LT=0 we must cover current period demand (L+1=1 periods). Inventory decision: profit $4/unit >> holding $1/unit/period so prioritize service (sell-through) while avoiding large excess inventory. Allow small buffer for a likely Valentine uplift and sample variability (~15%).
