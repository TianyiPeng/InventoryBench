Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Recent weekly demand shows a sustained uptick (101,101,117,123,157). Use promised lead time (default) since no lead-time evidence. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the recent increase in mean demand across the (1+L) review+lead period. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to meet higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: avg increased from 101 (weeks 2019-01-07\u20142019-01-14) to 132.3 (weeks 2019-01-21\u20142019-02-04) (+31%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent data show a demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (post-change sample mean \u2248132.3). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and prior order in P1 arrived with observed lead_time=0. I set L by averaging observed lead times to let backend confirm promised 0 with history. For demand I use recent_N=3 (the 3-week post-changepoint regime: 117,123,157) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 3). Sigma_hat uses recent_N=3 to capture post-shift volatility. These choices focus inventory on the higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in check given limited pipeline and confirmed short lead time.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 arrived with observed lead_time=0 (two confirmations). Historical demand samples show a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (weeks 2019-01-21\u20142019-02-04 mean=132.3, +31% vs prior). To respect confirmed lead time and recent higher demand, set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent regime (last 3 samples) so (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility reflect the new higher-demand level and limit stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Concluded history shows all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 (Periods 1\u20133 concluded: arrived with lead_time 0). Recent demand has shifted up (historical samples + recent periods show higher weekly demand: recent sold = 150,177,164). On-hand=10, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the elevated recent regime. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 0). For demand forecast and volatility I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (gives more weight to latest weeks while keeping a small sample for stability). These parameters bias the OR engine toward a higher base_stock to reduce stockouts while the holding cost is moderate ($1) relative to profit ($4).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P4) show consistently higher demand (150,177,164,161) versus the older samples; actual observed lead times in concludes are 0. I set L to calculate (average observed lead times = 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new higher regime (uses P1\u2013P4 concluded demand) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 4). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep target base-stock responsive to the confirmed higher demand while L=0 avoids extra pipeline buffer and limits holding cost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P5) show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0) and stable elevated demand vs older samples. On-hand=21, in-transit=0; recent demands: 150,177,164,161,152. I set L to use calculated observed lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current higher regime (uses the last 5 observed demands) and for sigma use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps base_stock and cap responsive to the newer higher-demand regime while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand samples; no evidence of lost shipments to adjust L further.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1\u20136) = [150,177,164,161,152,148], mean=158.67. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. On-hand=22, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty vs. weekly demand ~159. I set L via calculate to confirm observed 0-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime detected earlier (post-2019-01-21) and current volatility from the most recent 6 weeks; this biases the base-stock and cap toward meeting ~159 units/week while limiting inventory given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 across multiple periods) so keep L as promised (default). Demand shows a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (carry-over insight) plus a large one-week spike in Period 7 (366) \u2014 to protect service level while damping single-week noise, I use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) so recent higher demand receives weight but extreme spike is smoothed. For sigma_hat I use recent_N=5 to capture current volatility including the large recent spike while limiting influence of older low-variance weeks. This balances profit-driven service level versus holding cost under observed same-period fulfillment.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently (Periods 1\u20138), so I set L to the calculated average (0). Recent demand has a large spike in Period 7 and elevated Period 8, but this is only 2 periods and not yet a sustained regime change; therefore I bias forecasts toward the most recent 3 weeks to be responsive while avoiding overcommitment. With L=0, use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory to cover current elevated demand without assuming a permanent shift.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent demand has risen: last 3 periods (P7\u2013P9) show sustained higher demand. On-hand=183, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Set L to "default" since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the newest regime while smoothing one-off noise; with L=0 this yields (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility including the large spike in P7. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma scaling helps the OR engine size safety stock against volatility, balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg increased from 158.7 (Periods 1\u20136) to 253.7 (Periods 7\u20139) (+60%).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): recent demand history shows a spike in Period 7 (366) then moderating demand (Periods 8\u201310 = 235,160,148). On-hand=143, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and concluded history shows all observed lead_times = 0. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual L=0. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current moderated regime (mean of last 3 demands \u2248 181) with (1+L) multiplier; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility rather than the older high-spike that would inflate variance. These parameters prioritize matching inventory to the near-term demand regime to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service during the recent stabilized demand.

Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=69, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every order arrived same period (observed lead_time=0 across concluded history). Recent demand (Periods 9\u201311 = 160,148,152) is stable around ~153 after the earlier spike. To prioritize matching near-term demand while avoiding excess holding, set L by averaging observed lead times and set demand forecast/volatility using the most recent 3 weeks.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default promised L. Recent demand since the major regime shift at Period 7 (Periods 7\u201312) averages around the post-shift regime; I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 7\u201312) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock tuned to the new regime while avoiding stale pre-shift data and addresses missing pipeline (none) by sizing to recent demand.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=133, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 0 (all concluded orders arrived same period). Recent demand history exhibits a higher regime since Period 7 (large spike followed by elevated weekly demand), but this is already recorded in carry-over. To let the OR engine use observed lead times while leveraging full-sample demand statistics, set L by calculate (average observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level uplift from higher recent demand while avoiding overfitting to one-off spikes. This also keeps pipeline targets aligned given on-hand=133 and no in-transit units.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 in all concluded messages), and on-hand=101, in-transit=0. Demand regime shifts were previously recorded; recent periods (P7\u2013P14) exhibit elevated weekly demand but no new sustained changepoint since last insights. Given stable observed lead time=0, use default lead time so backend trusts promised L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging full history while the backend's capped policy limits order size against variability. This balances service (capture elevated recent demand via sample history) and holding cost control.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201315) shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 for all concluded orders) and no missing shipments; on-hand=113, in-transit=0. Demand has experienced earlier regime shifts (recorded previously) but recent weekly demand (Periods 11\u201315: 152,157,143,111,96) is lower than the earlier spike. I therefore use the promised lead time (default, 0) and let the OR backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from historical samples (default methods). This keeps parameters aligned with observed zero lead time and leverages full-sample statistics while avoiding overfitting short recent volatility.

Use promised lead time (default L=0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new lower-demand regime (regime length=4), reducing target base-stock and volatility to avoid excess holding costs while preserving service.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently (orders always arrived same period), so use promised lead time (default). Recent demand has stepped down: Periods 13\u201317 demands = [143,111,96,64,59], indicating a lower recent regime; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat to capture current lower mean over the (1+L) review+lead horizon. Volatility has also compressed recently, so use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reduce safety stock relative to long-run variability. No evidence of lost shipments to adjust L.

On-hand=61, in-transit=0 \u2014 adequate buffer for a short lead-time product but watch downward demand. I set L to default (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=9 (Periods 11\u201319) to capture the new lower demand regime and reduce order quantities/variability input to the OR backend, improving holding-cost tradeoff while maintaining service.

Recent demand has declined since the spring spike (Periods 13\u201321: 143,111,96,64,59,55,57,33,24) indicating a lower recent regime. I keep L as default (promised 0) since observed lead time consistently =0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (the 9 most recent demand observations, Periods 13\u201321) to capture the current lower-demand regime and reduced variability; this reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1).

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Recent demand has fallen sharply and remained low since Period 17 (demands P17\u2013P22 = 59,55,57,33,24,41; mean \u224844.8). On-hand=63, in-transit=0 so current stock ~1.4 weeks of recent demand. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, no overdue shipments. I set L=default to use promised lead time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 (periods 17\u201322) to capture the new low-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sizes base-stock and safety stock for the lower, sustained demand and avoids excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg dropped from 161.5 (Periods 1\u201316) to 44.8 (Periods 17\u201322), a \u221272% decline, sustained for 6 periods.

LLM Rationale:

Historical data show a sustained demand drop beginning Period 17 (recorded carry-over insight), but no new 3+ period regime since Period 23 to justify changing forecasts. All observed lead times have been 0; use default promised lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost with current statistics.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=140, in-transit=0. Recent history shows the sustained low-demand regime that began at Period 17 (already recorded), no new lead-time evidence (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To avoid overfitting to short noise and let the OR engine apply its base-stock calculation with promised lead time, I keep L as default and use default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps service-level sizing while penalizing excess holding cost given current on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 21\u201325) averaged ~43.6 units/week after the large mid-year shock and a partial recovery; no evidence shipments are delayed (all concluded lead_times=0 historically). To avoid excess holding while matching the recent lower demand regime, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the last 5 weeks and capture current lower mean and volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned with current demand and limits holding cost given substantial on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. Recent demand (Periods 24\u201326) has been low and stable (~45,45,54) after the large-seasonal swings earlier; to reflect the most recent regime and limit excess holding cost I set L=default (promised=0) and use recent_N=3 for demand mean/volatility to focus the forecast on the last 3 weeks. This tightens the base-stock to current observed demand and balances service vs holding cost given current on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has been steady ~45\u201363 after the large regime swings earlier; no new sustained changepoint detected. On-hand=30, in-transit=0 so we should forecast using the recent short-run mean. Promised lead time historically observed as 0 (no evidence of lead-time drift). I set L to default (promised). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (weeks P23\u2013P27: demand 63,45,45,54,53; mean=52) so the OR backend targets (1+L)*recent mean and recent volatility to balance service vs holding cost given current low pipeline and modest demand variability.

On-hand=22, in-transit=0; promised lead time is 0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 so use default L. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the last 5 weeks' mean and volatility) so the OR backend sizes base_stock to current low demand while limiting holding cost.

Recent concluded weekly demand (Periods 24\u201329): 45,45,54,53,37,35 \u2014 recent mean \u2248 44.8, lower than earlier peaks; lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history. To avoid overstocking while maintaining service, keep L at promised (default) and base demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 weeks to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime. Using recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat biases orders toward current lower demand and reduces holding cost exposure.

On-hand=19, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I choose L=default to trust the promised (and observed) 0-period lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current low-demand regime (balances service vs holding cost by sizing orders to recent realized demand and recent volatility).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover upcoming demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use default promised L=0. Demand dropped sharply starting Period 17 and has stayed lower; recent weeks (Periods 24\u201331) average ~45 units/week. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and prioritize avoiding excess holding cost while meeting near-term demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (Periods 24\u201331). This gives the OR backend a forecast focused on the current regime while keeping lead-time at the promised value.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all show 0 so use default promised L=0. Recent demand has trended up in the last 2 weeks (61,101) but this is not yet a sustained (3+ period) regime shift; use a short recent_N window to capture the uptick without overreacting. Therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 demand samples (Periods 28\u201332 = 37,35,33,61,101) to reflect current higher variability and central tendency while keeping lead time at promised 0. This balances service (responding to recent rise) against holding cost by focusing on a small recent sample rather than the long-run mean.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 31\u201334 = 61,101,254,175) shows a sustained uplift vs prior Periods 1\u201330 mean (~107 \u2192 recent mean ~147.8, +38%). Historical lead times have consistently concluded as 0. To respond to the recent regime shift while keeping the backend's base-stock formula responsive, I set L to default (promised = 0) and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 (the 4-period new regime) so the OR engine targets the (1+L)-period demand using the most recent regime statistics.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 31: avg increased from 107.3 (Periods 1\u201330) to 147.8 (Periods 31\u201334), +38%, sustained 4 periods.

Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Recent demand has entered a higher regime starting Period 31 (sustained elevated weekly demand over Periods 31\u201335). Promised lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history (many arrived=... lead_time was 0), so I keep L as default. To capture the recent higher mean and elevated volatility I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 concluded weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock sized to the new regime while reflecting recent variability. This balances higher service level to avoid stockouts during the elevated-demand regime against holding cost given current on-hand (61) and zero pipeline: the recent_N choice increases forecasted \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 relative to full-history averages, prompting larger replenishment but constrained by the OR cap.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=89, in-transit=0. Recent demand has risen since the regime shift at Period 31; last 5 demands (Periods 32\u201336) = [101,254,175,159,124], capturing current high-variance regime. Use promised lead time (default L=0) since concluded history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to target (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility and keep service high while limiting holding cost given current inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=113, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 31\u201337) shows elevated regime after Period 31: demands = [61,101,254,175,159,124,100], mean \u2248139.1. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show 0 lead time. I set L=default to use the promised 0. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covering the seven most recent periods since the changepoint at Period 31). This biases the base-stock toward the higher short-term mean while sigma_hat recent_N captures the recent volatility; together they balance service level (use higher mu_hat) against holding cost given holding is significant relative to profit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Recent history (Periods 31\u201338) shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning at Period 31 (elevated weekly sales: 61,101,254,175,159,124,100,187) \u2014 I treat this as the active regime. No evidence of lead-time change (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). To capture the elevated mean and recent volatility while keeping responsiveness, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the last 8 weeks (the identified regime). This increases target base-stock to improve service during the sustained high-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N inflates safety stock to limit stockouts without excessive holding since holding cost is moderate ($1/unit).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=88, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (all concluded orders list lead_time 0), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has experienced prior regime shifts (recorded in carry-over) but recent periods (P36\u2013P39) show no new sustained change. Use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 q=0.8) while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise given no new sustained signal and no in-transit coverage.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Recent demand (Periods 36\u201340) shows elevated/variable weekly demand (124,100,187,109,132) \u2014 I'll focus the forecast on this recent regime. Use promised lead time (default) and set mu_hat/sigma_hat from the most recent 5 periods to capture the current mean and volatility so the OR engine targets service for the current higher-variance demand while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders consistently arrived same period), so keep promised lead time. Demand shows a sustained higher regime starting Period 31 (Periods 31\u201341 recent avg elevated vs earlier). I choose L=default to reflect promised 0-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 31\u201341) to target the current sustained regime and avoid diluting with older low-demand weeks. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=11 to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while limiting excess inventory from older data; they help the OR backend produce a base stock tuned to the current regime and reduce stockouts without excessive holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a large one-week demand spike in Period 42 (demand=1007) likely from a calendar/promotional event (Black Friday/Cyber week). All observed lead times have been 0 so far. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover this period's demand plus risk of further elevated demand. I choose L=default (use promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the very recent regime including the spike (weeks 38\u201342) so the base-stock will reflect elevated short-term demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent volatility. This biases orders upward to avoid stockouts during the apparent promotional spike while the carry-over rule is conservative about recording sustained shifts.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods; recent two periods show very large demand spikes (P42 demand=1007, P43=771) but this is only a 2-period event and not yet a sustained regime shift. To avoid overreacting to a short spike and given no evidence of delayed/lost shipments, use default lead time and default demand statistics (all-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L)). This balances service level stability vs. holding cost while awaiting confirmation of any new regime.

======================================================================

Historical observed lead times have been 0 consistently. To avoid overreacting to short holiday volatility, use promised lead time and population-level demand moments: L=default (promised 0). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service and holding cost given current inventory cushion.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=213, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a short-lived huge spike (Periods 42\u201343) followed by two low weeks (Periods 44\u201345 = 88,77). No sustained (>3 periods) new regime detected. Keep promised lead time. Use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to downweight the two extreme spikes while still partially incorporating them, giving a responsive but smoothed forecast. Keep sigma_hat default (use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L)) since variance was high but no sustained lower-volatility regime is confirmed. These choices aim to avoid over-ordering after the recent spikes while preserving service via modest safety stock.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=231, in-transit=0. Recent history shows large, short December spikes (Periods 42\u201344) but no persistent new regime beyond the previously recorded shifts. Promised lead time has consistently been observed as 0 in concluded periods, so keep L at default to match supplier promise. To balance the large recent spikes while avoiding excessive holding cost on a likely transient holiday surge, use an EWMA that emphasizes recent demand but not overwhelmingly so (gamma=0.3). Keep sigma_hat at default to let the backend use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This favors service for elevated recent demand while limiting inventory growth against holding cost.
