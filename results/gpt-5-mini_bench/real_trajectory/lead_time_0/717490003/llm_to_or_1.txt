Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent observed weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 28.8 units/week with high variance (std \u224817.64). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=0 with no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time. Use promised lead time (default) and historical-sample based demand/volatility: mu_hat default => (1+L)*mean of all samples = 28.8; sigma_hat default => sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples \u224817.64. This balances service level and holding cost by relying on full-sample estimates until we observe concluded arrivals or a sustained regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-02-18. On-hand=8, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed in P1 arrived in P1 (observed lead_time=0). No sustained demand regime change detected (recent demand: P1 sold=21; historical samples available). Use promised/default lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance for base-stock and cap calculations.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times: Period1 order lead_time=0, Period2 order lead_time=0 \u2192 no evidence of delays or lost shipments; actual lead time appears 0. Recent demands (history) show no sustained regime shift. Choose L by calculating average observed lead times to confirm 0. Use default demand and volatility scaling so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full historical samples given limited data while keeping policy responsive to observed zero lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent realized demands (Periods1-3): 21, 43, 79 \u2014 materially above earlier historical weekly mean (~28.8). All observed order arrivals in concludes show lead_time=0. To be responsive to the recent uplift, set lead time via observed average and base-stock demand estimate using the most recent 3 periods. Chosen methods: L=calculate (observed lead times are 0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture recent demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters increase target stock to serve elevated demand while sigma captures short-run variability; using recent_N keeps the model adaptive without overreacting to single-period noise.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in Periods 1-3: recent mean=47.67 vs prior sample mean=28.80 (+65%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead_times = 0 for all arrivals \u2192 use calculated lead time. Recent demand shows an elevated regime; last 4 period demands = [21,43,79,39], mean=45.5. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current higher mean and volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock appropriately while respecting holding cost. No overdue or lost shipments observed.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, recent demand (Periods 3-5)= [79,39,48], recent mean=55.33 which is well above earlier historical mean (~28.8) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To respond quickly while limiting holding cost, keep lead time as promised (default=0) but size forecasts using the most recent 3 periods to capture the new regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 so the OR backend targets a base-stock tuned to current elevated mean and observed volatility.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 3 demands: 39, 48, 122) with on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 \u2014 immediate replenishment needed. Lead times observed in concluded history are consistently 0, so use calculate to let backend confirm average observed lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (captures the most recent short-run mean ~69.67 and volatility driven by the 122 spike). These choices bias orders toward higher service (raising base stock) to avoid lost sales while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated risk to size safety stock appropriately.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 each period (orders placed arrived same period). Recent demand has risen sharply (periods 3-7: 79,39,48,122,148) indicating a new high-demand regime. I set L by calculate to use observed lead times (0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current elevated mean and volatility ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands \u224887.2). This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given zero lead time while sigma_hat recent_N increases safety stock to balance holding cost vs frequent lost sales.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 3: mean(P3-7)=87.2 vs prior sample mean=28.8 (+203%), sustained across 5 periods

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1-8) are all 0 \u2014 use calculated average to confirm L=0. Demand shows a sustained higher regime from Period 3\u20138 (mean \u2248 87.2) vs earlier sample mean 28.8; use recent_N on demand to capture new regime. Choose N=6 (regime length P3\u2013P8 = 6, N = max(min(6,20),3)=6). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings raise base_stock to cover the higher recent demand while keeping holding tradeoff aligned (profit=holding so q=0.5 handled by OR engine).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=31, in-transit=0. Recent demand remains in a higher regime (recent 5-week mean ~97.2 units vs historical ~28.8). All concluded arrivals show lead time = 0 periods. To cover immediate demand while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised/default lead time (0) and base forecasts on the most recent 5-week regime for mean and volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand without overcommitting to long tails.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22. Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime (Periods 6-10: 122,148,108,60,74) vs earlier low baseline; on-hand=24, in-transit=0. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show 0). To protect service during the elevated regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (capture last 5 weeks mean and volatility). L set to default (promised 0). This raises target base_stock to match current high demand while sigma from recent 5 weeks captures current variability and balances profit vs holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been high and sustained since early periods (many weeks with demand >> Jan baseline). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to meet current elevated regime. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 0, so use default promised lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime I use recent_N=9 (Periods 3\u201311) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend will base base_stock on the up-to-date mean/volatility and balance service level vs holding cost (profit=holding \u2192 q=0.5). No overdue deliveries or lost shipments indicated in concluded messages.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period (orders placed arrived same period across many periods), so use calculated lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 3 and is sustained through Period 12 (10 periods); use recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current elevated mean and volatility. This raises the base_stock to meet current demand while accounting for holding cost via the OR backend's service-level tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=30, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals visible. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. Demand shifted upward starting around Period 3 and remained elevated (see carry-over). To keep service while limiting holding cost I use observed lead time average and recent-demand estimates over the sustained high-demand regime (last 12 periods) so the OR engine builds a base-stock reflecting the higher recent mean and corresponding volatility.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=17, in-transit=0; no overdue or lost shipments (historical concludes show lead_time=0 consistently). Demand has shifted upward earlier (recorded in carry-over) and recent volatility exists. Use promised lead time (default) since all concluded arrivals show L=0. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (most recent 5 demand observations reflect current mean). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overweighting older low-demand samples; with profit=holding, target service quantile=0.5, so base_stock=mu_hat will balance fill rate vs holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since early periods (carry-over notes). Promised lead time has consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use default lead time. To capture the current high-demand regime, set demand forecasts from the most recent 10 periods (Period 7\u201316 demands: 148,108,60,74,104,160,45,70,72,120) which reflects current mean/volatility. Using recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the elevated, sustained demand while avoiding stale low-demand samples; this balances service (meet frequent large weekly peaks) versus holding cost given profit=holding so z* neutral.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17. Historical samples (early 2019) mean=28.8 but demand increased and sustained at higher levels since Period 3. Recent demands (Periods 13-18): [45,70,72,120,99,62], recent mean=78.0. On-hand=30, in-transit=0; promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0. I set L=default to trust promised lead time (concluded evidence matches). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (captures recent mean 78 and recent variability) so the OR backend raises base-stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods, so use default promised lead time. Recent demand is substantially higher than early samples and sustained; use recent_N (last 5 periods: P15-19 demands = 72,120,99,62,94) to capture the current regime for both mean and volatility. This biases orders toward meeting current elevated demand while the OR engine will balance service vs holding given profit=holding.

All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. I set L=default to use promised 0. I choose mu_hat recent_N N=5 and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 so the OR engine targets the current high-demand regime (short review+lead multiplier (1+L)=1) and captures recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has trended higher with a large spike at Period 21 (211) and elevated weekly demand in Periods 17-21 (97,62,94,100,211). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. To respond to the recent higher demand while keeping sensitivity to the spike, set L to promised (default=0) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 weeks (captures the current regime while smoothing the single extreme week). This raises the target base-stock to cover the current elevated demand and lets the OR backend trade service level vs holding cost using observed volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. Recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 62,94,100,211,146; mean\u2248122.6). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need orders to cover immediate demand. Promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show L=0), so keep L=default. To reflect the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the latest mean over the review+lead period). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility for safety stock. These parameters bias the OR backend toward stocking for the recent high demand while keeping variability-driven safety stock.

Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=0 consistently (orders in Periods 1-23 all arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has been elevated recently; I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility (last 5 demands: 94,100,211,146,106 \u2192 elevated mean) to capture the current high-demand regime and avoid underordering. These parameters raise the base-stock to protect service level while sigma estimated from recent data prevents overreacting to a single spike, balancing profit vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 20-24) show a higher sustained demand regime (~100-211/week) vs earlier samples; supply has been reliable with observed lead_time=0 historically. To respond to the sustained higher demand, keep L as default (promised 0) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine targets stock for the recent high-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to older low samples. This balances service (capture profit) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime since early periods (carry-over notes: large, persistent demand increases). On-hand=48, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Use promised lead time (default L=0) since all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 (uses the most recent ~20 weeks to reflect the new mean over the review+lead period). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago low-variance samples. These choices bias orders upward to meet elevated demand while the backend's capped policy limits extreme ordering and balances service vs holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving same period (observed lead_time=0 across many periods) so use promised lead time. Demand has been elevated and variable in recent months; to capture the recent high-demand regime use recent_N over recent samples to bias the forecast and variability toward current demand levels. Chosen methods: L=default (promised 0); mu_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent demand average across the last 20 periods; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These settings increase target base-stock to improve service during sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost considered via the backend cap.

Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201328) show every order arrived same period (arrived=ordered, lead_time=0) so actual lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand has been elevated and variable since Period 3 (historical samples provided); I rely on the backend's full-sample demand estimate rather than short-window tweaks. Choose L by calculating observed lead times (will be 0). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost and leverages full history.

Demand has settled into a higher regime vs initial samples; recent 5-week mean \u224887 units (Periods 25-29 = 86,82,59,90,118). To target service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), use promised lead time (default 0) and base mu_hat/sigma_hat on the most recent short-run regime. Selected L=default to reflect observed 0 lead time. Selected mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and capture current elevated demand. Selected sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility around the new regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=36, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks P26-30: 82,59,90,118,51) has mean ~80, so I target the (1+L)-period demand using the most recent 5 samples to capture current regime and recent volatility. I therefore keep L as default (promised 0, confirmed by concludes) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the most relevant recent window; this balances service vs holding given equal profit and holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=52, in-transit=0. Historical baseline mean=28.8 but demand has been higher and volatile since early periods (carry-over detected regime shifts). Promised lead time observed as 0 in concluded history, so keep L as default. To respond to the recent higher/variable demand while limiting holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent demand (last 5 periods) to capture the most recent regime and volatility without overreacting to older low-demand samples. This yields responsive (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std inputs for the OR backend balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent weeks show demand variability with a mid-summer high and a pullback in the last 3\u20135 weeks (demands P28-32 = 90,118,51,28,37). On-hand=33, in-transit=0 so I want the forecast to reflect the most recent regime while not overreacting to a short dip. Use default lead time (promised = 0, all concluded LT=0). For demand mean and volatility use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest mixed regime (mean of last 5 \u224864.8) and recent variability; this balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Recent 5-week demand (Periods 30-34) has settled lower (samples: 51, 28, 37, 51, 38; recent mean \u224841) versus earlier high-volume regime. Use promised lead time (0) since all concluded orders show lead_time=0. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to prioritize the current lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce inventory targeting toward the recent mean demand and balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1/unit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0; no new sustained demand regime change since prior carry-over insights. Promised lead time (0) and default demand statistics will be used so the OR backend computes base_stock from the full-sample mean/variance. This keeps parameters aligned with observed zero lead time and leverages all historical demand data while avoiding overreacting to recent noise.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. Recent demand has been low (Periods 34-38 demands: 38,26,18,24,17) and on-hand=57 with in-transit=0. No overdue arrivals observed; historical actual lead time has been 0. To respond to the recent lower-demand regime while preserving service, use promised lead time (default) and base forecasts anchored to the most recent 5 weeks to reflect the downward shift. This keeps orders small relative to current on-hand, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods \u2192 use promised lead time (default). Recent demand has fallen: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 35-39) = [26,18,24,17,15], recent mean\u224820; I choose recent_N for mu_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid overweighting earlier high peaks. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture current volatility. With L=default (0), (1+L)\xd7mean uses the recent mean to set a smaller base-stock, reducing holding cost while covering expected next-period demand. On-hand 42 covers ~2\xd7 expected weekly demand, so parameters limit new ordering.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has fallen markedly: Periods 35-40 demand sequence = [26,18,24,17,15,11], mean \u2248 18.5 and low variance. On-hand=31, in-transit=0; with profit=holding ($1/$1) the OR backend targets median service (z*=0). I choose L=default because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To reflect the recent low-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 6 concluded demand periods (N=6) so the backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and corresponding std; this reduces replenishment vs long-run higher means and avoids excess holding while maintaining service for the new lower demand level.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 35: mean(P35-40)=18.5 vs prior sample mean=28.8 (\u221235.8%), sustained for 6 periods

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted down starting Period 35 (sustained low demand through Period 41). Promised lead time historically observed as 0; use default promised lead time to keep backend assumption aligned. To reflect the confirmed lower-demand regime (P35\u2013P41, 7 periods), set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 so the forecast (1+L)*mean uses the most recent low-demand samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=7 to reflect reduced recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock and cap orders to avoid excess holding costs while maintaining service in the new low-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 35 (carry-over: mean P35-40=18.5, \u221235.8% vs prior). Promised lead time is 0 and historically arrivals match promised L=0, so use default lead time. To reflect the lower regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (periods 35\u201342) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and scaled recent std; this reduces target base-stock and limits holding cost while preserving service for the confirmed low-demand periods.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-9). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (no evidence of delayed or lost shipments); recent orders arrived when placed. Demand history includes prior regime shifts already captured in carry-over insights, but no new sustained change in the last concluded periods. Given lead_time confirmed as 0 and symmetric profit/holding (profit=holding), use default historical demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from all samples. This balances service (using full-sample mean) against holding cost without overreacting to short blips.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16. Recent demand has been low (Periods 40-44 demands = 11,12,22,7,8; recent mean \u2248 12). On-hand=59, in-transit=0 \u2014 current inventory comfortably covers one period of recent demand. No evidence of lead-time change (historical concluded lead_time=0). To avoid holding cost while matching current low demand, set lead time to default (promised 0) and use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the recent low regime; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture current volatility. This biases orders down to preserve profit minus holding cost given high holding cost equal to profit.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently; no recent lost shipments. Recent demand has been low since Period 35 (carry-over notes capture earlier regime shifts). To avoid overfitting to short fluctuations and because profit=holding ($1/$1) implies a 50% critical fractile, I use promised lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This keeps service level balanced versus holding cost given current ample on-hand inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders that arrived show lead_time=0). Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 35 (carry-over insight: mean(P35-40)=18.5); recent 12 periods (P35-46) show persistently lower demand. I set L to default to use the promised lead time=0 (confirmed by concluded arrivals). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained lower-demand regime (N chosen = regime length 12, within allowed bounds). This keeps target base_stock aligned with the lower recent mean, avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service. Current on-hand (48) plus zero in-transit provides coverage \u2014 using recent demand stats reduces future over-ordering risk given holding cost equals profit.
