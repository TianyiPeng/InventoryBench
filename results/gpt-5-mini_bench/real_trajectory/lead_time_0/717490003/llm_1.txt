Current period reported demand = 47 (Period 1, 2019-02-11), indicating demand can still spike but no sustained increase is yet observed. Lead time: supplier promised 0; no concluded arrivals available to contradict that, so assume same-period arrival but remain cautious. Inventory/pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Forecast/demand logic: with high holding cost equal to profit ($1/unit), overstock is costly; aim to meet immediate expected demand rather than carry safety stock. Given current observed period demand = 47 and no evidence of sustained regime shift or delayed shipments, place an order to cover one period of expected demand (47 units).",
