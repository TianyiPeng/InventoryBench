Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand history (5 samples from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) shows mean \u2248 47.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals to infer a lead-time shift. Promised lead time is used (default) and demand parameters use full-sample defaults to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility; this is conservative given no evidence of regime change or lost shipments. Profit/holding (19/1) imply high service-level weight; relying on backend base-stock calculation balances service vs holding cost.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand history (weekly samples: 35,53,41,57,52) gives mean \u224847.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; Period 1 order (63) arrived with observed lead_time=0. No evidence of delays or regime shifts. Use calculated lead time (avg observed = 0) and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let OR engine set base-stock consistent with historical weekly demand and current promised lead time while avoiding unsupported explicit changes.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly mean (Jan samples) ~47.6, but recent sales show a sharp uptick: Period1 demand=71 and Period2 demand=109. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and past two orders arrived same period (observed lead_time=0). I keep L as default (promised=0). To respond to the recent demand regime (two high weeks) I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=2 to capture the elevated short-run mean (1+L)*mean(last2)=~90 units. For variability I use recent_N N=2 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service while keeping holding exposure limited given holding cost=$1 and only two periods of elevated demand evidence.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1345.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1-3 had lead_time=0 (confirmed). Recent observed demand in concluded periods: 71, 109, 74 (Periods 1-3) \u2014 meaning a sustained upward shift vs. historical sample mean (47.6). To capture the confirmed 0-period lead time I use 'calculate' for L. To reflect the new higher demand regime I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, improving service while limiting holding cost given current on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed (Periods 1-3): recent avg demand = 84.7 vs historical avg = 47.6 (+78%); lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Period1-3 orders arrived same period).

Daily Profit: $1463.00, Daily Holding Cost: $43.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1420.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent concluded history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 1-3) and confirmed lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period). On-hand=43, in-transit=0; with lead time 0 current stock must cover this period's demand. I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) which matches observed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to focus the forecast on the confirmed high-demand regime (use last 3 demand samples from the high regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(recent 3). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This biases ordering toward higher service to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost in check.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has settled above historical pre-shift levels: last 5 period demands = [71,109,74,77,59], mean \u224878, std elevated. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded periods. On-hand=60, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded arrivals confirm 0 lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses last 5 samples) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase target base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping holding risk measured by recent variability.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand has risen above historical average (early periods avg ~84.7 vs historical ~47.6); on-hand=39, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time=0 has been consistently observed. I choose L=default to trust the promised 0-day lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to bias the forecast toward the more recent higher-demand regime while avoiding overreacting to a single week; mu_hat will therefore be (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 samples. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so variability reflects recent weeks. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service for the higher recent demand but keep variability and cap calculations anchored to recent data to limit excess holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01 (Period 8). Recent demand has shifted up vs historical: last 7 demands (Periods 1-7) average \u224876.6 vs historical sample mean \u224847.6. On-hand=33, in-transit=0; lead time has been confirmed as 0 in concluded periods. To reflect the sustained higher regime, set lead time to promised (default=0) and use recent data for demand and volatility. I choose recent_N with N=7 to capture the full post-shift regime (Periods 1-7). This increases target base_stock to serve (1+L) periods of higher demand while sigma from recent_N raises safety stock; with profit >> holding cost this raises service level while keeping holding cost reasonable given confirmed higher demand and zero lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand has risen well above historical (recent weeks ~70\u201376 vs historical ~47.6). No in-transit stock and on-hand=31. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L=default (promised 0). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the last 8 observed demands, improving service while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Historical pre-study weekly mean = 47.6 but recent selling has been materially higher and sustained (Period1-9 mean \u224874.4). On-hand=38, in-transit=0; promised lead time = 0 and concluded history shows arrivals same period. I therefore keep lead time at default (promised 0) and set demand estimates using the recent regime (last 9 concluded periods) so the OR engine targets service for the sustained higher demand while limiting holding cost buildup.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). On-hand=64, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (Periods 1\u201310 arrivals same period). Recent demand shows a lower-but-stable level vs the early spike; last 5 demands (Periods 6\u201310) = [70,76,72,62,34], mean=62.8, std used from same window. Choose L='calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime and avoid the earlier spike influence. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward recent average demand (better service with low holding cost tradeoff given profit/holding ratio).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29 (Period 12). On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded orders show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Recent demand since the confirmed regime shift (Periods 4\u201311) is elevated versus older samples; I use the recent regime (Periods 4\u201311, length=8) to set demand estimates so the base-stock reflects the higher, sustained demand and limits stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind. Set L to use promised/confirmed 0. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to capture the current higher mean and volatility across the (1+L) review+lead period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals \u2192 actual lead time = 0. Demand recently elevated and variable; last 5 demand samples (Periods 8-12) average ~69 units/period, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime while avoiding overreacting to one-off spikes. Choices: L set by calculating observed lead times (confirm 0); mu_hat recent_N N=5 to target (1+L)*recent mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters give the OR backend a short lead-time (lower pipeline) and a demand-driven base stock to favor high service (profit) while keeping holding exposure manageable given low holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples show elevated recent demand versus older baseline; no evidence of missing shipments (all prior orders concluded with lead_time=0). To maintain service while limiting holding cost, use promised lead time (default L=0), set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current demand regime, and keep sigma_hat as default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher recent demand with modest holding cost (profit $19 vs holding $1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has been volatile but no new sustained regime shift since earlier confirmed increase; on-hand=36, in-transit=0 and lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded periods. Use promised/default lead time 0. Set demand forecast using recent 5 samples to capture the latest demand level and variability (balances service vs. holding cost given high profit relative to holding cost). Chosen methods: L=default to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals; mu_hat and sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to react to recent demand without overfitting short blips.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=33, in-transit=0. Historical baseline mean (provided samples) = 47.6, but recent periods show a higher regime (Periods 1-3 avg 84.7) and recent 5-week demand average is ~71.2; lead times observed in conclude messages are consistently 0. To balance service and holding cost I set lead time by observed data (calculate). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand regime (weights latest variability and mean), allowing the OR backend to size base-stock to recent demand while avoiding overstock from older low-demand samples.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. History shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed) and a sustained higher demand regime since Period 4. I set L to default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the new regime (Periods 4\u201316) rather than the small pre-period sample; this scales mu_hat by (1+L)*mean of the most recent 13 demand observations to reflect elevated demand. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=13 so variability is estimated from the same recent regime. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service rate while keeping holding cost consideration via the OR engine's cap.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and mixed but elevated demand episodes; current on-hand=35, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 0 and past conclues confirm actual lead time=0; no overdue shipments. Given high profit vs holding (q\u22480.95) we favor the backend's default demand estimate using all samples to produce a high service-level base-stock. Methods chosen: use default lead time (promised 0), default mu_hat (1+L times mean of all samples) and default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L) times std of all samples) so OR backend applies its high-service calculation while respecting historical volatility.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 across many periods), so set L via calculate to confirm observed lead time.

Recent demand has been elevated vs early historical average; to reflect current regime I use a recent-sample forecast. Chosen parameters: L=default to trust promised lead time (0) consistent with concluded evidence; mu_hat=recent_N with N=10 to capture the recent higher mean demand over the last 10 periods; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent demand volatility. This raises the base-stock to improve service during sustained higher demand while sigma_hat ensures safety stock accounts for recent variability, balancing profit-driven service level against holding cost.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/22. Historical concludes show actual lead time continues to be 0 (orders arriving same period). Recent demand (Periods 14-23) averaged ~66.8 units/week, higher than the long-run Jan samples; I use a recent-N forecast to capture the up-to-date regime. L left at default (promised = 0) since concluded history confirms 0 lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=10 to reflect the last 10 weeks' mean and variability so the OR backend sets base-stock to cover current demand rates while controlling holding cost. On-hand=40 vs recent mean ~66.8 -> policy will order to replenish pipeline accordingly.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=22, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand has been materially higher than the very early historical baseline (carry-over previously recorded). To keep service with low promised lead time, use promised lead time (default). For demand forecast and volatility, use recent_N with N=20 to capture the recent higher-demand regime (uses last 20 demand observations) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand levels and variability; this balances higher fill-rate (profit-driven) against holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201326) consistently show arrivals same period => actual lead time = 0. Demand in most recent 5 periods (P22\u2013P26: 51,49,65,42,43) averages ~50 units/week. To keep pipeline aligned with current recent demand while avoiding excess holding, use promised/default lead time (0) and set demand forecasts based on the last 5 weeks for both mean and volatility. This yields a (1+L)-scaled mean reflecting current regime and a recent volatility estimate to size safety stock appropriately given profit/holding tradeoff.

To let the OR engine use the full historical sample base and confirmed promised lead time, I keep L as default (promised), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples).

Historical data show earlier regime shift evidence was captured previously; lead time has been consistently observed as 0. To avoid overstock given current moderate recent demand and low holding cost, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its full-sample mean/variance (stable long-run estimate) while keeping orders conservative relative to on-hand inventory.

I keep L as default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to make the forecast responsive to the lower recent demand; on-hand (~53) covers ~1.4\xd7 the recent weekly demand, avoiding stockouts while limiting holding cost.

Lead time has consistently observed as 0 periods. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0), mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (robust to no clear recent regime), and sigma_hat=default to reflect overall demand volatility. This keeps orders sized by long-run demand while the zero observed lead time keeps review+lead coverage minimal, balancing service level against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Recent weeks show moderate demand (~30-60 units) after the earlier elevated regime; no new sustained shift in last 3+ periods. Keep promised lead time (default L=0) because concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time. Use recent_N for mu_hat (N=5) to bias forecast to most recent demand levels and avoid overordering from older high-volume weeks. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend use long-run variability scaled by (1+L). This combination targets service with restrained inventory given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Recent realized weekly demand (most recent 5 concluded periods: P29-33) = [34,39,60,36,43], mean \u224842.4 \u2014 demand has moderated vs earlier spikes. Observed lead times have been consistently 0 in concluded history. To keep the OR engine responsive to the latest regime, set lead time to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend targets inventory to the most recent demand level and volatility rather than long-run averages.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=6, in-transit=0; recent sales remain around 40-80/wk with no new sustained shift and lead time consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. To restore service while limiting holding cost, I set L based on observed lead times and forecast demand from the most recent 5 weeks (captures current regime). High profit relative to holding cost implies a high service-target; the backend will convert these inputs into an appropriate base-stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=34, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently; no new sustained demand regime change in recent periods (demands fluctuate but no 3+-period consistent shift). To keep policy aligned with observed lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand mean/volatility so the OR engine computes base_stock from all samples. This balances service (observed fast replenishment) versus holding cost given current modest on-hand inventory and no overdue shipments.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=50, in-transit=0. Historical baseline mean=47.6 (Jan samples). Prior carry-over confirmed a demand uplift in Periods 1-3 and lead time=0. Recent 5-week demand (Periods 35-39 = 46,44,83,47,39) averages \u224851.8, suggesting demand modestly above baseline but no new sustained regime shift. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to adapt to the short-term level while keeping responsiveness; keep sigma_hat at default to reflect overall historical volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (capture recent uptick) vs holding cost by avoiding over-reacting to a single high week (we use 5 weeks).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time 0) and no new lead-time delays. Recent demand (Periods 36-40): [44, 83, 47, 39, 35], recent mean \u224849.6 which is below the earlier high-regime average; I choose to forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current lower demand trend while keeping lead time at promised 0. Using recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat keeps the (1+L)-period forecast responsive to the latest regime and limits excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $19 profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $718.00

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 37-41) demand = [83,47,39,35,40], recent mean \u224848.8 \u2014 current inventory likely under one-week demand. Historical lead times observed = 0 (concluded arrivals same period). I choose L=default to use promised lead time=0. To capture recent demand regime and be responsive to the latest weeks, I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands (~48.8). For variability I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to the latest observed demand while leveraging the confirmed same-period lead time to avoid excess pipeline inventory and reduce holding costs.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (orders in history arrived same period). Recent demands show variability including a large week (Period 42 demand=99) but no new sustained regime change beyond the previously recorded shift at Period 4. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand statistics, use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level vs holding cost given stable same-period fulfillment and avoids overreacting to single high-demand weeks.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has one large spike (Period 42=99) but no sustained regime change over 3+ periods. To avoid overreacting to the spike and because lead time is confirmed 0, use defaults so backend uses full historical mean/std scaled by (1+L). This balances service level and holding cost given stable demand regime.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=54, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand shows some volatility with a one-off spike (Period 42=99) but last several weeks returned to mid-30s/40s. To balance service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1) I keep promised lead time (default=0) and use a recent-window forecast to adapt to the latest demand regime: recent_N (last 5 weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current mean/variance while avoiding over-weighting the single spike. This yields a (1+L)-adjusted forecast and volatility that helps the OR backend set a base stock that trades off fill rate vs holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demands in history hover in the 30\u201390 range with no new sustained regime shift since the previously recorded Period 4 change. To keep the OR engine aligned with observed same-day arrivals and long-run demand statistics, I use default lead time and default demand estimators so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This preserves service from same-period replenishment while letting the engine trade off profit vs holding cost via its internal z* calculation.

Demand has shown a sustained higher regime since Period 4; to capture recent behavior I use a recent-N demand estimate over the latest 20 samples for mu_hat. Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend compute volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices prioritize meeting the elevated recent demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to control inventory holding cost.
