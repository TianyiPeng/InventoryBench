Supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time unknown; cannot confirm delays without concluded arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Decision rule: promised L=0 implies target coverage = 1 period (current week). Balance high unit profit ($19) vs $1 holding cost; favor meeting expected demand rather than stocking large excess. Forecast current-period demand ~140 units (compromise between recent weeks and smoothing). Place order to cover one period demand so stock can meet customers this period if supplier honors promised 0 lead time; if actual lead_time>0 some stockout risk exists but we have no evidence to adjust.",
