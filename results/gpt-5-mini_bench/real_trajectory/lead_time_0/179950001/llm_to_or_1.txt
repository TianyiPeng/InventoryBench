Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 179950001 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks, early Jan\u2013Feb 2019) show modest and stable demand; no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations exist yet. Promised lead time used (method: default). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014conservative given no evidence of regime change or shipment delays. This balances service level vs holding cost under equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=25, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed P1 arrived P1 (lead_time=0). No sustained changepoint in demand history (5 historical weekly samples mean=64.6). Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend uses (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded lead times: Period1=0, Period2=0 \u2192 no evidence of delayed or lost shipments. Recent demand: P1=40, P2=87; historical sample mean ~64.6. No sustained regime change (only two recent periods, variability expected). Use calculated lead time (average observed = 0) so OR backend knows actual recent performance. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so forecasts rely on full historical sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L)=1; this balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost and no clear trend.

Daily Reward (R_t): $49.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-3) = [40, 87, 57]; historical older samples (Jan) are lower but recent three weeks show higher, variable demand. On-hand=8, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed. Observed lead times for Periods 1-3 arrivals were 0 periods. I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm same-period arrivals. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher recent mean: mu_hat uses the mean of the last 3 demands scaled by (1+L). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the now-higher recent demand while keeping holding exposure limited since L=0 and holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1,P2,P3 orders arrived same period).

Daily Reward (R_t): $60.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (Period1-4 arrivals same period). Current on-hand=1, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history (samples) mean ~64.6/week; recent weeks average ~61. I choose default lead time (use promised L=0) and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses all historical samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat, balancing service level against holding cost given symmetric profit and holding ($1:$1).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has been volatile with a noticeable uptick in Period 5 (demands: P1=40, P2=87, P3=57, P4=61, P5=98). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current period plus lead time. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in recent history, so use default promised L to let backend assume same-period arrivals. To capture the recent demand regime (including the spike) I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std using the five most recent samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1). No evidence of lost shipments now.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands P1-P6 show a recent regime (demands: 40,87,57,61,98,50) with higher variance than earlier samples; lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over. To reflect the recent demand pattern I set L=default (use promised 0). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to let the OR engine base the base-stock on the recent mean across these 6 concluded periods, and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture the current elevated volatility. This balances service (capture recent demand spikes) against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and zero lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times (Periods 1\u20137) are consistently 0 \u2192 use observed avg. Demand history shows variability but no sustained regime change (no 3+ period shift), so use population defaults for demand mean/variance. Set L by calculating average observed lead time (0) so backend scales mu/sigma correctly for (1+L) review+lead horizon and balances service vs holding costs given Profit=Holding.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=18, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals (Periods 1-8) consistently show lead_time=0. I set L by calculate to use the observed lead times (avg=0). Demand forecast and volatility will use all available samples (mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This keeps parameters responsive to the established 0-period lead time and uses full-sample stats to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1\u20139) averages ~60 units/week (sample: 40,87,57,61,98,50,57,47,46). All past orders (P1\u2013P9) arrived same period confirming actual lead time = 0. On-hand=18, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Given confirmed 0 lead time and no clear sustained regime shift beyond normal weekly variability, use default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this balances service vs holding cost under symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times remain 0 (confirmed earlier), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has moderated vs. early spikes; I use a recent-N demand estimate to reflect current regime. Set L=default (promised 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture mean of last 5 demands (Periods 6-10 = 50,57,47,46,43 -> mean ~48.6 per period, scaled by 1+L). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility (std of those 5 ~4.76, scaled by sqrt(1+L)). This balances service (responsive to current lower mean) against holding cost given low profit/holding parity.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand stabilized ~45-60 units/week vs earlier higher variability; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current period demand. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I therefore use L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent stable regime (Periods 7-11 demands = 57,47,46,43,50; mean ~48.6) so the base-stock reflects current demand and avoids excess holding. For sigma I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (cover ~1 period of demand) with equal profit/holding costs (q\u22480.5) so minimal safety stock is appropriate.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P12) consistently show arrivals same period; lead time confirmed as 0. Recent demand has been stable with no sustained regime change. Profit and holding cost equal, so target service quantile is 0.5; use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, and promised lead time fallback (0). This keeps policy simple and responsive given same-period arrivals and no new evidence of shifts.

On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and several recent stockouts (P11\u2013P14 sold out) indicate demand is higher than safety stock but no evidence of lost/delayed shipments. Use inferred lead time=0 (calculate) and default demand estimates based on all historical samples to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (P1\u2013P15 all arrived same period). Recent weeks show high demand (several weeks in May with demand ~138\u2013139), but available historical demand samples (Jan) seed the estimator. I set L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to default so the OR backend uses the promised lead time (0) and the full-sample mean/std to compute base stock; this lets the engine balance service level vs holding cost given its internal formulas and the confirmed 0-period lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded orders show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (arrivals same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent periods show much higher realized demand (Periods 13-16 large weekly demand), but historical sample set provided to OR engine is the canonical source; to avoid overfitting to a short recent spike without a confirmed sustained regime change, use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps parameter updates conservative while leveraging the confirmed L=0 to allow same-period replenishment and let the backend cap/order accordingly.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has risen sharply since Period 13 (demands: 77,139,138,138,121), indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods. Use L=default (promised 0, confirmed historically). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 13\u201317 average). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to service higher demand while sigma_hat limits over-ordering via the OR cap.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed = 0 across many periods) and a clear demand regime shift beginning Period 13 with sustained higher demand (Period13-18 demands: 77,139,138,138,121,126; regime length=6). I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period reality. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (backend will scale by (1+L)). This increases target base-stock to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated volatility. No overdue shipments detected.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=2, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period). Recent demand has risen sharply (many periods with 120+ units), so we keep lead time = promised (0) and let the OR backend scale mu and sigma from full-sample statistics to reflect higher mean/variance. Using default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat lets backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples while preserving capped ordering behavior to limit excessive single-period replenishment and balance profit vs holding cost.

Lead time previously confirmed as 0; use promised/default L=0. Set mu_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current higher-demand regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher weekly demand while keeping holding cost tied to recent variability.

Recent weeks (Period13\u201321) show a sustained demand increase vs earlier samples (many weeks with demand 60\u2013140, regime length = 9 weeks), so I raise the forecast to reflect the new regime. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so keep L=default (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=9 to capture the higher mean and volatility from the last 9 demand observations; this increases the backend base-stock to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma_recent increases safety stock to balance holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. On-hand=42, in-transit=0. Historical base (earlier samples) mean\u224864.6/week, but since Period 14 (2019/5/13) demand has been persistently higher for 6 periods (demands: 139,138,138,121,126,122; mean\u2248130.7). This is a sustained regime shift so I use recent data to forecast. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior conclude messages, so choose default promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the new higher mean and volatility; this increases the backend base_stock to reduce stockouts while balancing holding cost given profit=holding cost. With on-hand=42 and no in-transit, the higher mu_hat will prompt replenishment to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand under the new regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 14: avg increased from 64.6 to 130.7 (+102%) based on Periods 14-19 (6 weeks) of sustained higher demand.

Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed across many periods) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (Periods 14\u201323 avg rose ~103% vs earlier). I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead time data. For demand I use recent_N=10 (Periods 14\u201323) to capture the new higher-demand regime (N = regime length = 10). Sigma also uses recent_N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align base-stock with the confirmed higher demand while keeping lead-time estimate anchored to observed same-period arrivals, balancing service level vs. holding cost.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead time consistently 0. Demand regime increased starting Period 14 and recent weeks remain elevated vs early-year. To capture the elevated demand regime I use recent_N=12 (covering recent Periods 13-24) for both demand mean and volatility so mu_hat reflects the higher recent average and sigma_hat captures recent variability. I keep L as default (promised lead time=0) since concluded arrivals confirm 0. This balances service (matching recent higher demand) against holding cost by sizing base-stock to recent demand estimates rather than dilute with old low-demand data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0. Recent demand (Periods 20-25 = 98,94,75,72,52,66) shows a lower recent mean (~76) vs earlier mid-year spikes; I will target the recent regime to avoid excess holding. Set L to default (promised 0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to reflect the most recent 6 weeks' mean and volatility so the OR backend sizes base-stock to recent demand and the cap to limit overly large orders given equal profit/holding (q=0.5, z*=0). This balances service vs. holding with current low pipeline and 39 on-hand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (confirmed in carry-over): weekly demand roughly doubled vs earlier periods. On-hand=8, in-transit=0; promised lead time historically confirmed as 0. To keep service during the higher-demand regime, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N for demand parameters to focus the forecast on the post-change regime: I choose N=13 (Periods 14\u201326 inclusive = 13 weeks of the new regime) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 13 samples and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std of last 13 samples. This raises the base-stock to reflect the higher mean while the recent_N sigma captures current volatility, balancing fill rate vs holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 with substantially higher weekly demand; recent demand since Period 14 (Periods 14\u201327) is the appropriate basis for forecasts. To keep service high given the higher regime while avoiding excess holding, set L to promised (0) and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent high-demand regime (recent_N using the last 14 samples, Periods 14\u201327). This focuses the OR backend on the new demand level while the zero lead time keeps orders responsive.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=15, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=0 (Periods 1-28 arrivals same period). A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 14 (higher mean through recent weeks). To adapt, keep L as promised (default) and use recent_N for demand estimates focused on the post-change regime: choose N=15 (Periods 14-28) to capture the new higher mean and volatility while smoothing short-term noise. These parameters will raise the base-stock to reduce lost sales in the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat from the same window controls safety stock so holding cost is not overly inflated.

Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 0 (Period 4) and a demand regime shift beginning Period 14 with sustained higher demand through recent weeks.

A sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (noted in carry-over) roughly doubled demand; recent higher-demand regime persists through Period 31. To reflect the current high-demand regime I set L to default (promised 0), and use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent regime samples. Regime length from Period 14\u219231 = 18 weeks, so N=18 (captures recent mean and variability). These parameters steer the OR backend to target a base stock appropriate for the new, higher-demand regime while keeping lead time as observed (0), balancing service vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=9, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 and a sustained demand regime shift upward starting Period 14. No shipments are overdue. I choose L=default to use the promised (and historically confirmed) 0-period lead time. To reflect the sustained higher recent demand, I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=10) so the backend forecasts using the last 10 weeks of demand (captures elevated regime). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=10) to estimate recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned to current high-demand regime while using recent variability for service-level sizing, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Demand regime elevated since Period 14 (sustained higher weekly demand); to capture the post-change demand level and recent variability I use a recent_N window covering the most recent 20 weeks so the OR backend builds base_stock from the elevated mean and observed volatility. Using L=default (promised/confirmed 0) avoids inflating pipeline; recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat balances service level (capture higher demand) against holding cost given current modest on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for this period's demand. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and a sustained demand uplift from Period 14 onward already recorded in carry-over. I therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so the OR engine uses all historical samples (including the confirmed higher-demand regime) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat. This balances service (cover one-period demand) against holding cost given profit=holding.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no cover for upcoming demand. Historical series shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 14; recent weeks (Periods 30-37) have mean demand ~116 with high volatility (including a 189 spike). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior conclude messages. To quickly replenish and reflect the recent demand regime, I set L to default (promised 0). I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=8 (last 8 weeks) to capture the most recent demand level and variability so the OR backend's base-stock (mu_hat) and safety stock (via sigma_hat) respond to the current higher-demand regime while limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=61, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed as 0 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (higher mean). Recent weeks remain elevated but variable (last 6 demands: P33-P38 = [189,95,90,97,98,48], mean \u2248102.8) so I use a short recent window to capture current demand level while keeping lead time at promised. Set L=default to keep lead time=0; mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect current elevated mean; sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost by using a focused recent estimate rather than the long-run mean.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=62, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 0 (confirmed in prior carry-over). Demand history shows a sustained higher regime from Periods 14-19 already recorded; recent weeks (Periods 36-39) are mixed but not a new sustained shift. With lead time=0, OR needs (1+L)=1 period coverage. I therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates (use full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L)) to let the backend compute base-stock and cap. This balances service level (capture the earlier higher-regime information in full-sample stats) against holding cost given current positive on-hand and no in-transit units.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=53, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 0 (carry-over). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 14 to a higher mean; to reflect the post-change demand level and recent volatility I use a recent-window estimate. L set to default (promised 0). mu_hat set to recent_N with N=12 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean over the last 12 demand samples (captures post-regime demand while smoothing short blips). sigma_hat set to recent_N with N=12 to capture recent demand variability for safety stock sizing. This keeps service high given higher regime mean while avoiding excessive holding given current on-hand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=57, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201341 all show 0). Demand has fallen in recent weeks (Period 38-41 demands = 48,41,29,33); this looks like a recent lower-demand regime vs prior summer spike. To avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost ($1/$1), use promised lead time (default). Forecast demand using a short recent window to capture the current low-demand level: recent_N for mu_hat with N=4 (last 4 weeks). Use recent_N for sigma_hat with N=4 to reflect recent lower volatility. This keeps base-stock low to limit holding cost while meeting current demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible from Period 42 conclude (so no pipeline). Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time 0. Recent demand shows a one-period Black Friday spike (Period 42 demand=227) but prior 6 weeks are moderate. I choose L=default (promised 0) because observed lead time has been consistently 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to focus the forecast on the most recent stable regime (Periods 36-41 demand = 97,98,48,41,29,33) and avoid overreacting to the single spike in Period 42. Using recent_N for sigma captures recent volatility. These settings keep base_stock responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while avoiding overstocking for a one-week holiday spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arriving same period). Demand shows a sustained higher regime beginning around Period 14 (previously recorded). Recent weeks include big holiday volatility (Period 42 spike) so I bias forecasts to recent data rather than full history. I set L to default (promised 0) since observed lead time is 0. For demand parameters I use recent_N (N=20) to focus the forecast/volatility on the most recent regime and capture late-year variability; this helps the OR backend size base stock to cover (1+L) periods of near-term demand while limiting excess holding during volatile holiday weeks.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 periods (confirmed earlier). Demand regime increased mid-year (Periods 14\u201319) and recent weeks show high variability including a single large spike (Period 42, demand=227) likely promotional. To be responsive to recent demand while smoothing out the one-off spike, I set L=default (promised 0). For demand level I use an EWMA to weight recent weeks more but damp extreme outliers (EWMA_gamma=0.4). For variability I use recent_N over the last 6 demand samples to capture current volatility. These choices aim to keep base_stock responsive to elevated recent demand while avoiding overreaction to the single extreme spike, balancing service vs holding costs.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 14 (avg rose ~+102%), which still appears in recent weeks (multiple weeks >80 units). Avoid using the single large stockout spike in Period 42 (demand=227) as it overstates mean. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed earlier), so use default lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime and seasonal behavior while smoothing extreme outliers, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (captures roughly last quarter of observations including recent Dec demand levels). This balances service (avoid stockouts given current higher regime) versus holding cost by focusing on recent regime rather than all-time mean.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals (lead_time observed = 0 across history) and a sustained demand regime increase starting Period 14; recent holiday weeks (Periods 42-46) saw large spikes but arrivals remained reliable. No overdue shipments visible. Given promised lead time 0 and strong history of 0 actual lead time, use default lead time. Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend leverages full historical signal (including the post-P14 higher demand) while its z* service-level tradeoff (profit=holding) is applied. This balances avoiding stockouts during elevated demand while limiting excess holding cost given holding cost equals profit.
