Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward regime: 2019-01-07=0, 01-14=0, 01-21=56, 01-28=216, 02-04=319. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no immediate coverage. Promised lead time is 0 and no concluded arrivals exist, so use default promised L to avoid assuming unseen delays. To capture the recent sustained demand jump (three most recent nonzero weeks), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (56,216,319) so the backend targets stock for the new higher-demand regime while keeping lead-time conservative. This balances service (avoid stockouts given surge) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: avg(2019-01-07..01-14)=0; avg(2019-01-21..2019-02-04)=197 (samples:56,216,319).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand regime (from 2019-01-21) is higher: samples 56,216,319. On-hand=139, in-transit=0; last period an order (P1) arrived same-period (observed lead_time=0). I set L to calculate to use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (regime length=3). Sigma also uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise base-stock to cover the (1+L) periods under the new higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost awareness.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: avg before=0 (2019-01-07..01-14), avg after=197 (2019-01-21..2019-02-04; samples 56,216,319).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent confirms actual lead time = 0 (Period1 and Period2 orders arrived same period). Demand regime since 2019-01-21 persists: samples [56,216,319], mean=197. On-hand=149, in-transit=0 \u2192 below one-period demand (197), so use recent regime estimates to capture higher post-2019-01-21 demand. Set L=default to keep promised lead time (observed arrivals confirm 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect (1+L)\xd7mean of the three higher-demand samples. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to capture current volatility from those three samples. These parameters raise target base-stock to meet elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders appropriately.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2899.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows actual lead_time=0 for orders placed in P1-P3. On-hand=198, in-transit=0; recent demands (concluded) = [276,207,163] indicating the post-2019-01-21 higher-demand regime persists. I set L to use observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current high-demand regime (uses (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples). For volatility I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect observed short-run variability. These settings bias orders toward meeting current elevated demand while keeping sigma tied to recent variability to avoid excessive safety stock given low holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=126, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 in Periods 1-4 (orders placed each period arrived same period). Recent demand regime confirmed starting 2019-01-21: last 3 samples = [56,216,319], mean=197. I set L by calculating observed lead times (average=0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher regime (mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align ordering to cover (L+1) periods of the new regime while avoiding overreliance on older zero-demand data.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent concluded periods (P1\u2013P5) show consistent positive demand after the Jan-21 regime shift (recent sales: 276,207,163,184,158; avg\u2248198). All observed arrivals in history have lead_time=0. I set L via recent observations to capture confirmed 0-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the forecast and volatility to the new higher-demand regime (N=5 covers the five recent post-changepoint samples). This keeps base stock responsive to the sustained demand increase while avoiding overstating variability; no overdue/lost shipments to adjust for.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=148, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. Historical concluded lead_times = 0 each arrival period \u2192 set L by calculating observed average. Demand after 2019-01-21 shifted to a higher regime (samples since then = periods 1\u20136 demands: 276,207,163,184,158,129). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts over the current post-changepoint regime (covers (1+L) review+lead). This balances service (capture higher recent average demand) vs holding cost by relying on recent demand and observed zero lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 in Periods 1-7). Recent demand has moderated from the early spike; last 7 demands = [276,207,163,184,158,129,169] with a lower stable regime in the last 5 periods. I set L by calculation (average observed lead times = 0) to match confirmed behavior. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime (limits overweighting early spike). Sigma is also recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the current lower mean while preserving safety from recent variability, reducing holding cost given on-hand=102 and zero in-transit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand stabilized around mid-high 100s\u2013200s (last 8 demands: 276,207,163,184,158,129,169,193). On-hand=1, in-transit=0 so we are effectively out this period unless replenished. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently. Set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 0. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast and variability to the most recent regime (covers the sustained post-2019-01-21 higher-demand regime). This gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period demand estimate based on the latest 8 samples, balancing service (avoid stockouts from current ~170\u2013190 weekly demand) against holding cost given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period) and a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21. On-hand=153, in-transit=0; upcoming demand will occur after decision so pipeline must cover (1+L) periods. I choose L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=9 (all available post-regime samples) to capture the current elevated mean and recent variability; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=9 to reflect recent volatility. These settings bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while the low holding cost ($1 vs profit $19) supports moderate safety stock rather than aggressive cuts to inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1363.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201310) shows consistent actual lead time = 0 (all concluded arrivals report lead_time 0). On-hand=176, in-transit=0 so available inventory is adequate for short-term. Demand history (demands per concluded period = [276,207,163,184,158,129,169,193,104,81]) yields mean \u2248166 units/week and std \u224852. I select L=default to trust the promised/observed lead time of 0; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples. This balances service (use full-sample mean reflecting the post-regime demand) versus holding cost given profit/holding ratio (z derived in backend). No evidence of lost shipments or new sustained regime since prior insight.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent demand (Periods 1\u201311) shows a sustained post-2019-01-21 higher regime; no in-transit units and on-hand=211 so no overdue arrivals to account for. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 each period, so use calculate to confirm L=0. To capture current demand regime and recent volatility, use recent_N on the most recent 11 demand samples (Periods 1\u201311). These params (L=calculate, mu_hat recent_N N=11, sigma_hat recent_N N=11) give the OR backend a (1+L)-period demand forecast and recent volatility to set a high service level (q\u22480.95 given profit/holding) while avoiding excessive holdings given current ample on-hand inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Recent weekly demand (Periods 7\u201312) shows lower, stable average vs earlier spike; historical concluded lead times are all 0. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm average observed lead time (backed by concludes). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current post-spike regime (periods 7\u201312 mean \u2248122 units); sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility (~47 units). These parameters keep base-stock responsive to the new lower-demand regime while relying on observed lead-time behavior to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent realized lead time consistently 0 in concluded history (orders always arrived same period). On-hand=134, in-transit=0 so no overdue shipments. Demand has settled lower than the early Jan spike; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [104,81,90,93,66], indicating a recent lower regime. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms it. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent stable demand regime, which reduces overstock risk while preserving service given current lower demand and low holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=75, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Historical concludes consistently show lead_time=0. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $19, holding $1 \u2192 high service target), I use recent demand to capture the current regime: set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=7 for \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 so the backend bases base-stock on the current observed mean and volatility rather than older spike samples.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent demand has settled well below the early-February spike; last 8 periods (P8\u2013P15) demand = [193,104,81,90,93,66,59,48], avg \u2248 91.75. On-hand=124, in-transit=0 (no overdue shipments). Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0, so set L to calculated average of observed lead times (0). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat to target the current low-demand regime (N chosen = recent regime length = 8) so base_stock reflects current demand (1+L periods). Use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These settings reduce excess holding while maintaining service for the current regime.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently \u2014 use promised/default lead time. Demand shows a sustained downshift starting Period 8 (2019-04-01); to capture the recent lower regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 9 periods (Periods 8\u201316). This biases the base-stock toward the lower recent demand, reducing overstock and holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand downshift starting Period 8 (2019-04-01): avg Periods 1\u20137 = 183.7, avg Periods 8\u201316 = 85.3 (\u221254%), sustained over 9 periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). History shows actual lead time consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals indicate 0). Demand experienced a downshift starting Period 8 (2019-04-01) with avg Periods 1\u20137 = 183.7 vs avg Periods 8\u201316 = 85.3 (\u221254%), and recent weeks remain low (demands in Periods 10\u201317: 81,90,93,66,59,48,34,31). I set L to default (promised 0) because concluded lead times are 0. To capture the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat using N=10 (regime length \u224810 periods) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 10 samples; this reduces target base-stock to reflect the lower demand and limits excess holding costs given low holding cost vs profit.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows a sustained demand downshift starting Period 8 (2019-04-01): avg Periods 1\u20137 \u2248183.7 vs Periods 8\u201316 \u224885.3 (\u221254%), and the most recent 11 periods remain low. On-hand=136, in-transit=0 so current stock covers several weeks at the lower demand. Actual observed lead time has been consistently 0 (orders in conclude messages arrived same period). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I set L to default (promised=0, confirmed by conclude history) and use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock sized to the new lower mean and its recent volatility; this reduces overstock risk while preserving service under current demand levels.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent history shows a sustained demand downshift beginning Period 8 (2019-04-01) \u2014 average demand in recent regime (Periods 8\u201319) is much lower than earlier weeks. On-hand=134, in-transit=0 so no incoming replenishment expected. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so use default promised L to keep OR backend assumptions aligned. For demand forecast I use a recent_N window to capture the post-changepoint regime (N=12 covers Periods 8\u201319) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets reflect the lower recent mean and volatility. This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given current lower demand and zero pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=138, in-transit=0 so current inventory covers several weeks at the lower regime \u2014 no overdue shipments. Observed lead times have been 0 in all concluded periods, so set L by calculating observed lead time. To align forecasting with the sustained lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (N=14 periods: Periods 8\u201321) so the OR backend targets a base-stock appropriate to current lower mean and volatility, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has downshifted since Period 8 (sustained lower mean ~85 historically) and the last several weeks show very low weekly demand (Periods 20-23: 5,9,9,6). On-hand=134, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand relative to recent weekly demand, so keep lead time at promised value and base forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-downshift regime (use the recent regime sample length: Periods 8\u201323 = 16 samples) so the OR engine targets service for the current low-demand regime and avoids excess holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=125, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 each period (orders arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Demand shows a sustained downshift beginning Period 8 (2019-04-01) with recent weekly demand low and stable (Periods 8\u201324 avg \u224885.3 earlier; recent weekly sales much lower in late June\u2013July). To keep inventory lean vs holding cost while preserving service, I base demand forecast on the recent downshift regime. Set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat capturing the post-downshift regime (N chosen to cover the regime length since Period 8). These parameters reduce target base-stock to reflect lower recent demand and lower variability, limiting excess holding costs while meeting near-term demand.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime beginning 2019-04-01 (Period 8) \u2014 average demand since then has been materially lower than earlier periods. On-hand=76, in-transit=0; all concluded arrivals indicate actual lead time = 0. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirms 0). For demand I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (capture current lower mean and volatility): N=18 weeks from Period 8 through Period 25. This reduces forecasted (1+L)-period demand and volatility to reflect the sustained downshift, lowering ordering to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service given current consumption.

Demand experienced a sustained downshift starting Period 8; use recent regime data to forecast. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the current low-demand regime (N=19 periods since Period 8) so the base-stock and cap reflect the lower mean and volatility, reducing overstock while protecting service.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=30, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. I set L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time. To react to the recent surge while limiting holding cost exposure, I use recent_N for demand estimates based on the last 3 periods (Period 25\u201327) which capture the new higher regime without over-weighting older lower-demand periods. sigma_hat also uses recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent history shows a lower baseline since Period 8 but a clear demand uptick beginning around Period 25 (period demands: P25..P28 = 58,71,101,74). On-hand=39, in-transit=0 so we must forecast (1+L) periods of demand to avoid stockouts while limiting holding cost. Lead times observed in concluded history are consistently 0, so use calculated lead time. For demand I use a recent_N window to capture the new higher regime while limiting noise; N=8 (P21\u2013P28) covers the immediate post-downshift period plus the recent spike. Use the same recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to raise base-stock to service the recent uptick but keep cap constraints to limit over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick starting Period 25: avg Periods 25\u201328 = 76 (samples 58,71,101,74) vs avg Periods 21\u201324 = 9 (samples 9,9,6,12); sustained 4 periods, large increase.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=5, in-transit=0. Historical conclues show actual lead time = 0 consistently (orders arrived same period). Demand regime: sustained uptick beginning Period 25 (demands P25..P29 = 58,71,101,74,100). I therefore keep L as default (promised lead time = 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 5 periods P25\u2013P29). This focuses the base-stock on the elevated recent mean while computing volatility from the same window; it balances service (capture uptick) versus holding cost by not averaging in the older low-demand periods.

All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. To respond to the sustained higher demand while avoiding overstating uncertainty, use promised lead time (default) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the recent uptick regime (recent_N N=6) so the OR engine sets a base-stock reflecting current higher mean and observed volatility.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (no delays or lost shipments). Demand shows a sustained uptick beginning Period 25; recent weekly demands (Periods 25\u201331) = [58,71,101,74,100,157,161]. I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 7). This raises target base-stock to improve service during the confirmed uptick while sigma_hat captures recent volatility to avoid excessive overstock.

Carry-over insight: Demand uptick starting Period 25 confirmed: avg(Periods 25\u201331)=103.14 (samples 58,71,101,74,100,157,161) vs avg(Periods 21\u201324)=9; sustained over 7 periods.

On-hand=25, in-transit=0 so no incoming stock visible. Historical concluded lead times have been 0; use promised lead time. Set L=default to match promised 0. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to size (1+L)-period demand to the confirmed higher regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility and avoid underordering given high recent peaks.

I set L to calculated average of observed lead times (0) to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (so backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the 9 most recent samples).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=64, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Demand regime: sustained uptick beginning Period 25 (Periods 25\u201334 show elevated demand vs earlier low-demand regime). I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) since all concluded lead times = 0. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the post-Period-25 higher-demand regime (use last 10 observed demand samples to set (1+L)*mean). For sigma I also use recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These settings make the OR backend target inventory appropriate for the new higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding by relying on recent samples and correct lead-time.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=94, in-transit=0. Historical lead times have been consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand regime: sustained uptick starting Period 25 (Periods 25\u201335 show elevated demand vs earlier low-season). To capture the current higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples from this uptick (use last 11 periods, Periods 25\u201335) so the OR backend computes base-stock tuned to the new mean and volatility. Using default lead time (promised=0) matches observed concluded lead times and avoids introducing artificial delay. This balances service (respond to sustained higher demand) while keeping holding cost considered via backend calculation.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=99, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 so use promised lead time. Demand has a sustained uptick since Period 25; recent high weekly demand (Periods 30\u201336: 157,161,146,342,214,190,184) justifies using a recent-window forecast to capture elevated mean and volatility. Choose L=default to reflect observed 0 lead-time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=7 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 7 demand samples; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to capture recent volatility. These parameters raise target base-stock to meet higher demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent history shows a sustained demand uptick beginning Period 25 (higher weekly sales since late July through current period). All observed lead times in concluded history are 0; average observed lead time = 0. I set L to calculated average of observed lead times. For demand I target the post-changepoint regime (Periods 25\u201337, 13 samples) using recent_N to capture the higher mean and volatility; sigma_hat uses the same recent window. These parameters steer the OR backend to a base-stock aligned with the new higher-demand regime while reflecting observed low lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Observed lead times from concluded history are consistently 0 periods (orders arrived same period). Demand shows a sustained uptick beginning Period 25 (confirmed in carry-over history); use recent regime data to forecast. Set L by calculating observed lead times (will be 0). Use recent_N (N=14, Periods 25\u201338) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated demand regime and its volatility, balancing higher service level against holding cost given profit=$19 vs holding=$1.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

All concluded orders show actual lead time=0 historically, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the sustained higher demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (Periods 25\u201339, regime_length=15) so the OR engine bases base-stock on recent higher mean and volatility, improving service during the sustained uptick while holding cost is low relative to profit (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=147, in-transit=0. Observed sustained higher demand since Period 25 (confirmed in carry-over) with especially strong weeks from Period 32\u201340 (demands: 146,342,214,190,184,213,192,124,129). Promised and observed lead time historically = 0 in all conclude messages, so use default lead time. To capture the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 9 concluded weeks (Periods 32\u201340) \u2014 N=9 reflects the current sustained regime length and stays within the 3\u201320 rule. This increases target base stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility, balancing service level (profit $19) vs low holding cost $1.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand has been in an elevated regime since Period 25 (sustained uptick confirmed in history). To capture current high-demand regime I use recent_N=7 (last 7 demand samples reflect the post-uptick mean/volatility and balance service level vs holding cost). Keep L at default (promised lead time=0) since concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the most recent 7 periods to respond to the sustained uplift while limiting excess inventory given low holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has been elevated since the uptick starting Period 25 and especially in the last 10 weeks (Periods 33\u201342 mean \u2248192 units/week). On-hand=4, in-transit=0 so we need parameters that reflect the recent high-demand regime. Lead time has consistently concluded as 0 historically, so use default (promised) lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current high-demand regime (stable and sustained over many periods) so the OR backend will target a higher base stock while measuring volatility from the same recent window.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=273, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across many periods (no missing shipments), so keep L as promised (default). Demand has exhibited multiple regime shifts earlier in the year (major uptick from Period 25 and mid-year downshift around Period 8) but most recent 7 weeks (Periods 37\u201343) show higher and more variable demand (samples: 213,192,124,129,109,227,30) including a sudden drop in the last week; to be responsive to recent regime while smoothing noise I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=7 ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 7 samples). Use sigma_hat=default (std of all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)) so the OR backend captures long-run variability while the recent mean adjusts targeting. No evidence of lost shipments; parameters balance service (recent mean) vs holding cost (use backend q calculation and default sigma).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

On-hand=236, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and all concluded lead times = 0 historically. I choose default lead time to trust the promised 0 and use default demand estimates (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend uses full historical average/variance. This balances service (captures large historical spikes) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=199, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 (all concluded orders arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been variable with a one-off spike at Period 42 (227) but the last seven demands (Periods 39\u201345 = 124,129,109,227,30,54,59) average \u2248113.7; this recent window better reflects current winter/holiday demand volatility than the full-history mean. I select L=default to reflect observed 0-period actual lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 to focus the forecast and volatility estimate on the most recent regime, balancing service level (capture recent higher mean) against holding cost given sizable on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $986.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=154, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so use promised/default L=0. Recent demand (Periods 40\u201346: 129,109,227,30,54,59,60) shows a higher mean and clear volatility driven by a large 227 outlier; to capture the current regime I use a recent window of 7 periods for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend sets base-stock to cover the short-term elevated demand while accounting for variability. This balances high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) by targeting service vs holding using recent demand evidence.
