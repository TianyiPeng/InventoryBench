SKU is ladies high-waist skinny jeans \u2014 seasonal demand is moderate in late winter moving toward spring; no major holiday-specific spike expected, though apparel can see elevated purchases around mid-Feb sales. Historical demand shows a sharp upward trend through Jan\u2192early Feb 2019: 2019-01-07:0, 01-14:0, 01-21:56, 01-28:216, 02-04:319 \u2014 strong, recent growth. Demand regime analysis: last 3 observations (56,216,319) indicate a sustained upward regime; best estimate for current-period demand is near the most recent value (~319) or modestly higher. Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised LT=0 but no concluded arrivals yet to confirm; actual LT may be >=0 or shipments could be lost. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Given promised LT=0 (orders ideally arrive same period) we must cover current-period demand (L+1 periods =1). Inventory decision: balancing $19 profit per unit vs $1 holding cost favors filling expected demand; ordering slightly above the latest observed demand provides a small safety buffer for variability but avoids excessive holding cost. Action chosen to satisfy expected demand ~319 with a small buffer.",
