{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: concluded history and carry-over confirm actual lead time = 0 (orders historically arrived same period). Inventory: on-hand=87, in-transit=0; an order placed now will arrive in-period and can satisfy Period 47 demand. Demand view: recent weeks show high volatility\u2014large spike (Period 45 demand=115, Period 46=71) but also low weeks (9,13). Profit per unit ($19) far exceeds holding cost ($1), so the cost of a missed sale is much greater than the holding penalty. OR recommends 70 units (capped base-stock using promised L). Given confirmed L=0 and high upside risk of large demand, I follow OR's recommendation to replenish aggressively while staying within the OR cap. Final action: order 70 units to raise available stock to ~157 and capture potential high demand while accepting modest holding cost.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR's recommended 70 units\u2014lead time is confirmed 0 and profit ($19) >> holding cost ($1), so it's worthwhile to top up to cover potential high demand spikes (e.g., 115,71).",
