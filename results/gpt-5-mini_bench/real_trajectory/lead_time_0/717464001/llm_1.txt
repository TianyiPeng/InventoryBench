On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and supplier promised lead_time=0 but actual lead time is unknown (no concluded arrivals yet). Given the sustained higher demand (3+ weeks) and high unit profit ($19) versus low holding cost ($1/unit/period), target filling expected weekly demand while avoiding excessive overstock. Order 80 units to cover one week of expected demand (covers current period demand after decision plus provides stock if lead time is 0).
