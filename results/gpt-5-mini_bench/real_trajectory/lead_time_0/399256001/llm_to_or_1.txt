Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (240,251,252,269,354) show mean \u2248273 units/week and sample std \u224846. No prior orders or concluded arrivals to infer lead time or lost shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current demand. Use promised lead time (default L=0) because no observed lead-time evidence. Use default demand estimates based on all samples: mu_hat default -> (1+L)*mean captures expected demand this review+lead period; sigma_hat default -> sqrt(1+L)*std captures observed variability. These settings balance service (meet ~273 expected units) versus holding cost given limited evidence of regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Last concluded period shows an order placed in Period 1 arrived in-period (arrived=313, lead_time=0 confirmed). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly samples mean=273.2 and std from provided samples; Period 1 demand was 414 (a one-off spike vs. history). No sustained regime change (only one high demand period). Use default lead time (promised=0 confirmed) and default demand/volatility so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, preserving stability while the single spike is not yet a confirmed shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demand shows a spike vs Jan baseline (historical samples: 240,251,252,269,354; concluded recent demands: 414,399). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the now-higher demand. Lead times observed in concluded history are 0 periods (both P1 and P2 orders arrived same period). I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (confirming 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (last three realized demands: 2019-02-04=354, 2019-02-11=414, 2019-02-18=399) to be responsive to the recent upward regime while respecting the min-N=3 rule. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet elevated demand while keeping variance estimates focused on the latest regime.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-3) = [414, 399, 321], higher than historical Jan samples (mean ~273). On-hand=95, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Observed concluded lead times in P1-P3 are 0 periods, so use calculated lead time. I detect a sustained upward demand regime over the last 3 periods; use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets higher service while capping orders via its cap. This balances profit ($4) vs holding ($1) by reflecting the newer, higher mean and volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 1-3: avg increased from ~273 (historical Jan mean) to 378 (+38%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Reward (R_t): $814.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Promised LT=0 and concluded history (Periods1-4) shows actual lead time consistently 0 (orders placed in Pn arrived in same period). On-hand=174, in-transit=0. Recent demand has moderated after an earlier spike: concluded demands P2-P4 = 399, 321, 247; using a short recent window captures this downshift while remaining responsive. Set L=default to keep promised 0 (observed LT confirmed). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of most recent 3 samples, reflecting the recent decline. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture current volatility. These params steer the OR engine to lower base-stock than long-run mean, reducing overstock risk given falling demand while preserving service via updated uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $838.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed in Periods 1-5 all arrived same period). On-hand=142, in-transit=0; recent realized demand (Periods 3-5) = [321,247,245], recent mean \u2248271. Earlier carry-over noted a spike in Periods 1-3, but demand over the last 3 periods has reverted toward historical levels. To be responsive to the most recent regime while recognizing lead time = 0, I set L using observed lead times, and forecast demand using the last 3 periods (captures the recent decline). Sigma also uses the last 3 samples to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock tuned to current demand, avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service given same-period arrivals.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent demand has returned to ~250-320 after a brief high (Periods 1-3). On-hand=43, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected; no overdue shipments. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history, so keep L=default. To capture the current lower post-spike regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 4 demand samples (Periods 3-6) to reflect (1+L)\xd7current mean; set sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (q=0.8) vs holding by relying on the most recent stable regime rather than the earlier spike.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed. Historical concluded lead times = 0 in all observed periods \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Demand has shifted upward since Periods 1-3 and subsequent periods (Periods1-7) show higher weekly demand than the older Jan samples; to capture the recent elevated regime I use recent_N over the last 7 observed demand samples for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean and volatility from the most relevant data. This balances service (protects against stockouts given zero on-hand) while avoiding excessive holding given $1 holding cost by relying on recent demand statistics rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=94, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals (Periods 1-8) show actual lead time = 0 consistently, so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand (Periods 1-8 concluded sales: 313,357,321,247,245,265,300,283) indicates a higher mean than the older 2019 Jan samples; to capture the current regime and recent variability I use recent_N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases the base-stock on the last 8 observed demand periods. This keeps service high while the holding cost ($1) vs profit ($4) is moderate.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent realized lead times (Periods 1\u20139) are consistently 0 (arrivals recorded same period), so use promised lead time. On-hand=168, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Recent demand has softened vs. the early-period spike: last 5 demands (Periods 5\u20139) = [245,265,331,283,201], mean=265. Use a 5-period recent window to capture the latest regime (decline from the earlier spike) and avoid overweighting Jan samples. Choices: L=default to reflect observed 0 lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)*mean of last 5 periods \u2248265 units; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce ordering toward the earlier high-spike levels, balancing service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while limiting holding cost given current on-hand stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=176, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period; no overdue shipments. Recent demand (Periods 8-10 = 283, 201, 130) shows a sustained 3-period drop versus earlier weeks. To be responsive to this new lower regime while trusting observed zero lead time, I set L=default. For demand I target the most recent regime using recent_N (N=3) to capture the lower short-run mean (reduces overordering and holding cost). Sigma is set to recent_N (N=3) to reflect the lower recent volatility. These choices reduce base-stock and cap exposure to holding cost while keeping service given current on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 8-10: avg dropped from ~283 (Periods 4-7 recent prior avg ~281) to 204.7 (Periods 8-10) (-27.6%), sustained for 3 periods

Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand has declined: Periods 8-10 avg ~204.7 (sustained 3 periods) and Period 11 demand=173; on-hand=97, in-transit=0. Observed lead times in concluded history are all 0. I therefore set L via calculated observed lead times (0). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new lower regime (Periods 9-11), and sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce target base-stock to match the sustained drop and limit excess holding cost while preserving service for current demand.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has dropped vs earlier periods: last 3 concluded demands (P10-12 = 130, 173, 227) show a lower recent mean (~177) vs the earlier high regime. To avoid excess holding while preserving service, set L to the observed average (0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the base-stock to the most recent lower-demand regime and capture recent volatility; this reduces target inventory and holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders in P1\u2013P13 all concluded with lead_time 0), so use promised/default lead time. Demand has settled into the lower regime observed in Periods 8\u201313; to capture the recent lower mean I use a recent_N forecast over the last 3 demand periods (Periods 11\u201313) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This keeps target inventory tight to reduce holding cost while preserving service for the current lower-demand regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 (orders in P1\u2013P14 arrived same period), so use default promised L=0. Recent demand (Periods 12\u201314 = 227, 223, 251) averages ~233.7, indicating current regime ~234 units/week after the prior regime swings. I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to reflect the latest regime and avoid dilution from older, different regimes. I also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility (~15 units). These choices bias the OR backend toward stocking for the observed recent demand while limiting excess inventory given holding cost >0 and zero pipeline.

Recent demand (Periods 13-15: 223, 251, 267) suggests a stable recent regime with mean \u2248247; use a short recent window to reflect current pace and avoid overstock given holding cost. Selected L=default to trust observed 0-period lead time; mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to set (1+L)*mean based on last 3 periods; sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the current lower-demand regime and limit holding costs while preserving service.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Promised lead time historically observed as 0 in all concluded periods (orders arriving same period), so keep L=default. Recent demand (Periods 13-16 demands = 223,251,267,223) shows a stable recent regime with mean \u2248241 over 4 periods; use recent_N for mu_hat to focus the forecast on this recent regime. Volatility has also been lower recently; use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N=4 so the backend computes std over the same window. These choices keep target service high enough for current demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost = $1/unit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has softened vs earlier months (notable lower demands in Periods 15-17: 267, 223, 160). On-hand=100, in-transit=0. No evidence of lead-time deviation (all concluded orders show lead_time=0). I set L=default (promised 0) to keep OR backend\u2019s timing. For demand I use recent_N N=3 to capture the newest lower regime ((P15-P17) mean \u2248216.7 units for the review+lead period). For volatility I use recent_N N=3 to let the backend compute volatility from the same recent window. These choices reduce target base-stock to reflect the recent downward demand, limiting overstock and holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period fulfillment (observed lead_time=0 for all concluded orders). On-hand=122, in-transit=0. Demand has been subdued since the drop identified in prior carry-over insight (Periods 8-10 average ~204.7). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed operations and to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I use the default lead time (promised=0) and default demand/statistics so the engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This lets the OR engine apply its capped policy using full-sample estimates while respecting observed zero lead time and current low pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Promised lead time has consistently been 0 (observed arrivals always same-period). Use L default to keep promised lead time. Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) set from the most recent 3 periods to react to the sustained lower demand regime while keeping safety modest; this reduces overstock risk given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4. Recent_N=3 balances responsiveness and sample size.

Demand has been in a lower regime since Periods 8-10 and continued dropping recently (Periods 18-20 demands = 140, 113, 70). I choose recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the current low-demand regime (gives (1+L)*mean \u2248 107.7 units review+lead demand) so the OR backend targets lower replenishment and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service given current sales pace.

To be responsive to recent demand levels while limiting overstock, I use the promised/default lead time and base mu/sigma on recent observations (captures recent mean/volatility). This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to current demand without over-committing to old higher-demand regimes.

Recent demand has been in a lower regime versus early periods; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 19-23 = 113,70,99,155,160) show a lower mean and some volatility. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current low-demand regime and recent variance so the OR engine sets a smaller base-stock and tighter cap, reducing holding costs while preserving service for near-term demand.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=93, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 every period (orders arrived same period), so keep L=default (promised=0). Recent demand has dropped markedly starting Period 20: Periods 20-24 demands = [70,99,155,160,59], average 108.6 (5 periods) vs prior recent avg ~204.7 (Periods 8-10 / Periods 4-7 history), a sustained downward regime. To quickly adapt the forecast to the new lower regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the 5 most recent periods, (1+L)*mean of last 5). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect realized lower volatility. This keeps the OR backend focused on lower target inventory (reducing holding cost) while preserving service by sizing safety stock from recent variability. No evidence of lost shipments.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 20-24: avg dropped from ~204.7 to 108.6 (-47%), sustained for 5 periods

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 20 with a sustained drop; last 5 demand observations (Periods 22-26 = 155,160,59,90,131) reflect the current lower/volatile regime. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods, so keep promised lead time. Set L=default to respect promised lead time. Use mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the current regime mean (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples) and avoid overweighting older, higher-demand history. Use sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility for safety stock sizing. These choices keep service for the current lower-demand regime while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit/unit=$4.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent history shows the demand regime drop recorded through Period 20-24 (carry-over insights). Actual lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history. To keep stock aligned with the lowered recent demand regime, set L to promised (default=0) and use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to reflect the 5-period low-demand regime (Periods 20-24). This reduces target base-stock and caps excess holding given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages show actual lead time consistently 0 (all past orders arrived same period). Demand has experienced multiple regime shifts earlier (noted in carry-over) but no new sustained change in the last 3 periods; recent week demands (Periods 26-28) remain elevated versus the low around Periods 20-24. Given confirmed historical lead time=0 and no fresh sustained regime shift, use default estimators so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost with the profit/holding cost implied quantile.

Recent demand (Periods 25-29): 90,131,174,176,167 shows pickup from prior low regime; use a short recent-window forecast to reflect this new higher baseline while keeping lead time at promised (0). Selected L=default to trust promised lead time (no evidence of lost/delayed shipments). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=5 to capture the recent post-dip rebound and recent volatility so the OR engine raises target stock but avoids overcommitting inventory given holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand (Periods 27-30 = 174,176,167,197) shows a recovery to a new regime with mean \u2248178.5 over 4 weeks. All observed lead times in history are 0 periods, so keep promised lead time. To keep service without excess holding, set L=default (promised=0), set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to target the current elevated short-run mean, and set sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 to reflect current volatility. This balances profit (higher fill) versus holding cost given zero pipeline and the confirmed short recent regime.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-09-16 (Period 32). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=0 across all observed orders, so promised lead_time=0 remains valid. Demand shows a recent upward regime over Periods 29-31 (167,197,232) \u2014 I treat this as the new recent regime for forecasting. To respond quickly to the regained demand while limiting holding cost, I set L=default to keep lead time at promised 0, use mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent higher mean across the review+lead horizon, and set sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent variability. This biases orders toward meeting the recent higher demand while the short lead time keeps pipeline small, balancing service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29-31: avg increased from ~108.6 to 198 (+82%), sustained for 3 periods (demands: 167,197,232).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=32, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand regime (Periods 29-32) is elevated vs prior low regime: demands = [167,197,232,195], recent average ~198. No overdue or missing shipments to reconcile. I set L=default (promised 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the latest elevated regime ((1+L)\xd7mean \u2248197.8). Sigma also uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock focused on the current higher-demand regime while respecting the confirmed zero lead time and avoiding excess inventory given holding cost.

Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the recent uptick (protect service during this renewed higher-demand regime).

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Recent demand (P31-35 = 232,195,317,259,218) avg \u2248244; no evidence of new sustained regime shift since Period 32. Promised lead time historically observed as 0. To keep service while limiting holding cost, use default lead time (promised=0) and set demand forecast and volatility from the most recent 5 periods to capture current regime. This balances responsiveness to the recent higher-demand regime vs. holding costs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demands show a sustained upswing since Period 32: demands P32-36 = [195,317,259,218,236], mean=245. On-hand=48, in-transit=0 \u2192 current stock is far below expected (next-period) demand. Historical lead time has consistently been 0 (concluded arrivals always same-period), so keep promised lead time. I detect a recent demand regime starting Period 32; I use recent_N=5 to capture the new higher mean/volatility (regime length 5). This raises mu_hat to cover (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat to reflect recent variability, which helps the OR backend compute a higher base stock to avoid stockouts while the cap limits extreme orders. No evidence of lost shipments, so no explicit lead-time extension.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32-36: avg increased from ~198 (Periods 29-31/previous regime) to 245 (Periods 32-36) (+24%), sustained for 5 periods

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=49, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows elevated regime since Period 32; last 5 demands (P33-37) = [317,259,218,236,236], mean\u2248253, std elevated. No concluded late/missing arrivals (all prior lead times observed=0). I set L=default to trust promised 0 (no evidence to increase). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current higher-demand regime (1+L factor applied by backend). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine to target a base-stock aligned to the recent higher mean while sizing safety stock to observed short-term variance; with on-hand=49 and no pipeline, this will prompt replenishment to cover the current-period demand and safety buffer while avoiding excessive holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand (Periods 33-38 = 317,259,218,236,236,197) averages ~244, indicating the most recent regime persists. On-hand=89, in-transit=0; promised lead time has historically been 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). I set L=default to trust the promised lead time. To match the current high-regime demand while limiting holding cost, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (captures the latest sustained regime of ~244 mean and its volatility) so the OR backend computes base_stock for L=0 from the recent mean and std. This balances service level for current demand without inflating inventory from older regimes.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=57, In-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 every period (orders always arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 36-39 = 236,236,197,222) shows no new sustained regime change beyond previously recorded shifts. To avoid overstock given holding cost and no pipeline, use default demand/volatility inputs so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples. This yields an order target that balances service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while not assuming unobserved lead-time drift or transient spikes.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demands (Periods 36-40 = 236,236,197,222,220) show a stable regime around ~222 units/week after the elevated mid-Sep/Oct spike. All observed lead times have been 0 historically. I choose L=default to keep promised 0 (no evidence of lead-time drift). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast on the current regime (reduces influence of older higher/lower regimes). Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to capture current volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned with the recent realized demand, limiting holding cost while maintaining service for the current demand level.

I expect elevated demand into early Dec but with high uncertainty. All observed lead times have been 0, so keep promised lead time. Use recent_N (last 5 weeks) to capture the upward movement while limiting influence of older regimes; apply the same recent_N window for sigma to capture realized volatility including the spike. This balances service (avoid stockouts for the holiday surge) against holding cost by basing base-stock on recent empirical mean and variance.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=179, in-transit=0. Historical observed lead times all 0 periods -> use default lead time. Recent demand shows a large one-week spike (Period 42 demand=467) but the last 5 periods (P39-43 demands = 222,220,209,467,181) yield a moderate elevated mean (~260) and elevated variance. I choose L=default to reflect observed 0 lead time; mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to adapt to the recent elevated mean while smoothing the single large spike; sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward a higher base-stock than long-run average to avoid stockouts around the recent peak while keeping holding cost in check by limiting the window to 5 periods.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent sales show elevated but volatile demand: last 7 demands = [197,222,220,209,467,181,205] with a single large spike (467) on Period 42 (likely one-off holiday bump). On-hand=154, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I use default lead time (promised 0, historically observed 0). To balance service vs holding given recent volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (using the most recent 5 demand observations to capture the near-term regime while limiting influence of the single large spike). This gives the OR engine a short-term forecast that responds to recent elevated demand without overreacting to the single outlier, helping maintain service while controlling holding costs.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Promised lead time = 0 and historical conclude messages show consistent 0-period arrivals (no evidence of delayed or lost shipments). Recent week-level demand shows elevated volumes around late Nov/Dec (Period 42 spike then sustained higher weekly demand P43-P45). I choose L=default to trust promised lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime through the holiday window, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (using the last 5 demand samples: Periods 41-45) so the OR backend targets a higher base-stock reflecting current demand while keeping variability measured over the same recent window. This balances service during the holiday lift versus holding costs; no in-transit units exist so orders will immediately affect same-period availability under lead time 0.

Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect the short-run mean across the review+lead period. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to let the OR engine size safety stock to recent volatility.
