  "rationale": "Observed actual lead time = 0 in all concluded periods (orders arrive same period), so an order placed now will arrive for Period 47 demand. Recent demand (Periods 43\u201346) = 41, 45, 64, 55 \u2192 recent avg \u2248 51.3; including the 101 spike at P42 (likely promotional) would unduly inflate the mean. Profit = holding cost \u2192 critical fractile 0.5 so target \u2248 mean demand. OR recommended 71 (uses long-run history and promised lead time); I reduce toward recent demand to avoid excess holding cost at year-end. With on-hand=5, order = round(max(0, recent_mean \u2212 on_hand)) \u2248 51.3 \u2212 5 \u2248 46.3; I choose 50 units to be slightly conservative for potential year-end traffic while limiting holding cost.",
