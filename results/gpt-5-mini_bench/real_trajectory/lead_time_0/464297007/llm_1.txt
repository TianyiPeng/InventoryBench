  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Period date is 2019-02-11 (mid-February). No major holiday spike this week (Valentine's is 2019-02-14 but underwear demand may increase slightly around that date). Product is everyday women's underwear (steady baseline demand). b) Demand analysis: historical weekly demand for SKU: 2019-01-07:267; 01-14:298; 01-21:307; 01-28:189; 02-04:122. Recent trend shows a sharp downshift in late Jan\u2192early Feb; last sample 122 suggests demand has softened. c) Lead time / pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. Supplier promised lead time = 0 but actual lead time unknown; no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Conservatively assume at least 1-period effective lead time (so orders placed now will not be available before current period demand). d) Inventory strategy: Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit), so excess inventory is very costly. To balance service and holding cost, aim to match near-term expected demand and avoid large safety stock. Using recent downward trend, target a modest order sized close to the most recent observed demand (122) to cover expected demand while limiting holding risk; order rounded to 120 units. e) Final decision: Place order of 120 units to cover anticipated near-term demand while observing arrivals to infer lead time and update future orders.",

Lead-time evidence: one concluded arrival shows supplier can deliver with 0 periods lead time (order arrives same period). Forecast/demand reasoning: recent realized demand points for Feb are 122 (2019-02-04) and 159 (2019-02-11); a simple near-term demand forecast for Period2 is roughly 130\u2013150 units. Cost tradeoff: profit per unit = $1, holding cost per unit per period = $1, so overstock is very costly; marginal unit should be ordered only if >=~50% chance of being sold. Action choice: aim to cover expected period demand while avoiding excess. I choose a conservative order of 140 units to supply Period2 demand without large expected ending inventory.",
