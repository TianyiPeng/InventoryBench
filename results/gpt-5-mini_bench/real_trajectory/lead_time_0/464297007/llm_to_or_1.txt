Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 464297007 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demands: [267,298,307,189,122]. Recent three weeks show a lower regime (307,189,122) vs full-sample mean (236.6); I choose to down-weight older weeks. Use promised lead time (default) since no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Set mu_hat based on recent_N=3 to capture the newer lower mean and reduce over-ordering. Set sigma_hat recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding so target service quantile is moderate; using recent samples helps avoid excess inventory after the observed drop in demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected ending 2019-02-04: full-sample avg=236.6, recent-3 avg=206 (-12.9%), recent three weeks show sustained lower demand (307,189,122).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand has shifted down vs full-sample (prior carry-over noted lower recent 3-week avg ~206). On-hand=47, in-transit=0; no arrivals expected before next decision. I keep L at promised (default) because observed lead_time=0 (Period1 arrival was same-period). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed lower recent regime and avoid over-ordering. sigma_hat uses default (full-sample) since volatility evidence is limited.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders from P1 and P2 arrived same period). Demand history shows a downshift: recent-3 weeks mean = 206 (307,189,122). To protect service with low holding cost parity (profit=holding), set L by observed lead times and forecast demand using the recent regime. Chosen: L=calculate to use observed 0-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture the recent lower-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep base-stock focused on the new lower mean while using recent volatility for safety given tight profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand has declined (recent-3 weeks: 307,189,122) vs full-sample mean 236.6; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times are 0 in all past periods, so set L to calculate to confirm average observed lead time=0. To react to the recent lower demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures the most recent regime). This reduces target base-stock to reflect lower demand and lowers variability estimate, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11): on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead_time=0 (orders in P1\u2013P4 all arrived with W=0). Recent demand shows a downward shift (last 3 samples: 307,189,122) vs full-sample mean. To be responsive to the recent lower regime while using confirmed lead time, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent regime and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstock risk given holding cost equals profit and no pipeline inventory.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for all observed orders. Recent demand shows a downward regime vs. full-sample (recent 3 weeks: 307,189,122 \u2192 lower mean). On-hand=68, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the recent lower-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target base-stock lower to avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding cost and observed demand drop.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). History shows observed lead_time=0 in all concluded periods. Recent demand has trended down (Period 1 carry-over noted): last 3 sample demands = 307,189,122 showing a sustained lower regime. On-hand=61, in-transit=0; to avoid overstock given equal profit and holding cost, use a short-horizon recent estimate. Set L to default (promised=0). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the new lower-demand regime and reduced volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 in every conclude message (orders placed in Periods 1\u20137 arrived same period), so promised 0 is supported. Recent demand (Periods 5\u20137 = 250,216,253) is lower than earlier peaks; I use a short recent window to capture the current regime. Set L to promised (default 0), mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 demand observations to reflect the recent lower/stable demand and reduce excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders in Periods 1-8 arrived same period). Recent demand has been centered above 200 in the latest 5 periods, so I focus the forecast on the most recent regime to avoid bias from earlier low weeks. Set L to calculated (observed lead times average). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current mean and volatility over the latest 5 demand observations. This yields a base-stock tuned to recent demand while reflecting low holding cost equal to profit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand (Periods 5-9 = 250,216,253,283,176) shows a lower/stabilized regime versus earlier full-sample average; all observed lead times in concludes = 0. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time=0 from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime (mean \u2248235.6 units for review+lead period) and reduce influence of earlier higher/outlier weeks. Sigma uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base_stock aligned with current demand while avoiding overstock from older high-demand weeks; they also rely on confirmed lead-time=0 so orders can replenish within the same period.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show all observed arrivals had lead_time=0 consistently; no lost shipments. Recent demand is variable but no new sustained regime change since the previously noted drop through 2019-02-04. Use promised lead time (default) and full-sample demand statistics so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock and cap calculations robustly without overfitting to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. All concluded lead times = 0 (orders arriving same period), so keep L as default (promised lead time). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: 253,283,176,169,176) shows a moderate downward shift from earlier highs but no new sustained regime beyond these 5 weeks; use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus forecast on current demand. Use default sigma_hat to let backend compute volatility from full sample scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (capture recent demand level) against holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5 -> neutral z).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: 283,176,169,176,323) is volatile with no evidence of a new sustained regime beyond earlier noted dip. All concluded deliveries show lead_time=0 consistently. To keep the forecast responsive to current demand while respecting confirmed lead time, I use calculated lead time (observed avg=0) and recent-5 demand for mean and volatility so the OR backend targets service while limiting holding costs.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent concluded history shows all observed lead_times = 0 (orders placed previously all arrived same period), so actual lead time confirmed as 0. On-hand = 104, in-transit = 0; no overdue shipments. Demand has shifted lower vs. the early-sample mean; I use recent 5-week data to capture current regime (Periods 9\u201313 demands = 176,169,176,323,122; recent-5 mean \u2248193) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on recent_N=5 so the OR backend targets a base-stock matching the current demand level while keeping safety stock tuned to recent volatility. Using calculate for L ensures backend uses observed lead time history (0) rather than the promised default, avoiding excess pipeline orders given no transit.

Recent demand shows a downward shift vs full-sample (carry-over noted: recent-3 avg=206 vs full-sample 236.6). To reflect the confirmed 0 lead time and respond to the recent lower demand regime, I use calculated lead time (avg observed = 0) and base mu/sigma on the most recent 3 weeks to adapt to the new regime while keeping variability responsive.

Use default lead time to trust promised L=0; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7full-sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7full-sample std, preserving historical demand signal and letting OR engine set safety stock based on profit/holding tradeoff.

Recent demand (Periods 13-17: 122,151,171,200,154) shows no new sustained regime change beyond the previously recorded Feb shift. Given stable recent behavior and confirmed lead time=0, use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7full-sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7full-sample std). This balances service level and holding cost without overreacting to short fluctuations.

Recent demand (Periods 14-18 = 151,171,200,154,281) shows higher variability vs the early-Feb lower regime; to react to the most recent demand pattern I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility. Keep L as default (promised 0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. This provides the OR engine a (1+L)-scaled recent mean to target service while sigma based on the same recent window captures current volatility and avoids overcommitting inventory.

Demand history shows variability including one large spike (Period 19: 556) but no sustained regime change since the previously recorded early-February dip; therefore use full-sample defaults for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std. Default settings balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1 -> q=0.5, z*=0).

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-07-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0, so use default promised lead time. Recent demand (Periods 17-20 = 154,281,556,261) shows a higher short-term average vs. the full-sample; no new 3+ period sustained regime change beyond natural volatility, but the last 4 weeks average (~313) is the best short-term forecast for the next (1+L) review+lead window. To keep the OR base-stock aligned with current demand while avoiding excessive holding (profit=holding => target service q=0.5), I use a recent-4 mean and recent-4 std for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend responds to the recent uplift without over-committing long-term inventory.

Historical conclude messages (Periods 1\u201321) show all arrivals occurred with lead_time=0 (orders arrived same period), so I accept promised lead time=0. Recent demand is volatile (including a large spike Period 19) but no sustained multi-period regime change since the prior documented insight. Given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1) I choose the backend defaults so base-stock uses full-sample mean and std (captures long-run demand and volatility) while keeping L as promised to avoid over-adjusting for one-off spikes. This balances service level (by using full-sample demand estimates) against holding cost sensitivity.

Recent demand (Periods 19-22: 556,261,201,341) shows elevated and volatile demand vs. earlier winter samples; to adapt quickly I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to capture the most recent regime. Chosen N=5 balances reactivity and sample size. These parameters let the OR backend raise the base-stock to meet higher recent demand while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given equal profit/holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover immediate demand. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 (orders always arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 21-23 = 201, 341, 422) shows a sustained higher level in the last three weeks compared with earlier weeks, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the most relevant short-term demand and volatility. This biases ordering toward meeting the current elevated demand while the backend caps and service-level logic will limit excessive orders given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=187, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time=0 consistently. Recent demand shows a lower regime (noted earlier) \u2014 use recent 3-week mean to capture current lower demand. Choose L=default (promised 0). mu_hat use recent_N N=3 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on most recent regime. sigma_hat use default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7full-sample std) to avoid overfitting short-run volatility. These parameters keep target inventory aligned to recent demand while limiting holding given profit=holding.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=167, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically (consistent). Recent demand shows a modest downshift from early periods but last three observed demands (Periods 23-25 = 422,135,133) indicate a recent mean around 230; I use a short recent window to capture this recent regime while keeping lead time at promised value. Choices: L=default to reflect stable observed lead_time=0; mu_hat=recent_N (N=3) to set (1+L)*mean of last 3 samples and keep base-stock responsive to recent demand; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility and avoid overstock given equal profit/holding costs (q=0.5 implies moderate service target). This balances service level versus holding cost given current on-hand and no in-transit units.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all past concluded orders show lead_time=0). Recent demand has been volatile; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 22-26) = [341, 422, 135, 133, 339], suggesting a recent mean ~274 with elevated variability. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (0) because concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the OR backend target the recent regime and react to the latest volatility; this balances service (capture current elevated mean) against holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1) which implies neutral fill-level (q=0.5). Using recent_N focuses orders on the most relevant recent demand pattern and avoids diluting with older data that include a prior lower regime.

Promised lead time historically observed as 0 in concluded history, so keep L=default. Set mu_hat to recent_N with N=10 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the latest ten demand observations (captures recent spikes while smoothing older lower-demand weeks). Set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility for safety stock sizing. This balances service (capture recent high demand) vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=192, in-transit=0. Recent 3-week demand (Periods 26-28 = 339, 243, 100) shows a moderate recent average (~227) and elevated variability versus the small January sample; no evidence of lost shipments (all past orders concluded, lead time observed=0 historically). I choose L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (consistent recent concluded arrivals). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to adapt to the current short-term demand regime (capture last 3 weeks' mean and volatility). This keeps the base-stock responsive to recent demand while limiting holding cost given profit=holding cost parity.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=104, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has been below earlier peaks (last 5 demands: 133,339,243,100,124; recent mean ~187.8) so I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to reflect current regime and reduce overstock risk; sigma also estimated from recent 5 samples to capture current volatility. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward current demand and limit holding cost given profit=holding.

Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=120, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (all prior 'arrived' messages show lead_time=0). Recent demand is volatile with several large spikes (e.g., Periods 33\u201334 demand 692 and 335) so I rely on the most recent regime rather than the original small-sample Jan data. Set L to default (promised 0). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture current mean over the last 5 weeks and reflect recent volatility; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so the backend estimates safety stock from recent variability. This balances service (responding to recent high spikes) against holding cost given current on-hand stock of 120 and zero pipeline.

Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). On-hand=185, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across all periods (no evidence of lost/delayed shipments). Demand history is variable with occasional spikes but no newly confirmed sustained regime shift since prior insight. I choose default lead time to trust the promised L=0, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR engine uses full-sample mean and std (scaled by 1+L) to compute base-stock and cap. This keeps parameters stable given mixed recent demand and avoids overfitting short spikes while the on-hand balance (185) provides coverage for near-term demand.

Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=113, in-transit=0. All concluded orders show actual lead time = 0 (orders in history arrived same period), so use default promised lead time. No new sustained demand regime change since prior insight; use default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample. This keeps the base-stock policy aligned with observed zero lead time and historical demand while avoiding overfitting short-term noise.

Recent demand has shifted down vs. early sample; to capture the most recent regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current weeks (reduces overstock risk while preserving service). These parameters keep the base-stock tied to recent demand, lowering holding cost given current moderate demand and zero observed lead time.

Historical concluded lead times have been 0 (orders arriving same period), and no new sustained demand regime change detected since prior insight. Profit=Holding so critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0) => base stock=mu_hat.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in history show arrived same period), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows elevated and volatile sales in the last 5 weeks (periods 36-40 demands = 100,124,115,241,387) suggesting a recent regime with higher mean and variance; I use recent_N=5 to capture this shift so the OR engine raises the base-stock to meet short-term higher demand while avoiding overcommitment to an older low-demand regime.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period), so use promised lead time. Recent demand (last several months) shows higher variability and frequent stockouts; to capture the recent regime and avoid understocking ahead of Black Friday/holiday season, I use recent_N (most recent 20 weeks) for both demand mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects the latest demand level and higher variance. This balances service (avoid lost sales during peak) against holding cost by letting the OR backend compute z* from profit vs. holding and apply the capped order cap.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 each period, so keep L as promised (default). Recent 4-week demand (Periods 39-42 = 241, 387, 348, 311) is a sustained higher regime vs. prior full-sample mean; use a recent_N forecast to raise the (1+L)\xd7mean used by the OR engine while keeping volatility estimated from the same recent window to capture elevated variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent surge) against holding cost by targeting recent demand rather than full-sample average.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39: recent-4 avg=321.75 vs full-sample avg\u2248236.6 (+35.9%), sustained for 4 periods (Periods 39-42).

Recent demand has shown variability with earlier documented regime shifts; no new sustained changepoint in the last concluded period (Period 43 demand=266) to justify changing the forecast method. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend treats L=0; use full-sample defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, preserving the documented regime insights for future periods and avoiding overfitting to a single recent week.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0) so use default promised lead time. Recent demand since Period 39 is materially higher and sustained (Periods 39-44 demands = 241,387,348,311,266,380; recent-6 mean \u2248322), indicating a higher-demand regime vs full-sample. I select mu_hat using recent_N with N=6 to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and capture the current regime. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the backend base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma captures variability for safety stock; default L avoids overestimating lead time given consistent observed 0 lead-time concludes.

Promised lead time history shows consistent 0-period actual lead time. To respond to the sustained elevated demand I use the recent-8 demand estimates so the OR backend raises base_stock to cover the new regime while keeping L at promised (default).
