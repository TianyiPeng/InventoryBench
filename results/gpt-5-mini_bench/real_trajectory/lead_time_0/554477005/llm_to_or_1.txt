Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). Historical weekly samples available (20,26,22,27,15) with no clear recent changepoint and no seasonal event this week. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded lead times: Period1=0, Period2=0 \u2192 actual lead time inferred as 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand was 19 then 41 but only one high-demand period\u2014no sustained regime change. Use lead-time average to reflect observed 0; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat at defaults so backend uses full-sample statistics adjusted for (1+L). This balances service vs. holding cost without overreacting to a single high-demand week. No evidence of lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows demands: P1=19, P2=41, P3=41 and all observed lead_times = 0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so next order must cover current + lead period. I set L=calculate to use the average of observed lead times (all 0). Demand shows a clear uptick versus older Jan samples, so I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the three most recent concluded demands. This ensures the OR backend targets service for the elevated recent demand while keeping holding risk tied to recent variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $20.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent realized lead times (Periods 1-4) all arrived same period (lead_time=0), so use calculated average lead time. Historical Jan samples show mean ~22, but demand since Period 2 is higher (Period2-4 demands = 41,41,27), indicating a sustained upward regime; therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3 demand samples to capture the new level/volatility. Current on-hand=7, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Parameters chosen raise target inventory to cover (1+L) review+lead demand under the new regime while keeping holding risk controlled by using recent volatility estimate.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 2: avg weekly demand increased from 22 (Jan sample mean) to 36.33 (Periods 2-4 mean = 41,41,27; +65.15%)

Daily Reward (R_t): $27.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history shows persistent higher demand since Period 2 (demands: P1=19, P2=41, P3=41, P4=27, P5=32) and all observed lead times = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). Current on-hand=5, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. I treat lead time as the observed average (calculate) = 0. For demand I focus on the recent higher-demand regime (Periods 2-5); I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 (Periods 2-5) to capture the regime mean across the review+lead period, and sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to match the new demand level while keeping variability estimates tied to the recent regime, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost (q\u22480.5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent sales (Periods 2-6 = 41,41,27,32,36) show a sustained higher-demand regime vs. the Jan baseline. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current demand. Set L=default to use promised (0) since observed lead_time=0 across concluded periods. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated recent mean/volatility (focus on Periods 2-6) so the base-stock reflects the new regime and avoids understocking while holding cost equals profit.

Daily Reward (R_t): $36.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded history shows consistently zero actual lead time (all concluded arrivals: lead_time=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Demand has shifted up starting Period 2 (sustained higher weekly demand: many weeks in 30s\u201350s). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) because concluded messages confirm lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (Periods 2\u20137 demand = 41,41,27,32,36,53; N=6) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of those 6 most recent samples. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 so variability is estimated from the same recent regime. These choices bias orders toward the new higher demand while keeping holding cost in check by using the confirmed lead time.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Observed concluded lead times across history are consistently 0 \u2192 use calculate to let backend set L=0. Historical demand shows a sustained upward regime beginning Period 2; I focus forecasting on the recent regime (Periods 2\u20138, 7 samples) to capture elevated mean and volatility. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7 to make the base-stock responsive to the higher recent demand while limiting influence of the small pre-shift Jan sample.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (observed in Periods 1-9), so use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Demand shows a clear recent uptick; use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 5-9 demands = 32,36,53,85,77) to capture the new higher regime for both mean and volatility. N=5 chosen because the changepoint to higher demand is sustained and the last 5 periods represent the new regime. These parameters raise the (1+L)-period demand forecast and variance to improve service during the sustained higher-demand regime while the OR backend will cap orders per its cap rule.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): recent demand has surged since Period 2 with multiple high weeks (Periods 7-10 notably 53,85,77,129). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover immediate demand. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 0, so set L by calculate (avg observed = 0). To capture the sustained post-changepoint higher demand, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 9 samples (captures Periods 2-10 after the identified shift). Volatility also increased; use sigma_hat recent_N with N=9 to reflect recent variability. These choices increase the base stock to protect service level during the sustained higher-demand regime while sigma_hat raises safety stock to balance holding cost vs stockouts.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in Periods 1\u201311 all arrived same period). Demand has experienced a sustained, large upward shift since Period 2 with elevated weekly demand through Period 11. To capture the new regime, set lead time to default (promised=0) and use recent_N=10 for demand mean and volatility so the OR backend bases base_stock on the last 10 observed demands (Periods 2\u201311), balancing service against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in Periods 1\u201312 all arrived same period). Demand jumped starting Period 2 and has remained elevated (use recent regime from Period 2 onward). Choose L by calculating average observed lead time to reflect confirmed 0 actual lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 2\u201312, N=11) so the base-stock reflects the higher sustained demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=11 to capture current volatility. These choices keep service high for the sustained higher demand while avoiding inflated safety stock from older low-demand samples. No overdue or lost shipments detected.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Lead-time history shows consistent same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 for all concluded orders), so use promised/default lead time. Demand shifted up starting Period 2 and has remained elevated through Period 13 (Periods 2\u201313 demand sample count=12; recent mean >> initial Jan sample). I therefore use recent_N with N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base_stock on the current high-demand regime. On-hand and in-transit are zero, no overdue or lost shipments detected; parameters aim to raise target inventory to meet the sustained higher demand while letting the backend cap limit moderate order size.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 2 with especially large weekly demand from Period 7 onward (periods 7-14: 53,85,77,129,184,111,79,83). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead demand. All concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 consistently; use calculate to reflect observed average. For demand I use a recent_N window covering the identified high-demand regime (N=8, Periods 7-14) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and variability; this raises base_stock to reduce lost sales while capped ordering will limit overstock given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27. Recent weeks show a sustained, large upward demand regime versus Jan baseline (many weeks of 50\u2013184 units; last 9 weeks demand: 53,85,77,129,184,111,79,83,122). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for the higher recent demand. Actual observed lead time has consistently been 0 in concluded history, so use default promised lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime and recent volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (captures the most recent weeks while respecting the detected regime). This increases forecasted base stock and safety stock to reduce stockouts while accepting higher holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders arrived same period). Demand has clearly shifted up and is sustained: last 10 periods (P7\u2013P16) demands = [53,85,77,129,184,111,79,83,122,172], mean = 109.5 units/week \u2014 well above earlier regime. I therefore keep L as default (promised = 0) since concluded data confirm 0 lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the new high-demand regime (N chosen = 10 = length of recent sustained high-demand run). I also use recent_N N=10 for sigma to reflect elevated variability in the same window. These choices raise the base_stock to cover the sustained higher mean while measuring higher volatility so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 each period so use default promised lead time. Demand has clearly shifted up since Period 2 and sustained high weekly sales across many recent weeks; use recent sample window to capture the new regime. I select recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base (1+L)-period demand and volatility on the most recent 15 weeks, which balances responsiveness to the sustained higher demand while smoothing week-to-week noise. These parameters will raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while the capped order limit prevents extreme single-period orders and controls holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concluded history (Periods 1-18) shows consistently large and increasing weekly demand with all observed lead times = 0 and current on-hand=0, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). I choose L by 'calculate' (average of observed lead times = 0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I select 'default' so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples \u2014 this leverages the full observed demand history including the sustained higher-demand regime. These settings balance service (capture elevated mean demand) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute the profit/holding-driven safety stock.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Historical concluded lead times = 0 consistently (Periods 1-19). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 2 (sustained elevated weekly demand through Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must target the new higher-demand regime. Set L=default to trust promised lead time (observations confirm 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N over the recent high-demand regime (N=18, Periods 2-19) so the base-stock reflects current elevated mean. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N=18 to capture current variability. This balances service (cover higher demand) and holding cost by using regime-specific estimates rather than diluted long-ago low demand.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 for all observed orders and a sustained demand regime shift upward starting at Period 2 (early low Jan samples vs. consistently higher demand from Periods 2\u201320). On-hand and in-transit are 0, so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods of expected demand. I set L to calculate to let backend confirm observed average lead time (which is 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 2\u201320 form the new regime; regime_length=19) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent average demand across the review+lead period. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=19 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (capture the sustained higher demand) while using recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost equals profit.

Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 (all conclude messages show lead_time=0), so keep L as promised (default). There is a sustained demand regime shift beginning at Period 2: weekly demand rose sharply versus the Jan seed samples. To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N for both demand mean and volatility, using the most recent 20 observed demand periods (capped at 20) so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 20) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(last 20). This raises the base-stock to meet the higher demand while the cap prevents extreme single-period over-ordering. No evidence of lost shipments to adjust lead time is present.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. Recent weeks show a sustained higher demand regime vs. Jan samples (large, consistent weekly sales since Period 7). On-hand=6, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; no overdue shipments observed (historical concluded lead times all 0). I set L=default to use promised lead time (observed lead times have consistently been 0). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the elevated recent mean (last 7 weeks) so mu_hat reflects current high-demand regime and avoids being pulled down by low January samples. I also use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock to reduce stockouts during the sustained high-demand period while keeping variance estimate aligned to recent variability to limit excess holding.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. On-hand=23, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so keep L as promised (0). Demand shows a sustained upward regime since Period 7 (many weekly demands >> Jan samples); use recent data to forecast. Set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the post-changepoint higher mean (reduces stockouts vs using full-sample mean). Set sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect current volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost by only using the recent regime rather than the low Jan baseline.

Use promised/default lead time to align with observed deliveries and let OR backend compute demand mean/variance from full history (balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding cost).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=38, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 in all observed periods. Demand rose sharply after Period 1 and has been at a higher regime for many periods; to capture the sustained elevated demand I use recent_N based estimates over the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the post-changepoint regime). L set to calculated average of observed lead times (observed=0). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat biases the base-stock toward current demand levels and recent volatility so the OR backend replenishes to meet higher demand while limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. Recent weekly demand has fallen from the mid-hundreds in early summer to ~56\u2013144 in the last four weeks (Period 24\u201327 demands = 144,94,56,63). On-hand = 65, in-transit = 0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep L=default. To adapt to the recent downshift, set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (focus (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 weeks). Use recent_N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce target base stock to match the cooler recent demand, lowering holding cost while keeping service level aligned with recent demand variability.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=45, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments visible. Recent demand has softened from mid-summer peaks \u2014 last 5 concluded weekly demands (Periods 24-28) = [144,94,56,63,45], mean=80.4, sample std\u224835.7. Promised lead time historically observed = 0 consistently. To balance service vs holding cost (profit=holding=$1), I use a short recent-window forecast to reflect the post-peak decline: set L to default (promised 0), set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 5 weeks (captures the new lower regime), and set sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 5 weeks to reflect current volatility. This keeps target base-stock tied to the recent realized demand while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=43, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 2 (much larger weekly sales than Jan samples) but no new sustained changepoint since the previously recorded insight. No shipments are overdue. Set L by calculating average observed lead time (will be 0). Use default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean_of_all_samples and sqrt(1+L)*std_of_all_samples \u2014 this leverages the full historical sample set to smooth variability while the OR engine applies the profit/holding tradeoff internally.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show promised lead time=0 consistently. Demand spiked mid-year then has trended lower in Aug\u2013early Sep (Periods 21\u201330: 147,146,109,144,94,56,63,45,38,34). To reflect current reduced demand while retaining responsiveness to recent volatility, I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 10 weeks, capturing the recent downshift and variance. This keeps target base-stock aligned to near-term demand and avoids excess holding cost given on-hand=55 and no pipeline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=56, in-transit=0. Historical lead times observed consistently 0 (no missing shipments), so use default promised L=0. Recent demand has settled well below earlier peak; last 6 weeks demand = [56,63,45,38,34,32] (mean\u224844.7). To align ordering with the current lower-demand regime and reduce holding cost, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (captures latest regime while meeting N bounds). This reduces excess stock while maintaining service given profit=holding cost parity.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has declined from mid-year peaks to ~25\u201345/week; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 28\u201332) = [45,38,34,32,25], recent mean \u224834.8. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0; no evidence to change promised lead time. To balance service vs holding (profit=holding), I use a short-term recent demand estimate: set L=default (promised 0), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent lower-demand regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps target stock aligned to current consumption and avoids excess holdings after summer peaks.

Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 historically, so keep L=default. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent lower-demand regime and reduced volatility, which will lower the OR base-stock and limit holding cost while still covering near-term demand.

Demand has fallen from summer peaks; recent five-week demand (Periods 30-34) = [34,32,25,31,15], avg \u224827.4, showing a lower recent regime. Use promised/default lead time to match observed history. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets current lower demand and reduces excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/21. On-hand=5, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically; use calculate to confirm actual lead time=0. Recent 5-week demand (Periods 32-36 = 25,31,15,11,18) is substantially lower and less volatile than earlier months, so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime and reduce overstock risk given profit=holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=6, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show every observed order arrived the same period (all recorded lead_time=0), so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. Demand history includes earlier sustained high regime (already recorded). To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and full-sample demand statistics I set L via calculate (avg observed lead times = 0) and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all demand samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding (q=0.5) and no evidence of new sustained changepoint.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=64, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 keep promised lead time. Recent demand has fallen since Period 32 (demands P32\u2013P38 = [25,31,15,11,18,14,12], mean=18 over last 7 weeks) indicating a new low-demand regime; to avoid excess inventory I base forecasts on the most recent 7 weeks. Chosen methods: L=default to reflect observed 0-period lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=7 to use (1+L)*mean of last 7 samples (captures the recent downshift); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce over-ordering given high holding cost and current ample on-hand stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. Recent demand has trended down from mid-year peaks; last 8 weekly demands (Periods 32-39) are low and stable (range ~7\u201325, recent mean ~12\u201340% of peak). On-hand=57, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. I keep L as promised (0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to reflect the new low-demand regime (use the last 8 weeks to avoid overreacting to single-week noise). This reduces target base-stock to match current demand and lowers holding risk while preserving service for immediate weeks.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are all 0 \u2192 use default promised lead time. Demand has clearly shifted down starting Period 32 (sustained low sales over 9 weeks); to capture the current regime I set demand forecast using recent samples. Chosen methods: L=default to trust promised 0; mu_hat=recent_N with N=9 (uses mean demand over Periods 32\u201340 scaled by (1+L)); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=9 to reflect lower volatility in the recent low-demand regime. This keeps ordering aligned with the new low-demand regime, reducing holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32: avg weekly demand dropped to 14.78 (Periods 32\u201340 mean = 133/9) from prior recent mean ~63.25 (Periods 24\u201331 mean = 506/8), ~\u221276.6% sustained over 9 periods

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime beginning Period 32 (Periods 32\u201340 mean \u224814.78 over 9 weeks). On-hand=44, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory currently exceeds near-term expected demand so avoid aggressive replenishment to reduce holding cost. All concluded lead-times have been 0 so use promised/default L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to reflect the confirmed low-demand regime (use last 9 observed weeks). This keeps the base stock tied to the lowered demand and reduces overstock while the backend uses q=0.5 (z*=0) to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=27, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (no evidence of change), so keep L=default. Demand has shown a sustained downward regime since Period 32 (9 weeks, avg ~14.8) \u2014 use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lower mean and volatility rather than the long-run higher mean. This reduces target base-stock and limits excess holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Recent history shows a sustained, large drop in demand beginning at Period 32 (Periods 32\u201340 mean \u224814.8 vs prior ~63; sustained 9 periods). All observed lead times when arrivals occurred were 0; no evidence of delayed/lost shipments. On-hand=25, in-transit=0 \u2014 adequate buffer vs recent low demand. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (0). For demand I use recent_N=8 (most recent 8 demand observations, Periods 36\u201343) to capture the new low-demand regime for both mean and volatility, which avoids inflating orders from older high-demand periods and balances service vs holding costs.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 32 (weekly demand mostly 25\u21922 range). On-hand=20, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals visible. To avoid overstock given Profit=Holding, use promised lead time and base demand estimates anchored to the recent low-demand regime. Set L=default (use promised 0). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=13 (regime from Period 32 through Period 44, length=13) so the backend targets service appropriate to the lower demand and lower volatility, reducing holding cost risk.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=14, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 when orders were placed; recent long stretch of zero orders reflects a sustained demand drop starting at Period 32 (mean fell from ~63 to ~14.8). I set L to default (promised=0) because concluded history supports lead_time=0. For demand I use recent_N with N=14 (Periods 32\u201345 regime length=14) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 14 samples, capturing the new low-demand regime and avoiding upward bias from earlier high season. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=14 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices reduce overstock risk given low demand while preserving service within the new regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent sustained demand drop since Period 32 (weekly demand now low and stable). On-hand=8, in-transit=0 (no pipeline; many zero-order periods 39\u201346 suggesting supplier inactivity but all concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 historically). To avoid overstock while covering the new low-demand regime I use promised lead time (default L=0) and base demand estimates anchored to the recent post-changepoint regime (Periods 32\u201346, 15 weeks). Therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 to reflect the new lower mean and reduced volatility, letting the OR backend compute base stock and cap accordingly.
