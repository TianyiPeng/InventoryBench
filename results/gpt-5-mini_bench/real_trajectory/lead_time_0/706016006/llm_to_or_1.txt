Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show a clear upward shift starting 2019-01-21 (191,160,99). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current period demand plus lead/review. Promised lead time unknown to be different but no concluded arrivals to infer a change, so keep L=default. To capture the recent higher demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 3 samples (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) so the base-stock reflects the new mean; set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in that regime. These choices raise target inventory to improve service during the apparent demand spike while sigma_hat captures recent variability for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent 3-week avg = 150 units/week vs prior two-week avg = 28 units/week (+436%), sustained for 3 weeks through 2019-02-04.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent data shows confirmed demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (three-week high-demand run: 191,160,99). On-hand=43, in-transit=0; prior order in P1 arrived with lead_time=0. Use promised lead time (observed =0). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (protect service level while keeping holding cost low). Sigma uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect increased volatility in the new regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime beginning 2019-01-21 (weeks of 191,160,99 and recent sells 184,216), and two consecutive concluded orders arrived with lead_time=0, so actual lead time is confirmed as 0. On-hand=4, in-transit=0 \u2014 insufficient for the elevated demand. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (to confirm 0). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (use the most recent 3 high-demand samples for (1+L)-period forecast). For volatility I use recent_N N=3 to reflect variability in the recent high-demand regime. These choices prioritize service (higher mu_hat) while letting the OR backend cap orders per its cap calculation to limit excess inventory cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2714.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04): recent weeks show a sustained higher-demand regime (three recent concluded demands: 184, 216, 149). On-hand=117, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Observed lead times in concluded history are all 0, so set L based on calculated average. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (N=3 per detected changepoint length). These parameters raise the (1+L) demand forecast and variability to improve service given high profit ($19) vs low holding ($1).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21: recent 3-week demand average ~150/wk vs prior ~28/wk. On-hand=80, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible and concluded lead times have been 0 in all observed periods. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm the observed zero lead time from concluded messages. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (use the last 3 weeks: 191,160,99) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*recent_mean. For sigma I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping holding cost in check by limiting the horizon to the recent, sustained samples.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Recent history shows sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21 (weeks with demand 184,216,149,159,151). All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders arriving same period). I select L=default to use promised 0. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained elevated demand regime (last 5 weeks). For volatility I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability. This raises the base-stock to cover the higher recent mean while using recent volatility for safety; choosing recent samples avoids bias from low pre-shift weeks and accounts for no observed shipment delays.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded demand (Periods 1-6) averages ~163/week but last 5-6 weeks stabilized around 150\u2013160. On-hand=60, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0. To capture the sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21, set lead time to default (promised 0). Use recent_N demand estimates over the most recent 6 weeks to reflect the current regime for both mean and volatility so the OR engine sizes base stock to cover (1+L) periods under the new regime while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=60, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (Periods 1\u20137) show actual lead time = 0 consistently. Demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 sustained through recent weeks (higher weekly demand ~150+). To capture the new higher mean and recent volatility I use recent_N over the most recent 7 demand samples (periods 1\u20137) for mu_hat and sigma_hat; L uses the promised/default lead time (observed 0). This biases the OR engine toward replenishing to the new higher regime while reflecting current on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. On-hand=3, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 for all past orders (Periods 1-8). Demand has been in a higher sustained regime (recent weeks ~150-205). To match current demand regime and because promised lead time=0 is confirmed, set L=default. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the most recent 5 weeks (captures current elevated mean and volatility) so the backend's (1+L)-period forecast reflects the recent higher demand and limits stockouts while controlling holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained in prior record). On-hand=38, in-transit=0 so pipeline is zero; recent weeks show sustained weekly demand (Periods 1\u20139) so use recent data to capture current regime. Promised lead time has consistently concluded as 0 in history; keep L=default. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (last 9 weekly demands cover the sustained high-demand regime) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to meet the elevated demand while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (capture higher mean) against holding cost by not diluting estimates with pre-regime low samples.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=91, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders from Periods 1\u201310 all arrived same period). Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained elevated weekly demand). I choose default L (use promised lead time 0) because observed lead time = 0 across concluded history. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all historical samples (captures the sustained higher-demand regime while keeping calculations robust). This balances service level (capture higher recent mean) vs holding cost by relying on sample statistics rather than aggressive explicit increases.

Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=118, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=0 across Periods 1\u201311 (orders placed each period arrived same period).

For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (last 5 weeks) to capture the current regime and recent downward pull in the last two weeks; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the confirmed 0-period lead time and to recent demand shifts, balancing service level (use recent demand mean) against holding cost by avoiding overly long-window averaging.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has settled around ~120\u2013205/wk with sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (carry-over). On-hand=61, in-transit=0 so no pending arrivals to cover this period. All concluded periods show arrivals with observed lead_time=0, so actual lead time matches promised. To reflect the recent demand regime and prioritize service while controlling holding cost, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (captures the last 5 weeks of realized demand). I keep lead time as default (promised=0) because conclues consistently show 0. These parameters prompt the OR engine to target stock covering (1+L) periods using the recent demand level and measured variability.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent weekly demand has settled down from the large Jan spike; last 5 concluded demands = [165,121,119,150,138], recent mean \u2248138.6. On-hand=73, in-transit=0 so coverage is limited; promised lead time historically observed = 0 (many concluded arrivals with W=0). I set L=default to use promised lead time=0. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to target the current demand regime (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples), and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture recent variability. These choices focus orders on the recent lower-volatility regime and avoid overstocking from the earlier spike while restoring inventory from 73 on-hand and zero pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=35, in-transit=0; recent concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has settled into a higher regime; using recent_N (last 6 weeks: demands = 165,121,119,150,138,136 -> avg\u2248138) to capture current level and recent volatility. Choosing recent_N N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat gives the OR engine a forecast focused on the current regime (helps avoid overstock from older high outliers while keeping service for current demand).

Demand has operated in the elevated regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained higher weekly sales). To keep service while limiting holding cost, use promised/default lead time (L=default). Estimate demand from the recent elevated regime using recent_N=12 to capture current weekly demand level while smoothing short noise; apply same recent window for sigma to reflect recent variability.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent weekly demand has stabilized around ~140 units (last 5 weeks: 150,138,136,160,115). On-hand=74, in-transit=0 so we must cover current + lead demand without relying on incoming stock. Historical concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently, so use promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current regime and recent variability, avoiding older low-demand samples. This balances service (meeting ~140/week demand) against low holding cost ($1) by sizing orders to recent demand rather than the full historical mean.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 (every concluded order arrived same period). On-hand=82, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has moderated from the Jan-Feb surge but the longer sample (provided) is the best stable estimator. Therefore use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates (use all samples) so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/SD, balancing service vs holding cost given confirmed 0 lead time.

Recent demand (last ~8 weeks) has stabilized around ~120\u2013140/week after the early 2019 spike; no new sustained regime shift detected. To focus the OR engine on recent demand levels I set L=default (use promised 0), mu_hat=recent_N with N=8 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 8 weeks, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility. This balances a high service target (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95) while avoiding overreaction to the early large spike months.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). On-hand=89, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Historical concludes show consistently zero observed lead time \u2014 use promised/default lead time. Recent demand has moderated vs the large Jan spike; last 5 weeks demand = [160,115,86,121,78], recent 5-week mean = 112 units. To reflect current regime and limit stock risk, set mu_hat based on recent 5-week average (1+L)*mean with L=default(0). Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to capture current volatility (~32.5 units), avoiding dilution by older high-variance samples. These choices keep service high for current demand while limiting holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

On-hand=67, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty; expected demand this period (~144) exceeds on-hand, so ordering should restock to cover typical week. I use default lead time (promised 0, supported by all concluded arrivals) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, letting the calibrated base-stock and cap reflect the high service level implied by profit/holding costs (q\u22480.95).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15. On-hand=101, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time=0 (orders placed historically arrived same period). Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: Periods 18-22 demands = 121,78,110,146,111) is lower and less volatile than the early spike in Jan-Feb; to keep service without excess holding cost I use a 5-week recent estimate for demand and volatility. L uses default promised lead time (0). Recent_N=5 balances responsiveness to the current quieter regime while smoothing week-to-week noise.

On-hand=48, in-transit=0 so cover is low vs recent weekly demand. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 so use promised lead time. To balance service vs holding cost, I use a recent-window forecast (N=5) so mu_hat reflects current demand level and sigma_hat captures recent volatility; this avoids overstating demand from older high-spike weeks while restoring stock to meet ~1\u20132 weeks of demand given no pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=95, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders have always arrived same period), so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand (Periods 21-25 = 146,111,106,58,63) shows lower average than the early-2019 spike and some volatility; no clear sustained new regime (insufficient consistent signal), so set demand forecast to recent_N (last 5 weeks) to reflect current demand levels while keeping variability estimated from the same window. These parameters balance service (capture recent mean) and holding cost (avoid sizing to the January spike).

Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=52, in-transit=0; no overdue or missing arrivals in concluded history. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0). Recent demand has not produced a new sustained changepoint beyond the previously recorded Jan 21 regime shift. Use promised lead time (default) so the OR backend applies its known lead-time. Use default demand and volatility calculations (all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to let the backend compute base-stock and cap given profit/holding costs. This balances service (capture demand variability) vs holding cost without overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows stable same-period arrivals (observed lead_time=0 for all concluded orders) and a sustained higher-demand regime that began 2019-01-21 (noted in carry-over). Current on-hand=52, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Using default lead time (promised=0) because observed lead times consistently 0. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, capturing the sustained post-2019-01-21 higher-demand regime and observed variability; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) against inventory holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Recent concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods (all conclude messages show arrived=(ordered on same period, lead_time 0)), so use default promised lead time. Demand has moderated since the large Feb regime shift; recent 5 weeks' demands = [58,63,105,153,139], recent mean \u2248103.6 which better reflects current demand than the long-run average. I therefore use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the latest regime; this balances service (capture recent higher spikes like 153) while limiting holding cost by not using the inflated earlier-season mean.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected; no overdue or lost shipments observed\u2014historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=0. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (empirical confirms 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose default so backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that reflects long-run demand and the recent higher regime while letting the OR engine apply the profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; two recent large demands (P30=282, P31=289) produced stockouts. Historical concludes show lead_time observed=0 repeatedly. Demand shows a past sustained regime shift (early 2019) but the Sept spike is only 2 weeks\u2014insufficient to declare a new sustained regime. Use promised lead time (default L=0). Use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to adapt toward recent higher demand while damping noise. Use default sigma_hat (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)). These parameters balance higher service target after recent stockouts versus holding cost sensitivity (profit=19, holding=1 gives high service quantile).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Recent demand jumped sharply in September (Periods 30-33). To respond to the sustained high weekly demand over the last 4 weeks while keeping lead time at the promised 0, I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=4) so mu_hat reflects the elevated recent mean and sigma_hat reflects recent volatility. This ensures the OR engine builds a higher base_stock to avoid stockouts in the current high-demand regime while the low holding cost ($1) limits penalty for extra inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-09-02: avg last 4 weeks (Periods 30-33) = 323 units/week vs prior 12-week avg = 112.7 units/week (+186%), sustained for 4 weeks.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand regime: sustained high demand since 2019-09-02 (Periods 30-34). On-hand=223, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed and historical lead time has been consistently 0. To capture the elevated recent demand I set L to default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (the five-week high-demand regime, Periods 30-34) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the most recent high regime. This prioritizes service (avoid stockouts during the sustained spike) while keeping holding cost in mind since current on-hand is moderate.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent data show a sustained higher-demand regime starting 2019-09-02 (Periods 30+) with weekly demands often 250\u2013455 vs earlier ~100\u2013160. On-hand=200, in-transit=0; with promised L=0 arrivals occur same period when ordered but none currently inbound. I set L=default to trust the promised 0-day lead time (historical concluded lead_time=0 for all past orders). To capture the post-Period-30 demand uplift I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds base-stock around the recent high-demand regime (last 6 weeks) rather than the long-run mean. This raises the forecast mean and uncertainty, improving service during the confirmed higher-demand period while the capped ordering function limits extreme order sizes to control holding costs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand remains elevated since the regime shift starting 2019-09-02 (carry-over insight): recent weeks show high, volatile weekly demand (e.g., Periods 30-36 many weeks >200, peak 455). Current on-hand=270, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. I set L=default because all concluded historic arrivals show lead_time=0 (no evidence of change). To capture the recent higher-demand regime while reflecting very recent volatility, I use recent_N (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets stock for the latest elevated mean and observed variability (balances service level vs holding cost given high unit profit $19 and low holding $1). This keeps orders responsive to current high demand while limiting excess inventory buildup.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=302, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently (orders in history show arrived same period), so keep L as promised (default). Demand shows a sustained elevated regime starting 2019-09-02 (higher weekly demand through recent weeks); to capture current demand level and reduce stockouts I use a recent-window forecast. Select recent_N with N=8 (covers Periods 30\u201337) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the elevated mean and realized volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts in the new high-demand regime) against holding costs given on-hand stock.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent weeks show demand back below the Sep spike (Periods 35-38 avg \u2248 191/week). On-hand=235, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for near-term demand. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. No new sustained changepoint detected. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance (conservative given prior documented regime shifts) and avoids overreacting to the recent post-spike normalization.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime that began around 2019-09-02 (sustained high weekly sales). On-hand=126, in-transit=0 so pipeline is empty versus recent weekly demand ~194/week (recent 6 weeks). All concluded lead times = 0, so keep promised lead time. To capture the sustained higher demand while limiting holding cost, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 weeks (captures the post-Period-34 regime). This raises target base-stock to match current regime and lets the backend cap prevent excessive orders.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=93, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 0 periods. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since 2019-09-02 (elevated weekly sales through Periods 30-40). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (observed = 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=11 (last 11 weeks, Periods 30-40) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting dilution by older low-demand weeks. This focuses the base-stock and cap calculations on the current higher mean and volatility, improving service (reduce stockouts) while avoiding excessive long-term holding by not over-weighting older data.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=213, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. Demand regime shift to higher weekly demand began 2019-09-02 (Period 30) and has persisted; recent demand (Periods 30-41) is materially above earlier average. Set L=default (promised 0). For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime: choose N=12 (Periods 30-41 regime length = 12). Use same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These params bias orders toward current high-demand regime while keeping lead time as promised, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given elevated demand and low holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all arrived same period ordered). Recent demand shows elevated average since the Sep regime shift, with a single large spike at Period 42 (506, likely a promotional/Black Friday event) but not yet a sustained new regime. To balance service vs holding cost I retain promised lead time and use a recent-window demand estimate to lean into the higher post-September demand while limiting exposure to the single extreme spike. Chosen: L=default (promised 0). mu_hat: recent_N using last 8 weeks to capture recent elevated baseline without over-weighting one extreme week. sigma_hat: recent_N with N=8 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand (Periods 40-43) = [170,171,506,110] shows elevated and volatile activity including a large spike (506) but limited recent sample size; historical observed lead time has been 0 consistently. I choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0). To bias forecasts toward the recent regime while keeping responsiveness to volatility, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (captures weeks 40-43). This gives the OR engine a short-term mean and volatility reflecting current demand dynamics and balances service level (against the recent spike) with holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Recent demand shows a higher mean since the Sep demand regime shift and some volatility (recent 5 periods demand = 170,171,506,110,113). To balance service (high profit $19) vs low holding cost $1, I bias forecast to recent demand: use promised lead time (default=0) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 5 weeks to capture the post-regime demand level and current volatility while limiting exposure to older low-demand periods. This keeps orders responsive to current demand and avoids excessive stock from long-ago low-demand data.

Use promised lead time (default L=0) since all historical concluded lead times are 0 and no lost shipments observed. To avoid overstock from the isolated spike (Period 42 demand=506) I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (focus on the last 3 weeks' demand) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*mean of the most recent regime and scales volatility to recent observations, reducing the influence of the single high outlier and balancing service level vs holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and high profit ($19).
