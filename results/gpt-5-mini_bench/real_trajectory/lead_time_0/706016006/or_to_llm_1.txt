{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows all recent orders arrived same period (lead_time=0), so orders placed now would arrive within current period's demand window. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=230, in-transit=0. Recent realized demands (Periods 43\u201346) = [110,113,95,75], recent 4-period average \u224898. Expected single-period demand unlikely to exceed ~150 in the near term; OR recommends 73 but that would raise ending inventory and incur holding cost. Profit per unit $19 vs holding $1 implies high service target, but we already hold substantial stock (230 >> ~98 mean and >> single-period safety buffer). Final strategy: order 0 units to avoid unnecessary holding cost while current on-hand covers one or more demand spikes; monitor next concluded periods and resume ordering only when on-hand + in-transit falls below target base-stock (estimated \u2248 single-period demand + safety).",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Cut OR's 73 to 0 \u2014 on-hand 230 far exceeds recent average demand (~98) plus safety, so avoid extra holding cost; will reorder when inventory declines.",
