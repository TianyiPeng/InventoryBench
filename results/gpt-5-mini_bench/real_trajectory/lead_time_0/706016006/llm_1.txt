This is a sustained, material regime increase (~+436%). Lead time & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=0. Supplier promised LT=0, but actual LT is unknown; no concluded arrivals to contradict promise. Given uncertainty, plan conservatively assuming orders may not arrive before demand \u2014 therefore order to cover current period demand plus safety. Inventory policy & economics: profit per unit $19 >> holding cost $1, so downside of small overstock is limited relative to lost sales. Forecast & order quantity: use recent 3-week post-shift avg \u2248150 as expected period demand; add minimal extra safety given high profit and no pipeline.
