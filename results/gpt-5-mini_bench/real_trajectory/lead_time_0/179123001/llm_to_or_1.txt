Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is womens leggings with no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) avg \u2248103.4 units. Promised lead time is 0 and no evidence to adjust. Use default lead time and default demand/statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Period 1 conclude shows an order placed Period 1 arrived Period 1 (lead_time=0). Demand history (5 weekly samples through 2019-02-04) has mean ~103.4. Given confirmed same-period arrival and no evidence of a lead-time shift or demand regime change, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean and std. This balances service (use historical mean) vs. holding cost conservatively when inventory is zero.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Observed two concluded same-period arrivals (Period1 and Period2) \u21d2 actual lead time so far = 0. Recent realized demand (125,199) is markedly above the older Jan samples (~100), suggesting demand may be increasing but evidence is only 2 periods (not yet 3+), so I remain conservative. Set L to default (promised lead time = 0) because concluded lead times =0. Use EWMA (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat to bias the forecast toward the recent high demand while retaining historical weight. Keep sigma_hat default to reflect full-sample variability until a sustained variance change is confirmed. This raises target base-stock to help avoid stockouts given recent spikes while limiting excess holding cost risk.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2564.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (orders placed P1\u2013P3 all arrived with lead_time=0). Demand has shifted up vs earlier historical samples: last 3 concluded demands = [125,199,140] (mean=154.67) versus earlier sample mean=103.4. On-hand=96, in-transit=0 so current stock covers ~0.62 of the recent 1-period demand. I set L=default to reflect confirmed 0-period lead time; mu_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime observed over three periods; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand volatility. These settings tell the OR engine to target a higher base-stock aligned with the recent demand spike while keeping lead-time short, balancing service level and holding cost given the product's profit/holding cost ratio.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: recent 3 periods (P1\u2013P3) mean=154.67 vs prior sample mean=103.4 (+49.7%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=130, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times (P1\u2013P4) all 0 \u2192 use calculated average lead time. Carry-over note from Period 4 indicates a sustained demand regime shift: recent 3-period mean = 154.67 (vs prior mean 103.4). To capture the higher recent demand while limiting exposure to noise, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses the last 3 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This raises target base-stock to improve service given strong recent demand, while sigma_hat recent_N controls safety stock to balance $19 profit vs $1 holding cost. No overdue or missing shipments detected.

Daily Reward (R_t): $887.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=177, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders placed each period arrived same period), so keep L as promised (default). Recent demand (P1\u2013P5 = 125,199,140,90,56) shows no new sustained regime change (last 3 periods average ~95). Use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (no evidence of persistent elevated demand) against holding cost given healthy on-hand inventory.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-03-25. On-hand=78, in-transit=0. Concluded history shows orders arriving with lead_time=0 consistently (Periods 1\u20135). Recent demand (last 3 concluded periods P4\u2013P6 = 90,56,99) average=81.67, which is below earlier regime; I therefore rely on the most recent 3 periods to reflect current lower demand. Set L to calculated average observed lead time (0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes orders to the current lower-demand regime while keeping safety stock responsive to recent volatility.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). On-hand=7, in-transit=0; recent history shows a previously recorded demand regime change (sustained 3 periods). All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 so use calculated lead time. To capture the recent regime (regime_length=3) I use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent demand pattern and keep service while limiting holding cost. This ensures the OR engine's base_stock targets (1+L) periods of demand using the latest regime evidence.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has been elevated and more volatile vs the long-run (recent demands P6\u2013P8 = 99,112,128; recent mean \u2248113). On-hand=10, in-transit=0 so we must cover current period demand plus lead. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so use promised/default lead time. To reflect the recent higher regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 periods (captures sustained post-changepoint behavior while keeping N small per rules). This biases the base-stock up to meet current demand spikes while sigma_hat from recent data lets the OR engine size safety stock appropriately.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. Recent demand (Periods 5\u20139 = 56,99,112,128,89) indicates current regime closer to ~97 units/week; I therefore use promised lead time (default L=0) and focus forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current mean/volatility while avoiding older pre-shift samples. This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent lower-average demand and limits holding cost given low on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=55, in-transit=0. All concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically, so set L using 'calculate' (avg observed lead_time=0). Recent demand (last 3 periods = 128,89,87) does not show a new sustained regime beyond the previously recorded spike, so use population-based defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. Given profit $19 vs holding $1, maintaining full-sample forecasts supports high service with controlled holdings.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 7\u201311 = 112,128,89,87,115) averages ~106 units; on-hand=48, in-transit=0 so coverage is low versus typical weekly demand. Observed concluded lead times have been 0 historically (orders arriving same period). I choose L=default to use promised lead time (0). To reflect the most recent demand regime and avoid overreacting to earlier volatility, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures last 5 weeks average \u2248106). Set sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These parameters give the OR backend a demand mean and volatility aligned to current weeks, balancing high profit (q\u22480.95) with holding cost by not inflating safety stock unnecessarily.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=39, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 0 (orders arrived same period), and recent demand (Periods 8\u201312: 128,89,87,115,97) has mean ~103, matching historical sample mean (~103.4). No new sustained changepoint detected. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend uses (1+L)*historical mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, which balances service level with low holding cost given current on-hand and no pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=80, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 0 periods (orders in Periods 1\u201313 all arrived same period). Recent demand has softened versus the long-run mean (last 5 demands mean=93.4 vs overall \u2248108.9), so I bias forecast to the recent regime to avoid excess holding costs while preserving service. Therefore: L set by calculated average of observed lead times (0). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect the recent lower mean demand. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility for the (1+L) review+lead window.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=12, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently. Recent demand (Periods 10-14) shows moderate variability; to be responsive to the latest demand pattern I use a recent demand estimate (last 5 periods) while keeping lead time at promised and default volatility for the OR engine. This balances service (use recent mean) against holding cost by not inflating sigma.

Date 2019-05-27. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 \u2192 no available stock or incoming. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep promised lead time. Demand has shown variability and potential recent shifts; use an EWMA forecast to adapt to recent demand without overfitting (gamma=0.3). Use default sigma (all-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to provide stable volatility estimate given limited clear recent-regime evidence. These parameters aim to raise the target stock modestly to avoid lost sales while keeping holding cost impact controlled.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=72, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=0 every concluded order (P1\u2013P16), so I treat actual lead time as 0. Recent demand has been above original historical mean; to capture the recent regime I use an 8-period recent window (Periods 9\u201316) for demand mean and volatility, which balances responsiveness to the sustained higher-demand regime detected earlier while retaining enough samples for stable estimates. Using these parameters the OR backend will compute mu_hat and sigma_hat over the (1+L) review+lead horizon to raise the base stock relative to the long-run mean and reduce stockouts while the low holding cost ($1) keeps carrying costs modest.

Recent demand (last 3 concluded periods: 145,109,63) shows no sustained upward regime beyond earlier recorded shift; historical baseline samples remain appropriate. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level with holding cost given current on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=71, in-transit=0. Historical concluded data show consistent zero actual lead time (orders always arrived same period), so use default lead time (promised=0). Demand has varied but no new sustained regime change since the previously recorded Period 4 shift; recent 3-period mean \u224886 which is not a sustained upward/downward shift. To let the OR engine compute its statistically-grounded replenishment (base-stock and cap) using full-sample estimates, I select default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level driven by profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overfitting to short recent noise. On-hand + pipeline (71) will be evaluated by the backend against the computed base-stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=34, in-transit=0. No new confirmed lead-time delays (all concluded arrivals historically were LT=0); keep L as promised to let OR engine assume 0. Recent demand shows variability and a higher recent mean compared with the old baseline; to capture current regime I use a recent-N forecast using the last 5 demand observations (Periods 15\u201319) so mu_hat reflects the most recent demand level while sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This raises target base-stock to preserve service given low on-hand and zero pipeline while limiting excess holding by using a short recent window.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01. On-hand=108, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 consistently, so keep promised lead time. Recent demand has moderated from earlier spikes; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 16\u201320) = [109, 63, 86, 121, 49], mean \u224885.6 and moderate volatility. To reflect the most recent regime and avoid overstocking, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture current mean demand over the review+lead period. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent demand variability. These parameters bias the OR backend toward a smaller base stock aligned with recent lower average demand, balancing profit-driven service level and low holding cost given the current on-hand position.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=54, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. I retain promised lead time (default) and use the default demand/volatility estimators so the OR engine uses the full historical sample mean/variance (this respects the earlier sustained regime shift already recorded and yields a base-stock balancing profit ($19) vs holding cost ($1). Defaults avoid overreacting to short recent volatility given current on-hand inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=81, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0; no overdue or missing shipments observed. Prior carry-over noted a demand regime shift at Period 4 already recorded. To let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics and current promised lead time, I select default lead time and default demand stats (mu_hat and sigma_hat). This balances service (uses full-sample mean) vs holding cost given moderate on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 21\u201325) = [82,66,80,71,66], recent mean=73.0 \u2014 demand has moderated versus earlier spikes. Historical observed lead times have been consistently 0. I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to anchor forecast to the most recent steady regime (N chosen = 5 = recent regime length), and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders responsive to the current lower demand while avoiding excess holding cost given low holding rate ($1/unit).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). SKU 179123001: on-hand=28, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show all observed lead_times = 0 periods (no delays), so use default lead time to reflect supplier performance. No new strong, sustained demand regime change since the previously recorded Period 4 insight, so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR base-stock anchored to full-sample demand while the low holding cost ($1 vs $19 profit) allows a bias toward fill rate.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=97, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 0 periods so use default promised L. Recent demand has been lower than early-period spikes; use a short recent window to capture current demand regime. I choose recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the last 5 observed demands (Periods 23\u201327 = 80,71,66,58,52) so the OR engine targets inventory to current realized demand and limits holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$19. No evidence of new sustained lead-time or demand shifts beyond the previously recorded regime change, so no new carry-over insight.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=47, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been consistently low over the last 5 concluded weeks (Periods 24-28 demands = 71,66,58,52,50; recent mean=59.4) versus the longer-run mean ~103. To avoid excess holding while preserving a high service target (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 high fill-rate), I use a recent_N forecast (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent lower-demand regime. Promised lead time and observed concluded lead times remain 0, so I keep L as default (promised).

To target service while limiting holding cost, I use a lead time estimate from observed history and base demand on the most recent short regime (last 3 weeks) so the OR engine stocks for current demand levels.

No recent evidence of lead-time drift (all concluded lead_times=0 historically). To avoid overstating demand from early-season spikes, I use L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to target the current regime and reduce holding cost while keeping service for recent demand volatility. This balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use default promised lead time. Recent demand has moderate variation; to reflect the most recent pattern while smoothing noise, I use a recent-N forecast over the last 8 demand observations to compute mu_hat (covers (1+L)\xd7mean of recent 8). I apply the same recent_N=8 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This choice balances service (avoid stockouts given zero on-hand) against holding cost by focusing on recent demand rather than the full older sample history.

Recent demand shows elevated/volatile levels over last 5 periods (P30\u2013P34 demands = 65,43,97,121,98) versus longer-run; use a recent-window forecast to capture the upshift and volatility. Promised lead time historically observed = 0, so keep L=default. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 samples and capture the recent higher mean. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased short-term volatility; this raises safety stock and helps avoid stockouts while trading off holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$19.

This keeps base-stock responsive to current demand (~87) while sigma from recent variability informs safety stock to balance $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand 68, in-transit 0. Recent demand has settled below early high regime; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 33-37) = [121,98,62,57,64], recent mean \u224880.4. All concluded lead-times have been 0 historically, so use default promised L=0. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while retaining short-term variability; this keeps orders modest given zero pipeline and avoids excess holding cost. No evidence of missing shipments.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent realized lead times (all concluded periods) are 0; on-hand=66, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). Recent demand (last ~5 weeks) averages ~68 units/week, no sustained new regime beyond the previously recorded Period 4 insight. To avoid overreacting to short-term noise and because promised lead time is 0 with consistent historical confirms, I use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample. This keeps the base-stock rule stable, balancing a high target service level (q=0.95 implied by profit/holding) with modest holding cost given current on-hand coverage.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=108, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has softened vs earlier in-year: last 5 demands (P35\u2013P39) = [62,57,64,61,35], mean=55.8, lower variability than full-sample. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0. To avoid overstocking while preserving service, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (short window captures the recent drop centered on the low 35) and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect reduced recent volatility. These parameters bias the base-stock toward recent demand, reducing holding cost risk given current high on-hand and no in-transit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 0 in past periods; recent two decision periods had orders=0 but no evidence of lead-time drift or lost shipments. No new sustained demand regime change since the previously recorded Period 4 insight. To avoid overreacting to short-term noise and because promised lead time remains supported by concluded history, I use default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) so the OR backend computes a smoothed base-stock balancing $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=104, in-transit=0; recent concluded history shows all orders arriving same period (observed lead_time=0 each concluded period). No evidence of lost shipments. Given high profit vs holding (q\u22480.95) the OR backend should target a high service level; use default lead time and demand estimates so backend applies base-stock with its z*. Default methods use full sample mean/STD scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively, which is appropriate since no sustained new regime since the prior recorded insight. This balances high fill-rate objective against modest holding cost.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent history shows a single large spike (Period 42 demand=208, likely Black Friday/seasonal) but no sustained regime change (no 3+ periods of elevated demand). All observed lead times have been 0. To avoid overreacting to a one-off spike, use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend applies base-stock sizing with its high service quantile (profit/ (profit+holding)=0.95). This balances service level for the observed spike risk vs. holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=111, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (no evidence of delays or lost shipments). Recent demand is variable (including a one-off spike P42=208) but not a sustained new regime beyond previous recorded insight. To avoid overreacting to the single spike and because promised lead time has been consistently observed, use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/std. This balances service (using full-sample demand) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. On-hand=107, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods \u2192 use promised lead time (default). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P40\u2013P44 = 60,38,208,40,43) shows high variability with a single large spike (208) likely promotional/Black Friday noise; to keep responsiveness to recent demand while limiting influence of the single spike, use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets current observed demand level and observed volatility over the most recent week. This balances service (avoid stockouts after recent spike) against holding cost given already-high on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent weeks (Periods 42\u201345) show elevated and volatile holiday demand; to adapt while retaining memory of full history, set mu_hat via EWMA (gamma=0.3) to emphasize recent demand but not overreact. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to capture recent volatility (balances responsiveness and sample stability). These choices give the OR engine a demand forecast that reacts to the holiday spike while keeping lead time at the promised value to avoid assuming lost/delayed shipments.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=103, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been 0 periods (all arrivals shown as lead_time=0), so I retain promised lead time. Recent weeks show a sustained December demand spike (notably Periods 42,45,46 with demands 208,181,155) \u2014 I use a recent-window forecast to capture this elevated regime. I set L=default to trust promised lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 6 concluded demand observations (captures the Dec spike); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base stock to improve service during the holiday-high demand while sigma_hat ensures the OR caps order size sensibly given increased variability.
