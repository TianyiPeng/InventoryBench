OR recommended 225 (matches sample mean and its base-stock given profit=holding -> q=0.5). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=0.

Costs: profit and holding equal ($1 each) so overstock is costly; with a clear downward trend, bias toward lower order.

{
  "rationale": "Lead time inference: concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (all recent orders that arrived did so same period). Inventory & demand: on-hand=1, in-transit=0. Recent demands (P43\u2013P46) = 20,15,20,29 \u2192 recent 4-period avg \u224821 units; current date 2019-12-30 is post-holiday with no sign of imminent spike. OR's recommendation (138) uses long-horizon historical data and overstates needs given the sustained lower regime since P36 and recent low weekly sales. With lead time = 0 we only need to cover this period's expected demand; ordering more creates holding cost equal to profit (profit=holding), so avoid overstock. Final strategy: order enough to meet expected single-period demand \u224821 minus on-hand 1 \u2192 order 20 units.",
