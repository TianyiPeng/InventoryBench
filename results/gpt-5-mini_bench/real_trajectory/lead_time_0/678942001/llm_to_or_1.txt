Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demands (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show a stable downward trend but no evidence of a sustained regime change; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time and on-hand/in-transit = 0 so we must rely on historical demand. Promised lead time used (default). Use all-sample historical mean/variance (default) to set base-stock covering (1+L) periods; this balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost ($1 vs $1) so no bias toward extra safety stock absent evidence of higher demand or delayed shipments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed arrival: Period 1 order arrived with lead_time=0 (one observation). On-hand=22, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Profit and holding cost equal -> critical fractile q=0.5 so z*=0, base_stock \u2248 mu_hat. I set L by calculating observed lead times (average=0) to reflect confirmed same-period arrivals. I use default demand/volatility (all samples) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service (base stock tied to mean demand) against holding cost given symmetric profit/holding.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent sells: Period1 demand=203, Period2 demand=311; on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No overdue shipments visible; past two concluded orders arrived with observed lead_time=0. I choose to let L be 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (reflecting two confirmations of same-period arrival). Demand estimation uses 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, providing a stable baseline given limited recent history. This balances service level (using observed short lead time) against holding cost risk with a conservative aggregate demand estimate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $235.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Three concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 consistently; recent demand (last 3 concluded weeks) = [203,311,235], mean ~249.7. To capture the recent elevated demand while keeping volatility responsive, set L by averaged observed lead times and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (demand across review+lead period = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples; sigma scaled likewise). This supplies the OR engine a base_stock tuned to current higher demand while reflecting observed low lead time so orders can arrive same-period.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P1, P2 order arrived P2, P3 order arrived P3).

Daily Profit: $150.00, Daily Holding Cost: $100.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $50.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=100, in-transit=0. Recent concluded demands: P1 203, P2 311, P3 235, P4 150; historical weekly sample mean =225. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concludes. Profit and holding cost are equal ($1/$1) implying q=0.5 so target z*\u22480 and base_stock\u2248mu_hat; using defaults keeps base stock at historical mean and avoids excess holding given current on-hand inventory.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed) and demand averaging ~225 units/week from historical samples; current on-hand=103, in-transit=0 so coverage is ~0.46 weeks. Set L by calculating average observed lead time to reflect confirmed 0. Use default demand/volatility (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect all available samples (mean\u2248225) and keep ordering policy aligned to historical demand while avoiding excess holding given profit=holding cost. This balances service level (use full-sample stats) with inventory cost given on-hand already partially covers expected demand.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent demand (Periods 2\u20136 = 311,235,150,122,147) shows a lower, stable regime versus earlier historical samples. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior concludes, so use promised/confirmed LT. Use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility to reflect the most recent regime and avoid overweighting older high values; this balances service (cover current demand) vs holding cost by sizing to recent demand variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $123.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. On-hand=35, in-transit=0. Recent demand has declined from earlier highs (P1-P2) to a lower regime from P3 onward: demands P3-P7 = [235,150,122,147,158], mean=162.4. No overdue shipments (historical concludes show consistent 0-period lead time). I set L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with confirmed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new lower-demand regime (regime length=5 since P3), so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*mean of last 5 periods. I set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to the sustained lower demand while capturing recent variability, reducing excess holding with limited on-hand inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent concluded history shows frequent same-period arrivals and week-to-week demand samples ranging ~122\u2013311 with no in-transit or on-hand inventory (0,0). Carry-over confirms actual lead time = 0. No overdue shipments. To keep policy simple and aligned with observed lead time and full-sample demand history, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from all samples; this balances service (same-period replenishment observed) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concluded history shows on-hand=123, in-transit=0 and a sequence of same-period arrivals (Periods 1\u20139 all arrived same period). Carry-over confirmed lead time=0 earlier. Demand context: weekly historical sample mean=225 (samples: 346,235,196,176,172); recent weeks show demand in the 80\u2013181 range but not a sustained regime change. Pipeline is empty, on-hand coverage ~0.5\u20131 weeks of recent demand\u2014no overdue shipments. I select L=default to keep promised lead time=0 (consistent with confirmed arrivals). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I select default so the OR backend uses the full-sample (1+L)\xd7mean demand and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a balanced base-stock anchored to historical average while avoiding overfitting recent short-term noise. This keeps service levels aligned with profit/holding tradeoff given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=132, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages (P1\u2013P11) consistently show arrivals same period as orders; lead time confirmed 0. No evidence of regime change in demand (recent weeks vary but not a sustained shift). To keep policy aligned with observed operations and let the OR engine compute demand stats from full history, use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service level (use observed LT=0) against holding cost given current positive on-hand and no outstanding pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06): on-hand=110, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed earlier) and no sustained demand regime shift. With profit=holding, target service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0), so use default estimates: keep promised L (default) and let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples. This avoids overreacting to recent fluctuations while the pipeline is empty.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has trended down from earlier highs; last 5 weekly demands = [80,75,54,68,42], mean \u224863.8. On-hand=130, in-transit=0 so current inventory covers ~2 weeks at recent demand; no overdue shipments visible. Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded history. I set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current lower-demand regime so the OR backend reduces ordering and holding costs while preserving service against recent demand variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=19, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 10-14): 75,54,68,42,111 \u2014 materially lower and less volatile than the early-sample series (Jan-Feb). Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior carry-over. To react to the sustained lower demand regime evident for the last 5 periods, I set L to default (use promised lead time=0) and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts and safety stock reflect the current lower mean and recent volatility rather than the larger early-season samples. This reduces overstock risk (holding cost) while preserving service given current demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been volatile with a large spike in Period 15 (demand=272) after several low-to-moderate weeks (Periods 11-14: 54,68,42,111). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 in concluded periods. To capture the recent regime and responsiveness to the Period 15 spike, set L to default (use promised lead time = 0) and use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend weights the last 5 weeks (including the spike) when computing base_stock and uncertainty. This balances service (respond to the spike) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows volatile weekly demand with several large spikes (Periods 15-16: 272,246) but overall mean anchored by earlier samples. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover current period demand plus lead/ review. Previous conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 0 consistently; therefore use default lead time (promised). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging full sample pool to smooth recent spikes while the OR engine's service-cap calculation will cap order size to limit overstock. This balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff by letting the backend set z* based on cost ratio.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demand shows a rise in periods 15-17 (272,246,244) but the last 5 demands (P13\u2013P17 = 42,111,272,246,244) average 183. Lead time has been confirmed 0 in prior periods. I choose L=default (promised 0). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent regime including the recent spike while limiting noise from older data. This raises the baseline forecast to respond to higher recent demand but keeps variability estimated from the same window so the OR backend will raise the base-stock/ordering cap enough to improve fill rates while avoiding excessive long-term holding given symmetric profit/holding costs.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17. Recent concluded history (Periods 14-18) shows sustained high and volatile weekly demand (111,272,246,244,202) and confirmed lead time = 0 from earlier carry-over. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish for current-period demand. Choose L=default to use promised lead time (0) consistent with many observed zero lead-time arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime (last 5 realized weekly demands) so the OR backend sets base_stock appropriate to current higher mean and observed volatility, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Recent history shows many concluded same-period arrivals (lead time=0 confirmed) and a recent high-variance demand regime (Periods 15-19 demands: 272,246,244,202,130). On-hand=85, in-transit=0. I set L via recent observed lead times to reflect confirmed 0-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N=5 to capture the currently elevated and volatile summer demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine to target a base-stock appropriate for the current (1+L)-period demand mean while inflating safety stock for observed dispersion, balancing service vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows realized lead time = 0 periods consistently (P1-P20 arrivals matched same-period orders). On-hand=99, in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this period. Demand has varied but no sustained regime shift detected beyond normal variability. To keep the OR engine stable and leverage confirmed lead time, I use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost ($1/$1).

Recent weeks show variable weekly demand (ranging ~42\u2013272) with no new sustained regime shift; historic concluded data consistently show lead time = 0. To balance service vs holding cost I use the backend defaults: keep promised L (0) and let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples so base-stock reflects full sample mean/variance and the capped order limit.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 0 (Period 1\u201322 arrivals all same-period). I therefore use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history; this balances service level against equal profit/holding costs by letting backend set the z* via profit/(profit+holding).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=29, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 0 periods; recent demand has varied week-to-week with many samples in history. To keep policy aligned with observed zero lead time and use full-sample demand estimates, I select default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from all available samples.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 (carry-over confirmed), so use promised lead time. Recent demand shows higher levels (last 5 demands: 171,83,109,139,234; mean \u2248147) vs earlier baseline\u2014use recent_N=5 to capture current regime. L default keeps arrival timing consistent with observed 0-period arrivals; mu_hat recent_N=5 targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean to meet current demand; sigma_hat recent_N=5 captures recent volatility to set safety stock appropriately given equal profit/holding costs.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we are fully exposed to stockouts this period. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (carry-over confirmed). Recent demand has been elevated and volatile; use a short recent window to capture current regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (will be 0). Forecast demand using the last 5 weeks to reflect the recent higher mean; use the same recent 5-week window for volatility to keep service targeting aligned with current variability. These choices prompt the OR backend to order for (1+L) periods of recent demand and use a volatility estimate that protects service without excessive holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time = 0 confirmed earlier) and volatile weekly demand (samples ranging ~42\u2013272). Current on-hand=8, in-transit=0 so we are lightly stocked. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (0) consistent with observed arrivals. I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend balance service level vs holding cost given high demand variability.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (orders in prior periods arrived same period). Demand history (many weeks through Period 30) shows no sustained regime shift; recent weeks demand ranges ~120\u2013240. I set L by calculating observed lead time (confirming 0). I use default demand and volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/std to produce a base-stock that balances the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost. This conservative full-sample approach avoids overreacting to recent week-to-week variability while acknowledging same-period replenishment and the current zero on-hand/pipeline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent weekly demand has been elevated (~140\u2013195 most recent weeks) and current inventory/pipeline = 0, so we must replenish to meet upcoming demand. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 0 periods, so use the promised/default lead time. Use default demand/volatility calculations (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR engine applies the full historical demand signal and its capped order cap. This balances service (avoid stockouts given current zero on-hand) against equal profit/holding cost (q=0.5 leads to moderate safety stock).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Carry-over shows lead time confirmed as 0. I keep L as default (promised 0) and use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all historical samples; this leverages full history while respecting the confirmed same-period arrivals and balances service level vs holding cost.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period fulfillment (observed lead times = 0 across concluded periods), and recent demand samples (weekly) are the primary forecasting anchor. I therefore use calculated lead time (average of observed lead times) to capture confirmed 0 lead time, and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples). This keeps ordering aligned with the confirmed 0-period arrivals, letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost using the full sample history.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28. Recent history (Periods 1\u201337) shows frequent same-period arrivals and demand variability; on-hand=86, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concludes confirm same-period arrivals. Use default lead time to keep backend aligned with supplier promise. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full historical demand to balance service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent concluded history (through Period 38) shows consistent same-period arrivals; prior carry-over confirmed lead time = 0. On-hand=122, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments. Demand history shows no sustained regime shift in the last 3+ periods (recent demands vary but return to typical range). I therefore use default lead time (promised = 0) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock aligned with long-run historical demand while avoiding overfitting to short recent noise, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=127, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent same-period arrivals => actual lead time remains 0. No overdue shipments. Profit=Holding => q=0.5 (z*=0) so base stock aligns with demand mean; use default statistics to let OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service vs holding given equal profit/holding and stable historical demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=140, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history (Periods 1-40) consistently shows actual lead time = 0; no sustained demand regime change detected. Profit = holding so critical fractile = 0.5 (balanced). Use default lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, yielding a neutral 50% service-level base stock that balances profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (Periods 1-40 arrivals all show lead_time=0).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). Recent concluded history (Periods 1\u201341) consistently shows actual lead time = 0. On-hand=133, in-transit=0 so available inventory is ample for near-term demand; no overdue or missing arrivals. Profit and holding cost are equal (q=0.5) so OR backend will target median service level (z*=0). Use default L to trust promised lead time (and confirmed by history). Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging the long history rather than short-term noise. This keeps ordering conservative given current high on-hand and avoids extra holding cost while preserving service.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=83, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 0 (Periods 1\u201342). Profit and holding cost are equal => critical fractile q=0.5 (z*=0). No clear recent sustained demand regime shift; seasonality (early December) does not show a confirmed spike in the concluded history. Use promised/default lead time (0) so backend treats same-period arrivals; use default demand and volatility calculations so OR backend computes base_stock = mean demand and sigma from full sample. This balances service level (q=0.5) against holding cost while respecting observed zero lead time and avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=129, in-transit=0. Recent weeks (Periods 39-43) show low demand (33,17,21,68,20) consistent with a lull into December. Historical concluded lead time is reliably 0. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (default) and forecast based on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current low regime for mean and volatility.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent demand has been low (Periods 40-44 demand: 17,21,68,20,15) and on-hand is healthy at 114 with zero in-transit. Historical concluded lead time is consistently 0 (orders arriving same period). To avoid excess holding cost heading into mid-December (no clear holiday spike for this SKU), I use a short recent window to forecast demand so the OR engine reduces order targets. L: use default promised lead time=0 since concluded history confirms same-period arrivals. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 5 demands and reflect the recent low-demand regime. sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=5 to estimate volatility from the same recent window. This keeps service reasonable while limiting additional holding given the large on-hand balance and zero pipeline.

Recent concluded weeks (Periods 43-45) show low demand (20, 15, 20) and lead time has been consistently observed as 0 through Period 41; no evidence of lost shipments. I use default lead time (promised=0) and default demand estimators so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance (leveraging the provided historical samples) to compute base stock; this balances service level vs holding cost given stable recent demand and no confirmed regime change.

Use default lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting it balance service vs. holding cost automatically given the stable lead time and no new regime shift.
