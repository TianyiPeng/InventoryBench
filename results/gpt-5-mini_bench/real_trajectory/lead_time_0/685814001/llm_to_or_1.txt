Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~97.2 units/week and std ~45.0. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed. Promised lead time=0; no evidence to adjust lead time or recent regime shifts. Use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) with available demand history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent conclude shows Period1 order (136) arrived in same period \u2192 observed lead time = 0. On-hand=45, in-transit=0, last period demand=91. No clear sustained demand regime change in available samples (historical mean ~97). Choose L by calculate to reflect observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This keeps service for the immediate (L+1)=1-period demand while avoiding premature inflation of safety stock given limited evidence of a shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history shows same-period arrivals (lead_time=0 observed in P1 and P2) and elevated recent demand (P1=91, P2=151 vs earlier samples). I keep L as default (promised lead time=0) since observed lead times confirm 0. To react to the apparent upward demand shift while avoiding overreaction to only two high periods, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the most recent 5 demand samples to adapt mean and volatility). This increases target base-stock to improve service given zero pipeline while letting the OR backend cap orders to limit holding cost exposure.

Daily Reward (R_t): $248.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 0 (all three past orders arrived same period). On-hand=68, in-transit=0; no overdue/lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 1-3) = {91,151,79} shows a modest upward shift vs older samples, so I bias the demand forecast to the most recent regime. Set L to default (use promised lead time 0). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to weight the last 3 observed demands ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3) to capture the current demand level. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep lead time aligned with observed arrivals, increase target base-stock to cover the slightly higher recent demand, and keep safety stock responsive to recent variability while avoiding excess holding cost given holding=$1/unit.

Daily Profit: $232.00, Daily Holding Cost: $82.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $150.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11. Recent concluded history shows four consecutive orders arriving with lead_time=0 and demand has been variable (historical samples mean ~97.2). Current on-hand=82, in-transit=0, so no incoming inventory expected. I set L to default (promised lead time=0) because concluded arrivals consistently confirm same-period lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples, providing a stable baseline forecast given limited data and avoiding overreacting to the recent single high spike. This balances service (using full-sample mean) against holding cost while acknowledging no pipeline cover.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 0 periods (observed: P1 arrived P1, P2 arrived P2, P3 arrived P3, P4 arrived P4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $375.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0 observed P1\u2013P5). On-hand=29, in-transit=0 so available inventory is low vs. historical weekly mean (~97). I choose default lead time (promised=0) since evidence confirms it. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all historical samples (no firm changepoint in demand yet) to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (using full-sample forecast) against holding cost given confirmed fast replenishment and modest on-hand stock.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical concluded demands show variable weekly demand (recent: 91,151,79,58,101,64) and lead time confirmed as 0. Given confirmed 0-period lead time and moderate demand variability, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set; this leverages all historical data and lets the OR engine set a high service level (profit/total cost = 4/(4+1)=0.8) while the holding cost is moderate. No evidence of a sustained demand regime change requiring recent or explicit overrides.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history (P1\u2013P7) consistently shows orders arriving same-period; actual lead time = 0. On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Profit/holding ratio implies high service level (q=0.8). I keep L as default (promised=0) and use default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) plus safety stock from overall std \u2014 this balances service vs holding given confirmed 0 lead time and stable recent arrivals.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent realized weekly demand has averaged ~81 units (Periods 1\u20138 demand: 91,151,79,58,101,64,59,46) and volatility has been moderate. On-hand=76, in-transit=0; no overdue shipments visible. Carry-over confirms lead time = 0. I use L=default (promised 0) to match confirmed same-period arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the latest 8 weeks\u2019 regime rather than older Jan samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility. These parameters provide the OR engine a forecast tuned to the current lower post-peak demand, balancing service (using recent mean) against holding cost given visible on-hand stock.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time=0) and steady weekly demand (recent demands 91,151,79,58,101,64,59,46,26). Current on-hand=84, in-transit=0 so available stock is ample for near-term demand. No sustained demand regime change detected. Use default lead time (promised 0) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across samples to balance service level vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-42.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-22: recent demand has declined sharply and settled at a lower level (Periods 6-10 demands = 64,59,46,26,15; recent mean \u2248 42). On-hand=102, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. Lead time behavior has been consistently 0 in concluded history. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0). For demand I detect a sustained downward regime (\u22655 periods) so I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to reflect the lower recent mean and reduced volatility. This reduces overstock risk (holding cost $1) while maintaining service via the OR base-stock computed from recent demand stats.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent history shows consistent same-period arrivals (lead time observed 0 in multiple concluded periods) and recent demand rounds: last period demand=90 with on-hand=12 and no in-transit. Promised lead time = 0 and historical concluded lead times confirm 0, so use default lead time. No clear sustained demand regime shift (demands fluctuate but no 3+ period upward or downward shift), so use default demand estimates based on all samples to let OR backend compute base_stock and caps. This balances service (use full-sample mean) against holding cost given modest on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=24, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 0 (P1\u2013P12 arrivals all same-period). Demand history shows variable weekly sales; no sustained new demand regime detected. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent sell-through shows moderate, stable weekly demand; on-hand=75, in-transit=0 so available inventory covers several weeks. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 consistently. I therefore use default lead time (promised 0). No strong recent demand regime shift detected vs provided historical samples, so use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service (use historical mean) while avoiding extra holding given holding cost >0.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent weeks show moderate, stable demand (weekly sales in history mostly 15\u2013101, recent 5 weeks: 90,90,49,36,39). On-hand=70, in-transit=0 so current availability covers ~1\u20132 weeks at recent rates. Prior carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 0. No sustained demand regime shift detected (historical sample mean ~97.2 from provided samples; recent weeks somewhat lower but not a sustained 3+ period change). To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full-sample forecasting, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given reasonable on-hand inventory and no evidence of lost shipments.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201316 arrivals matched same-period orders). Recent demand shows weekly sales varying ~15\u2013151 with recent periods (P12\u2013P16) averaging lower (\u224850s). On-hand=80, in-transit=0 so current coverage is ~1\u20132 weeks at recent demand rates. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time 0 (confirmed by concluded history). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses all historical samples for the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility; this balances service level vs holding cost given stable lead time and no evidence of sustained regime shift.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand has moderated compared to early high-volume weeks; last 8 observed demands (Periods 10\u201317) = [15,90,90,49,36,39,27,17] with mean \u224845.4, showing a lower central tendency but with occasional spikes. On-hand=88, in-transit=0 so current coverage is ~2 weeks at the recent average. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history, so I use the default (promised) lead time. To make the forecast responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while still capturing remaining variability from the intermittent spikes, I use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 8 samples). This balances service (covers the immediate demand) and holding cost by focusing the base-stock on the most recent demand pattern rather than the earlier higher-demand periods.

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=68, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed earlier). Recent demand has been moderate-to-low, but longer history (Jan\u2013Feb samples) shows mean ~97.2 and std ~40.3. I retain promised lead time (0) and use default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (using full historical mean) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand = 93, in-transit = 0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (Periods 1\u201319); keep promised lead time. Demand has fallen materially versus early-year samples; the most recent 3 concluded demands (Periods 17-19 = 17, 20, 9) form a new, lower regime. To avoid overstock given high on-hand and lower recent demand, set L to default (promised 0) and use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest low-demand regime and reduce replenishment aggressiveness.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=86, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=0 (carry-over already recorded). Recent weekly demand has been low (single- to low-double digits in recent weeks) compared with earlier samples. No sustained demand regime change or lost shipments observed. I therefore use default lead time so the OR backend trusts the promised L=0, and default demand/volatility (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) so the backend's base-stock and cap calculations reflect the full historical sample set while avoiding overfitting to short recent blips. This balances service level (use full history) against holding cost given positive on-hand inventory and no pipeline.

Historical concludes consistently show orders arriving same period (lead time=0 confirmed in Period 5 and repeatedly thereafter), and recent demand has been low-to-moderate (most recent weekly sales mostly under 100). No overdue shipments noted. I therefore use default lead time so backend uses the promised 0. I also select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples\u2014this leverages the full sample history for stable base-stock given no strong recent regime shift and balances service level vs holding cost.

Recent weekly demand has been lower vs. early-year samples (summer: many weeks under 50), but historical lead time has been consistently 0 (confirmed through Period 22 concludes). To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and full-sample demand statistics, I select default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so the engine computes base stock from all samples while accounting for L=0.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has fallen vs. winter months: last 5 concluded demands = [9,7,29,44,41], avg=26.0 units/week. On-hand=55, in-transit=0, so current stock covers ~2 weeks at recent pace. Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 0 in prior concludes (carry-over). To avoid overstocking given low summer demand, set L=default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the clear downward regime; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat so variability reflects the recent low-demand period. These parameters tell the OR backend to target ~26 units (1+L=1 period) with risk buffer proportional to recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent weekly demand has settled lower (many weeks since Period 11 showing single-digit-to-40 range, recent weeks 26,29,44,41,26, etc.) and on-hand=29, in-transit=0. Lead time previously confirmed as 0 (carry-over). I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0). For demand I detect a sustained lower-demand regime starting at Period 11 (14 periods long), so use recent_N with N=14 to focus the forecast on the recent regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This reduces overstating mean/volatility from early high-demand weeks and helps the OR backend lower order quantities to balance profit vs holding cost given current stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages (through Period 25) show consistent same-period arrivals; lead time confirmed as 0 in prior insight. Demand history shows moderate, stable weekly demand. To avoid overstock given holding cost = $1 and profit = $4 (service target q = 4/(4+1)=0.8) and no evidence of a recent demand regime shift, use promised lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps base-stock tied to long-run mean while capping orders via backend cap to limit risk from zero on-hand/in-transit.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=23, in-transit=0, no overdue arrivals. Historical concluded messages consistently show orders arriving same period (lead time 0 confirmed). Recent weekly demand has trended moderate (last several concluded demands: 70,23; prior weeks 78,26,41,44,29...), so maintain baseline forecasting. I select L=default to use the promised/confirmed 0-period lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps the base-stock tied to long-run demand while the backend's cap limits excessive orders, balancing service level (profit per unit $4) against holding cost ($1/unit/period) given current small on-hand and no pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 \u2192 use promised lead time. Recent demand shows a large spike in Period 27 (130) but prior weeks lower; to balance responsiveness to the recent rise while smoothing volatility, set demand estimates from the most recent 7 weeks. Use recent_N (N=7) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 7 samples, giving more weight to recent regime without overreacting to a single-week spike.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Recent demand shows a sustained uptick: last 5 weeks demands = [26,78,70,130,130] with the two most recent weeks at 130 each, indicating a recent regime lift. Lead time has been confirmed as 0 in prior conclude messages. I choose L=default to trust the confirmed promised lead time. To capture the recent demand increase while retaining some smoothing, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (covers the last 5 observed weeks) so the OR backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent window. This balances higher service needs due to the uptick against holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=66, in-transit=0. Historical concludes (P1\u2013P29) consistently show arrivals in same period => actual lead time confirmed 0. No sustained demand regime change detected; recent weeks show elevated demand spikes (Periods 26\u201329) but not sustained long enough to declare a regime shift. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps policy aligned with observed zero lead time and avoids overreacting to short recent spikes while balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. Recent demand has stepped up with large spikes (Periods 27-30: 130,130,58,242), indicating a higher recent mean than the long-run sample. On-hand and in-transit are 0 so we must replenish for the (1+L) review horizon. Actual lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history; use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the current higher-demand regime (captures the last 5 demands: P26\u2013P30) so the backend raises the base stock without over-relying on older low-demand weeks.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent weeks show a clear uptick in demand (Periods 28-32 demands = 130, 58, 242, 217, 205) indicating a new high-demand regime starting late Aug\u2013Sep. No overdue shipments observed (recent lead times confirmed 0). I set L=default to use the promised lead time (0) consistent with concluded arrivals. To capture the recent demand surge and elevated variability, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a higher base stock reflecting the last 5 weeks' mean and std; this increases service while limiting unnecessary holding by focusing on the new regime rather than all historical low-demand periods.

Recent weeks show a clear regime shift to much higher demand (Periods 30-33 demand = 242, 217, 205, 374; recent mean \u2248259.5) vs earlier low seasonality. No evidence of lead-time change (confirmed L=0 in Period 5 carry-over). To capture the new high-demand regime I set L=default to trust promised 0, and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a base-stock that reflects the last 4 weeks' elevated demand and increased variability, improving service during the surge while limiting excess holding cost once/if demand falls.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). On-hand=67, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 0 (carry-over). Recent periods (P30\u2013P34) show a sustained large demand surge (5 periods) vs prior history. To capture the elevated demand while respecting the confirmed 0 promised lead time, set L=default so backend uses promised 0. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to base mu_hat on the last 5 high-demand samples (periods 30\u201334) so base-stock reflects the new higher regime. Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility during the surge. These choices reduce stockouts during the confirmed surge while keeping holding risk tied to recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 30\u201334: avg demand = 259.4 over 5 periods (sustained 5-period surge)

Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=147, in-transit=0. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=0 (orders arriving same period). Recent demand showed a sustained surge in Periods 30\u201334 (avg=259.4 over 5 weeks); Periods 35\u201336 moderated (240,169) but the 5-period surge is a meaningful recent regime. No shipments are overdue. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (0) given consistent evidence. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base forecast on the detected recent high-demand regime (periods 30\u201334) so the base-stock covers the (1+L) review+lead window under the new regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture the elevated volatility observed during that surge and keep safety stock responsive to recent variability. These settings prioritize service during the confirmed recent surge while limiting excess holding by using a short recent window.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weeks (Periods 30\u201334) show a sustained demand surge (~259 avg) so I bias forecast to the recent high regime. On-hand=130, in-transit=0; with promised lead time=0 arrivals happen same period so pipeline = on-hand. I set L=default to trust confirmed 0-period lead time. I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the 5-period high-demand regime. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to reflect volatility during that recent regime. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during the sustained surge while sigma increases safety stock; using recent_N keeps responsiveness and limits excess holding given $1/unit holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent weeks (Periods 30\u201338) showed a sustained demand surge versus earlier history; on-hand = 162, in-transit = 0, no overdue shipments (lead time historically 0). To respond to the higher recent demand while limiting holding cost, set lead time = default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base-stock reflecting the most recent high-demand regime (captures Weeks 34\u201338 behavior) and reduces overweighting of older low-demand weeks.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Lead time has been consistently observed as 0 (confirmed in carry-over). On-hand=65, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 35\u201339) = [240,169,185,152,175], mean=184.2 over last 5 periods, which reflects a post-surge settling lower than the peak at P30\u201334 but still elevated vs. early-year levels. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (0) since observations confirm it. I select mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to make the OR engine responsive to the most recent regime (captures the post-surge demand average and variability), balancing service-level (profit $4 vs holding $1) with holding cost by keeping the forecast tied to recent realized demand rather than the older surge or very old low-demand data.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand remains elevated since the late-September surge (Periods 30\u201334) and the last 5 periods show sustained high weekly demand: Periods 36\u201340 demands = [169,185,152,175,189], average \u2248 174. On-hand=24, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover (1+L) periods ahead. Lead time has been consistently 0 in concluded history (Periods 1\u201340), so use default promised L=0. To capture the current elevated regime while limiting excess holding cost, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the most recent 5 demand samples). Volatility also set to recent_N N=5 to reflect current variability. These choices bias orders toward meeting the current higher demand without overreacting to older low-demand periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; confirmed historical lead time=0. Recent demand elevated vs. early-year baseline (notable surge around P30\u201334 and sustained higher weekly sales since P35). I use default lead time (promised 0) so review+lead = 1 period. To capture the recent higher demand regime and reduce stockouts I set demand forecast using the most recent 7 weeks (captures P35\u2013P41 recent behavior) via recent_N for mu_hat and recent_N for sigma_hat with N=7. This focuses the base-stock on current elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility; using recent estimates helps the OR backend balance service level (avoid lost sales) against holding cost given on-hand=0 and no pipeline.

Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 0 (sustained observations). Demand shifted upward around Periods 30\u201334 (carry-over note) and recent weeks show elevated and volatile demand (including a large one-off spike at P42 likely promotional/holiday). To balance service and holding cost I keep L=default (promised 0, confirmed). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bias the forecast toward the recent elevated regime while limiting influence of the single extreme P42 outlier by using a short recent window.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=320, in-transit=0. No overdue shipments; historical concluded lead times confirm L=0. Recent demand shows an elevated regime (Periods 30\u201334 avg=259.4) and a strong recent spike around late Nov (Period 42 demand=690). To capture the elevated/holiday demand while limiting exposure to holding cost, I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the base-stock reflects the most recent regime including the spike. L set to default (promised=0) since concluded history consistently shows 0 lead time.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 0 (arrivals match orders every concluded period) and a past demand surge in Periods 30\u201334; latest weeks (P42\u2013P44) show elevated but variable holiday demand with on-hand=228, in-transit=0. To avoid overreacting to a short holiday spike while preserving service, use the promised lead time (default L=0) and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full historical samples (default) so the backend's capped base-stock calculation smooths holiday volatility versus myopic recent-only estimates. This balances holding cost vs service given current healthy on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Lead time historically confirmed 0. To prioritize service during this sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the latest surge while keeping L=default (promised=0). This increases target base stock to avoid stockouts over the review+lead period while the OR cap limits extreme over-ordering.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). On-hand=336, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 0 (confirmed previously). Recent demand elevated: last 5 concluded demands (P42\u2013P46) = [690,156,249,257,158], mean \u2248 302; this captures the recent post-Black-Friday spike and gives a conservative short-horizon forecast. I set L=default to respect the promised lead time (0) given consistent evidence. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets inventory to cover the current high-demand regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand periods. This balances service level (using recent high mean) against holding cost by not inflating parameters with very long historical averages.
