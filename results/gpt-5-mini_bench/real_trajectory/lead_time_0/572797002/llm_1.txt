No concluded arrival messages exist to infer actual lead time or lost orders; promised lead time=0 but must not assume an arrival delay\u2014per instructions only concluded messages confirm lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, so to meet Period 1 customer demand (which occurs after decision) we need to order now. Holding cost is low ($1/unit/period) while profit is high ($19/unit), so stocking to expected demand maximizes reward. I choose to cover the expected demand (~81 units) for the upcoming period with a small rounding to the historical average. If future concluded messages indicate lead-time issues or sustained demand shifts, orders will be adjusted.",
