Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). SKU is a seasonal casual womens tanktop; no on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Historical weekly samples (5 weeks) show mean demand \u224880.8 units/week and moderate variability. Promised lead time used (default) since no observed lead-time data. Use default demand and volatility calculations so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly samples (Jan 2019) show mean demand ~80.8 units/week. Period 1 concluded an order of 104 arriving with lead_time=0 and full sell-through (demand 105, sold 104) leaving on-hand=0 and no in-transit. Promised lead time=0 is confirmed by the single concluded arrival; no sustained lead-time shift detected. Given high profit vs holding (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 target service quantile \u22480.95), I use default calculations so the OR backend computes base-stock using all samples and the promised lead time. This keeps service high while letting the OR engine cap orders via its cap formula.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2128.00

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concludes show two consecutive 0-period arrivals (Period1 and Period2), so inferred lead time = 0. Historical weekly demand (Jan samples) mean ~80.8 but recent selling in Feb (105,163) is higher; however this is only two periods \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. Use calculate for L to reflect observed lead times. Use EWMA (gamma=0.5) for mu_hat to adapt toward recent higher demand while still anchored to historical samples. Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples) because volatility estimate from full history remains appropriate.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3058.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=20, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-3) is much higher than older sample mean. Observed lead times from concluded periods are all 0, so set L by calculating observed average. Demand forecast uses recent_N to capture the apparent regime shift (use last 3 realized demands: 105,163,162). Volatility also set from these 3 recent demands to reflect current variability. These parameters raise the backend base-stock to improve service while keeping holding cost in mind given current on-hand=20 and no pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Periods 1-3: historical mean=80.8 -> recent mean=143.33 (+77%), sustained for 3 periods

Daily Profit: $3762.00, Daily Holding Cost: $0.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $3762.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. All concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 0 (orders placed arrived same period). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must cover immediate demand. Historical weekly samples (Jan) show low baseline, but recent weeks show a sustained demand increase (periods with demands 105,163,162,207). To capture the new higher regime I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=4 (covers the four most recent observations) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. L uses default (promised lead time 0) because concluded messages consistently show 0 lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1871.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). On-hand=124, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times = 0 (all observed arrivals show lead_time 0), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand shows elevated and variable values; to capture the most recent regime I use the last 3 periods (Periods 3-5) for both mean and volatility. Profit >> holding cost (high service target), so recent_N with N=3 raises target stock to protect against stockouts while limiting excess holding.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent realized demand (Periods 4-6 = 207,105,190; mean=167.33) is substantially above the longer-run historical mean (80.8) and above the prior detected shift (Periods1-3 mean=143.33). On-hand=53, in-transit=0 and promised lead time=0 historically confirmed (all concluded lead_times=0). To protect service and reflect the higher recent demand, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility from the last 3 periods. This raises target base-stock to meet the elevated demand while keeping holding costs visible to the OR engine.

Daily Reward (R_t): $3942.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=48, in-transit=0. Recent demand has shifted up and become more volatile (recent weeks: 105,190,210; prior recent block also elevated vs. historical). All concluded lead times = 0 (orders arriving same period), so use promised lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the last 5 demand observations to reflect the new mean/variance while avoiding overfitting to a single spike). This increases target base-stock to protect service while sigma_hat recent_N reflects elevated variability to temper order sizes versus holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $4153.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand has been elevated (last several weeks: 190,210,220) versus historical Jan baseline ~81. On-hand=27, in-transit=0 so current cover is low for next-week demand. Promised lead time is 0 and observed lead times have been 0 consistently, so use default lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime, set mu_hat from the recent 5-week demand sample so the backend scales (1+L)\xd7mean_recent and raises target base-stock. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock responsive while avoiding excessive holding costs.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): recent demand has been high (last 5 demands: 105,190,210,220,188). On-hand=76, in-transit=0 so no incoming coverage. Observed concluded lead times are all 0, so average lead time = 0. I set L using 'calculate' to reflect observed lead_time=0. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated recent demand regime (uses the last 5 samples), which balances higher service level need against holding cost given current on-hand stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime: last 5 demands = [190,210,220,188,208], mean=203.2. On-hand=50, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments observed; actual lead time consistently observed as 0 in concluded history (P1-P10). Use promised lead time (default L=0). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5). For volatility use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand variability and let the OR engine compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 5 samples. These parameters align safety stock to the new regime while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=134, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 periods (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use promised lead time. Demand has been in a higher regime since ~Period 5 (sustained elevated weekly sales ~190-337); I therefore base forecasts on the most recent contiguous high-demand regime (Periods 5-12, length=8) to capture current demand level and volatility. Using recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat will let the OR engine compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the recent regime; keeping L=default ensures orders are timed for same-period arrival, avoiding artificial pipeline assumptions given confirmed lead_time=0. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) while avoiding excess holding given modest holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=245, in-transit=0, promised lead time=0 and all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically. Recent demand (Periods 9-13 = 188,208,337,197,67) shows a higher mean and volatility than the original Jan samples; to reflect current regime and keep service while avoiding excessive holding, I use L=default (promised 0). I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to target (1+L)\xd7recent mean (~199.4 units) so base-stock responds to elevated recent demand. I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to capture recent demand variability for safety stock. This balances profit-driven service level against holding cost given large on-hand but no in-transit.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has dropped sharply after a large spike in Period 11 (337) \u2014 last three demands = 197, 67, 61, suggesting a new lower regime and much lower short-run demand. On-hand is high (296) and in-transit = 0, so avoid inflating orders. Use promised lead time (consistent historical arrives=0). Set mu_hat using recent 3 periods to capture the new lower mean and reduce order targets; set sigma_hat from recent 3 periods to reflect current volatility. This reduces holding risk while maintaining service for near-term demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=134, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times all 0 \u2192 use calculated average lead time = 0. Recent demand has fallen from earlier spike; use recent 5 weeks (Periods 11-15) to capture current regime (mean \u2248164.8) and volatility.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (last 4 periods: 67,61,162,209) shows a higher short-run mean than long-run history, so set mu_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the latest regime. Use recent_N for sigma_hat as well to capture recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts with currently elevated demand) against holding cost given sizable on-hand inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent on-hand=65, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0 (all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0), so use promised/default lead time. Demand history shows an earlier sustained regime shift recorded (higher recent mean); no new sustained changepoint in last periods (demands in P13\u2013P17: 67,61,162,209,180 are variable but not a new sustained shift). To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and long-run demand, I select default methods so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (profit >> holding cost) while avoiding over-reacting to recent variability. No evidence of missing shipments currently.

Promised lead time and observed lead times have been 0 historically, so keep L=default. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat to reflect the new higher demand regime across the review+lead period, and recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to capture elevated volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to improve service while keeping holding cost accounted for via the OR cap.

Observed lead times have been stable at 0 in concluded history, so keep promised lead time. To reflect the recent higher demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures current weekly demand volatility and mean across review+lead). This balances service (higher forecast) vs holding cost by relying on short recent history rather than long low-demand history.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weekly demand is elevated and volatile; last 5 demands (Periods 20-24) = [366,174,121,132,254], recent mean \u2248209.4. On-hand=115, in-transit=0, so need to replenish to cover upcoming week(s). I set lead time to promised (default=0) since concluded history shows consistent 0-period arrivals. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current elevated regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 \u2248209.4). I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility for service-level sizing. These choices prioritize meeting higher recent demand while the OR backend will cap order size appropriately to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=279, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0 periods; no recent evidence of lost or delayed shipments. A previously recorded demand regime shift (Periods 1-3) is already captured; recent periods show varied demand but no new sustained changepoint (needs 3+ periods). To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and the long-run samples, I select default lead time and default demand dispersion/mean so the engine uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service vs holding cost given high current on-hand stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=210, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 across many periods (Periods 1\u201326), and no sustained new demand regime beyond previously recorded insight. Given ample on-hand stock and stable observed lead time, use default lead time and default demand volatility/mean (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps the OR engine aligned with promised lead time while avoiding unnecessary extra inventory from overestimating demand.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=233, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has moderated versus earlier spikes; last several weeks show lower/variable demand. Promised lead time and all observed concluded lead times = 0, so keep L as default. To capture the most recent demand regime and variability I use recent_N on the last 5 weeks (captures the recent downward/volatile pattern) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock and safety stock to recent demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=194, in-transit=0. Recent realized demand has fallen from earlier peaks; last 5 demands = [254,99,79,53,59], recent mean=108.8. No overdue/lost shipments observed (all concluded lead_times=0 historically). I keep L as default (promised lead time=0) since concluded history consistently shows 0. To adapt to the recent lower demand regime and reduce holding cost, I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent 5-week mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) so variability reflects recent volatility. These choices lower target base stock relative to long-run averages to balance service vs. holding cost given current slowdown.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent sales history shows elevated but variable weekly demand through summer; on-hand=163, in-transit=0, no overdue shipments. All concluded arrivals historically show lead_time=0, so use promised lead time. To let the OR backend compute a base-stock using the full historical demand estimate, use default demand and volatility methods so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service level (captures observed demand mean) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=206, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 0; recent carry-over noted a demand regime shift earlier but no new sustained change in last periods (demand now moderate). To preserve service (profit $19 vs holding $1) use observed lead time estimate and let OR use full-sample demand stats: L set to calculated average of observed lead times (will be 0), mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default (use all samples). This keeps higher target base-stock given high profit/hholding ratio while relying on full history since no new changepoint is confirmed.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent weekly demand has settled around 50\u2013366 with no new sustained shift since the previously recorded early-period regime change. All concluded shipments show actual lead_time=0 historically, and current on-hand=206 with in-transit=0 is ample vs recent demand (avg demand moderate). I choose L=default to trust the promised 0-period lead time (backed by consistent concluded arrivals). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample history \u2014 this avoids overfitting to short fluctuations and lets the backend balance service level vs holding cost given stable patterns.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=205, in-transit=0. Observed actual lead times = 0 historically (all concluded arrivals had lead_time 0) so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 31-37 = 74,70,99,35,64,59,62) appears lower than earlier season peaks; I select recent_N=7 to capture the current lower-demand regime for both forecast mean and volatility. This keeps target base-stock aligned to recent demand and avoids excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit. No overdue shipments detected.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). On-hand=152, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 0, so use promised lead time. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks: Periods 34-38 = 35,64,59,62,53) shows a lower mean vs earlier spikes; to reflect current regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 samples (captures current lower weekly demand and volatility). This keeps target base-stock aligned to recent demand while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=126, in-transit=0. No concluded late arrivals; historical lead times consistently 0 in concluded history so use promised/default L. Recent demand has fallen versus earlier spikes (recent weeks mean ~53), so I bias forecasts to the most recent regime to avoid excess holding cost. Chosen L=default to match observed concluded lead times. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=6 (captures the current low-demand regime from ~Period 34 onward). This keeps target base-stock aligned to recent demand, reducing holding while maintaining service.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). On-hand=76, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has been lower vs earlier history (Periods 35\u201340 demands: 64,59,62,53,26,50 \u2014 a sustained downshift). No evidence of delayed or lost shipments; historical lead time observed = 0. To reflect the recent lower demand regime while keeping lead-time assumption aligned with observed history, set L to default (promised 0). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 6 weeks (captures the documented downshift). This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given reduced demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=36, In-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 39-41) = [26,50,40], recent mean \u2248 38.7 \u2014 materially below historical early-2019 mean (~80.8) and the earlier recorded regime shift. Use promised lead time (default L=0) because all concluded arrivals show lead_time=0 historically and no evidence of delayed/lost shipments. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to make the OR engine responsive to the sustained lower demand in the most recent periods (reduces excess holding while preserving service).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=0; recent demands (Periods 38-42): 53,26,50,40,125 \u2014 a noisy series with a one-period spike in P42. Promised lead time=0 and historical concluded lead times have been 0, so keep L as default. To respond to the recent demand pattern while not overreacting to a single spike, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (captures the last 5 weeks' mean \u224858.8). Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=92, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead-times have been 0 periods consistently, so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P39-P43) is materially lower than earlier peak periods, so set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to keep the base-stock responsive to the current lower regime and limit excess holdings. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (match recent demand) against holding cost given current on-hand stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=84, in-transit=0. Historical arrivals consistently show lead_time=0 (many concluded messages with W=0), so use promised lead time (default). Recent demand has been volatile in Nov\u2013Dec with a short spike (P42=125) but the last 5 periods show a moderate average (P40\u2013P44 mean=56.8). To reflect current demand regime while downweighting older seasonal peaks, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5). Volatility also appears driven by recent swings, so set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5). These choices aim to keep target inventory responsive to recent demand while avoiding overstock given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=79, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time=0; recent weeks show variable demand (spike at P42 then lower), no new sustained demand regime since prior carry-over. To keep OR backend anchored to long-run statistics while avoiding overfitting to a one-off spike, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so base stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) with volatility from all samples. This balances service level (use full-sample mean) against holding cost given current positive on-hand position.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=215, in-transit=0. Recent concluded history shows low December weekly demand (~30\u201350) versus earlier high summer peaks; no sustained new lead-time signals. Use promised lead time (default) so OR backend uses historical sample stats. Select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost without overreacting to short December dip. No explicit adjustment for missing shipments required.
