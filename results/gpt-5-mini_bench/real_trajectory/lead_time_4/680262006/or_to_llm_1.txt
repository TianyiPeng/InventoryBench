Recent demand has collapsed and remained low for many periods (carry-over insights already record sustained declines through Period 24). Recent 8-week avg (P39\u2013P46) \u2248 7.6 units/week \u2192 (L+1=5) period demand \u2248 38 units. Current on-hand = 164 and in-transit = 0, so inventory already far exceeds (L+1)-period demand and risking holding cost. OR's recommendation (147) uses older/higher historical demand and promised lead time; given confirmed lead time and persistent low-demand regime, placing any order would unnecessarily increase holding cost. Final decision: do not order this period.",
