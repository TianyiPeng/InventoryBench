Because the in-transit shipment may still arrive as promised and we need to cover the elevated demand over the full lead-plus-review horizon, I will order 161 units to top up the pipeline to roughly match the 5-period demand at the new regime.

{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed as 4 periods from history (Period1\u2192Period5, Period4\u2192Period8, etc.), so use L=4. Inventory: on-hand=42, in-transit=30 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=72 units. Demand: recent periods show a sustained low-demand regime (Periods 34\u201338 avg \u22489.8/wk; latest 4 weeks demands = 10,6,8,5 avg=7.25/wk). Required coverage for (L+1)=5 periods at ~7.25/wk \u2248 36 units. OR recommendation=143 units is based on historical higher demand and promised L; it would create excessive holding cost given current low regime. Risk of stockout is low because current inventory (72) > needed coverage (~36). Action: place 0 order to avoid overstock and holding cost while monitoring demand for any sustained increase. ",
