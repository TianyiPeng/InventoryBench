Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 618800007 has zero on-hand and zero in-transit. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean=64.8 units/week. No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time; promised lead time (4) will be used. I select default methods so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to set base-stock and cap, balancing service level given profit/holding costs.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 64.8 units/week; no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 order of 87 showed arrived=0), so no evidence of actual lead-time deviating from promised 4. On-hand=0 + in-transit=87 covers ~1.35 weeks of expected demand (87 / 64.8). I use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set, providing a balanced base-stock target that accounts for 5-period coverage of mean demand and historical variability while avoiding overreacting to a single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent realized demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean 64.8 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=171 (87+84 from Periods 1\u20132); no concluded arrivals yet but this is expected given promised lead time=4, so no evidence to change lead-time or demand regime. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples; this balances service level (covers current+L periods) against holding cost given profit=4, holding=1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=283. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean 64.8 units/week. Promised lead time is 4 periods and there is no concluded arrival evidence to contradict it (orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 concluding with arrived=0 is expected given L=4). Use default lead time to let backend assume promised L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of demand regime change or lead-time shifts.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=403 (orders placed P1\u2013P4); no concluded arrivals observed yet so cannot infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean 64.8. Promised lead time is 4 periods; none of the orders are yet past the promised arrival visibility window, so use default lead time and demand estimates. Using defaults keeps (1+L)\xd7mean demand and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std to let the OR engine compute base_stock and the capped order limit, balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost given current uncertainty and no confirmed regime shift.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-5) shows a clear upward regime (~60,121,110,115,101) versus older historical weekly samples (84,68,51,53,68). We observed an arrival in Period 5 for the order placed in Period 1 with lead_time=4, confirming promised lead time. To capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use the recent_N=5 periods (covers the full recent regime of elevated demand). This increases target base-stock to meet service while sigma from recent data reflects current variability, balancing profit vs holding cost given Profit=$4 / Holding=$1 (q=0.8 -> high service target).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (order on Period 1 arrived Period 5); Demand regime shift: recent Periods 1-5 avg demand = 101.4 vs older sample mean = 64.8 (+56.4%), sustained for 4+ periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent weeks show sustained higher demand vs older baseline (recent ~101\u2013111/week vs historical ~64.8). Pipeline = 429, on-hand = 0; two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. To capture the confirmed lead time and the recent high-demand regime, set L to calculated average of observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the last 6 demand observations (captures the sustained higher regime including Periods 1\u20136). This increases target base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N reflects recent variability, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). On-hand=0, in-transit=445. Historic concluded arrivals show consistent lead time=4 (orders P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Recent demand has shifted up and persisted: last 6 concluded demands (P2-P7) average ~112.5 units/week. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, set L by calculation from observed lead times and use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility reflecting the new higher regime and limited sample size. This balances higher target base-stock for service against holding cost given in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7); Demand regime shift confirmed: recent Periods 2-7 avg demand = 112.5 vs older sample mean = 64.8 (+73.7%), sustained 6 periods

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained upward demand regime (periods 2-7 avg ~112.5 vs older mean ~64.8; Period 8 spike also observed). On-hand=0, in-transit=449 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals are delayed until conclude messages. I set L based on observed lead times (calculate). For demand I use recent_N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime including the large recent spike; sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect increased volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to raise base stock for the sustained higher demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand 0, in-transit 604. Historic conclude messages consistently show 4-period actual lead time and a sustained demand uptick since Periods 2\u20137. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (all observed =4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (last 5 realized demands: 101,111,117,228,103) so the OR engine sizes base stock to the current higher mean and volatility rather than the older low-demand samples. This balances higher service-level needs against holding cost given in-transit shortfall vs. (1+L)-period demand.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand has shifted up and been sustained (periods 5-10 show high demand vs older samples). On-hand=18, in-transit=620 (pipeline ample). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; keep promised lead time. To capture the higher recent demand regime, use recent_N for demand and volatility using the last 6 periods (Periods 5-10) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand while pipeline prevents immediate stockouts.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple concluded P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7) and a sustained demand regime shift: recent periods average ~112.5 vs older ~64.8 (+~73%). Current on-hand=22, in-transit=599 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand elevated, so set lead time to promised (default=4) and base demand forecast using recent regime. Chosen L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat=recent_N with N=6 to capture the 6-period elevated-demand regime (keeps (1+L)\xd7mean based on recent high demand); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters increase base-stock to service higher demand while sigma based on recent samples balances service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift upwards (recent periods show mean ~112 vs older mean ~64.8). Current on-hand=7, in-transit=615 (pipeline large). To capture confirmed LT and higher demand while letting OR backend compute base-stock and caps, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 11 demand samples (covers the sustained higher-demand regime). Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. This prioritizes service (reduce stockouts given high pipeline and higher demand) while letting holding cost be controlled by the backend cap.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent demand has risen and remained elevated vs older samples; last 6 demand observations (P8-P13) average ~132 units/week, noticeably above historical mean. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. Current on-hand 143 + in-transit 483 = 626 units vs (1+L)*recent_mean \u2248 5*132 = 660, a small shortfall. To reflect confirmed LT=4 and the sustained higher demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, use a recent_N demand forecast over the last 6 samples to capture the new regime, and match sigma to the same recent window so safety stock uses current volatility. This balances higher service-level needs (protect sales/profit $4/unit) against holding cost $1/unit by basing orders on the elevated recent mean and recent variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime versus the older 2019 samples; last 6 demand observations (Periods 9-14) average ~115.8/week. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded P->P+4 arrivals). Current on-hand=170 and in-transit=458 provide ample pipeline cover; no evidence of new lost shipments. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (confirmed by history). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime ((1+L) scaling applied by backend). Sigma set to recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These params bias orders upward to meet the new higher demand while relying on confirmed lead time to avoid over-ordering.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs older samples (confirmed earlier through Periods 2-7). On-hand=160, in-transit=351 (pipeline=511) provides good coverage vs (1+L) demand but we must keep safety for variability. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand forecast use recent_N on the most recent elevated regime to capture higher mean (N=6). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices increase base_stock to match the higher demand regime while limiting excess by using only recent samples.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has shifted up and remained elevated vs older baseline (sustained for many periods). On-hand=183 + in-transit=334 => pipeline_inventory=517, which covers multiple weeks of elevated demand, so we need parameters that reflect the higher demand regime but avoid over-ordering. Set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 4. For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 12 samples to balance recency and stability). Use sigma_hat recent_N with same N to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend compute a base-stock that raises safety stock for the new higher mean while capping order size via the backend cap to avoid excess ordering given already-large pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since early periods with confirmed 4-period actual lead time. Current inventory: on-hand=181, in-transit=428 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand remains elevated. I set L by calculating observed lead times (matches confirmed 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=16 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 16 demand samples) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet the new demand level while sigma reflects recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts under elevated demand) against holding cost given substantial on-hand + in-transit stock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent realized demand has been well above the older baseline (sustained regime since Periods 2-18). Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed at 4 periods in concluded history. Given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (q=0.8) we want a high service level while avoiding excess stock; use latest regime samples to estimate demand over review+lead. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show LT=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use most recent ~12 periods to reflect current mean/vol and limit influence of the older low baseline). This biases the OR backend toward higher base-stock to meet demand spikes while sigma from recent data controls the safety-stock sizing.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=154, in-transit=421. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand has shifted to a higher regime (sustained elevated demand in recent periods). To prioritize service (profit $4 vs holding $1 -> high target service level) I keep L as default (promised 4). I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=7) to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent demand regime while letting the OR backend compute the exact aggregated forecast. I keep sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample variability scaled for (1+L). These choices balance higher service level required by increased demand against holding costs and acknowledge confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals at 4). On-hand=277, in-transit=141; inventory is ample vs recent demand so prioritize updated short-horizon demand estimate. Demand has shifted from historical mean (~64.8) to a higher regime but the most recent 6 periods show a moderate level (~88\u2013118 range) lower than the earlier spike. To adapt to the recent regime while preserving service, keep L as promised (confirmed=4) and use recent_N for demand/volatility focusing on the last 6 periods to reflect current demand pattern and reduce excess safety stock. These parameters will let the OR backend compute base stock tuned to current demand while capping orders to avoid overstock given holding cost > 0.

Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=286, in-transit=148. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations), so set L via calculate to reflect observed average. Demand has been in a higher regime vs older samples (sustained elevation across many recent periods); to capture recent mean and variability I use recent_N=10 (balances responsiveness to the sustained uplift while retaining enough samples). This increases base_stock to meet elevated demand while avoiding excessive overstock given holding cost $1 and profit $4.

LLM Rationale:
2019-07-22: On-hand=329, in-transit=139. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained higher-demand regime vs. the Jan baseline. To reflect the recent upward demand regime while letting the OR engine compute base_stock and caps, use promised lead time (default) and recent_N demand estimates (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend weights the most recent 20 periods' mean and std (scaled for (1+L)). This raises target base-stock to match sustained higher demand while keeping variance estimate tied to recent volatility; helps balance high service level (profit/holding => 0.8) vs. holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=274, in-transit=270 (healthy pipeline). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; demand has been in a higher regime for many periods (recent multi-period averages ~110\u2013115 vs older mean ~64.8). To keep service high while controlling holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 q=0.8 implies high fill target), use promised/confirmed lead time (default=4). Use recent_N for demand and volatility to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use a long recent window to smooth noise but focus on current regime). These settings push the OR backend to raise base stock to the new demand level while capping orders via its cap formula, balancing service vs holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent realized arrivals show actual lead time = 4 in many concluded messages; however some late/missing arrivals occurred earlier so use observed-average. Demand has fallen sharply in the most recent 5 concl. periods (Periods 21-25 demands = 74,43,31,55,47; recent mean=50) versus the prior high-regime (~112). To capture the new lower regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples. This keeps replenishment responsive to the recent demand drop while L=calculate lets the backend confirm continued 4-period lead time from concluded history. On-hand (242) + in-transit (298) is ample vs recent demand, so lower forecast avoids excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand regime shift: Periods 21-25 avg demand = 50 (74,43,31,55,47) vs prior regime avg ~112 (drop \u2248 -55%), sustained 5 periods.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=253, in-transit=239. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has shifted down: Periods 21-25 avg = 50 vs prior ~112 (sustained 5 periods). To avoid excess holding given high on-hand and lower demand, keep promised lead time, but base demand forecast and volatility on the recent low-demand regime. Chosen methods: L=default (use promised 4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent lower mean across the (1+L) review+lead window; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect reduced recent variability. This reduces target base-stock and limits additional receipts, balancing service with holding cost while pipeline clears.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has clearly dropped vs earlier high regime: latest 5 demands (Periods 24-28) = [55,47,48,29,42], recent mean \u2248 44.2 units/week. On-hand=378, in-transit=43 \u2014 inventory is ample relative to current demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost while matching the lower demand regime, use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and forecast based on the most recent 5 weeks (recent_N N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility. This keeps target stock aligned with the sustained lower-demand regime and prevents unnecessary replenishment given large on-hand inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Periods 21-29 (recent 5-period avg demand \u2248 43.6 vs prior regime \u2248112). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand = 369, in-transit = 0. To reflect the new low-demand regime I set L to default (promised=4) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts over the (1+L)=5-period review+lead horizon using the most recent 5 observations (regime length=5). This reduces future over-ordering given high on-hand inventory while still covering near-term demand uncertainty.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent demand has fallen materially versus the earlier high-regime: last 5 demands (Periods 26-30) = [48,29,42,52,30], avg=40.2. On-hand is high (339) and in-transit=0, so we do not need aggressive replenishment. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; use default promised L. For demand forecast use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new low-demand regime ((1+L) scaling applied by backend). For volatility use recent_N N=5 to reflect reduced variability in the most recent regime. This keeps target base-stock low, avoids excess holding given holding cost=$1 and modest profit=$4, and lets on-hand absorb demand while future orders are sized to the new lower-demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods 26-30 avg demand = 40.2 vs prior regime avg \u2248112 (\u2248 -64%); sustained 5 periods

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): recent demand has been in a sustained low regime since Period 30. Last 7 periods (P30-P36) demands = [30,23,20,42,15,6,10], mean = 20.86, std \u2248 11.9. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To protect service given low, stable demand while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised/default lead time and set demand forecast using the recent 7-period regime for both mean and volatility so the OR engine computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=214, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand has fallen and stabilized well below earlier regimes: last 8 demands (Periods 30-37) avg \u224819.4 units. Given low recent demand and large on-hand stock, use a short recent-window forecast to avoid over-ordering. Choose L=default to trust promised/confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 to reflect the current low-demand regime (captures last 8 weeks). This reduces target base-stock and variability estimate so the OR backend will cut orders and limit holding cost while preserving service for the observed low demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods 30-37 avg demand = 19.4 vs prior Periods 30-34 avg = 26.0 (\u2248 -25%), sustained 8 periods

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

Past lead time was repeatedly observed as 4, so use promised lead time.

On-hand = 190, in-transit = 0 \u2014 current stock already covers ~10+ weeks at recent demand, so avoid large replenishment. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods; keep promised lead time. To reflect the new low-demand regime, set demand forecast using recent data (last 10 periods) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and caps ordering volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=172, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has been in a low, stable regime since ~Period 30 (recent weekly demand ~9\u201342, recent avg \u224819\u201320). No shipments are currently overdue (no in-transit). To avoid excess holding cost while keeping service, use promised lead time and base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent 8 weeks of demand and volatility, reducing forecast toward current low-demand levels and tightening safety stock accordingly.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=160, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in prior conclues; promised L=4 remains appropriate. Recent demand has settled into a lower regime: last 8 concluded periods (P34\u2013P41) demand avg \u224811.8 units/week, sustained 8+ weeks. To reflect the lower demand and keep holding costs down while preserving high service (profit/total cost \u2192 q=0.8), I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=8 (captures the sustained low-demand regime). I also use recent_N N=8 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward a lower base-stock consistent with the new regime and avoid excess inventory (given current on-hand=160 and zero in-transit).

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 30 (avg \u224818.5 units/week). On-hand = 129, in-transit = 0; no arrivals pending. Promised lead time = 4 and historically confirmed as 4 in prior concludes, so use default L. To match the recent low-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N over the last 13 periods (Periods 30\u201342) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 5\xd718.46 \u2248 92.3 units. Use recent_N for sigma_hat over the same 13 periods to reflect reduced volatility. These choices reduce excess holding (holding = $1/unit) while maintaining service given low recent demand and confirmed lead time.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since ~Period 30; latest 8-week window shows subdued demand (recent samples used). On-hand=119, in-transit=0 so no immediate arrivals expected. Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods. To avoid overstocking while preserving service with high on-hand, I use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the recent low-demand regime (recent_N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)-period demand based on current low mean and volatility. This reduces excessive replenishment given large on-hand and persisting low demand.

On-hand=113, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for several weeks of current low demand; lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods. I therefore use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the most recent regime (last 15 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the sustained lower demand and reduced volatility; this reduces ordering to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service from existing on-hand stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=105, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has been in a lower regime since Period 30 (sustained ~19\u201330/week); recent 16-week window (Periods 30\u201345) shows consistently lower demand vs earlier high regime. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime while keeping lead-time as promised, I use L=default (promised 4), and set demand forecasts using recent_N over the most recent regime to avoid overstocking: mu_hat and sigma_hat both use recent_N with N=16 (captures Periods 30\u201345 behavior). This reduces target base stock and volatility estimates so the OR backend limits orders and lowers holding cost given large on-hand buffer and zero in-transit.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=100, in-transit=0. Historical concludes firmly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods earlier; no recent arrivals indicate no outstanding pipeline. Recent demand has been in a lower regime for many periods (e.g. Periods 42-46 demands = 31,10,6,8,5). I choose L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time consistent with past confirmations. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (last 5 observed weeks) so the OR engine sets a much lower base stock and avoids excess holding cost. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect reduced recent variability. This keeps orders conservative given high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4) and zero in-transit inventory.
