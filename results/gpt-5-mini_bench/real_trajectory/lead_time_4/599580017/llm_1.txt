Historical demand shows a clear upward trend in recent weeks (2019-01-21:61, 2019-01-28:98, 2019-02-04:152), indicating increasing weekly demand. No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no prior arrivals, so actual lead time is unobserved (supplier promised 4 periods). To cover the supplier promised lead time (L=4) plus the current period (L+1=5) while acknowledging demand growth, I forecast using latest-week demand ~152 units/week. Order quantity = 5 * 152 = 760 units to ensure pipeline covers the next 5 periods given rising demand. I do not infer any lead-time confirmation yet (no concluded arrivals observed). Holding cost is high (equal to profit), so this is a conservative cover sized to match projected demand rather than inflate safety stock.",
