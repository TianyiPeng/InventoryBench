Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals observed yet. Historical weekly demand shows a clear uptick in the most recent 3 samples (2019-01-21:61; 2019-01-28:98; 2019-02-04:152). Use promised lead time (default) because no concluded lead-time evidence. Set demand forecast using recent_N with N=3 to capture this new higher regime; use same recent_N (N=3) for volatility. This raises the base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead demand under the new regime, improving service during the emerging upward trend while the capped order limit will restrain extreme over-ordering given equal profit and holding costs.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent 3-week avg = 103.67 units vs prior avg = 0 (periods 2019-01-07 and 2019-01-14); sustained increase over 3+ periods.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (weeks: 61, 98, 152, 129) \u2014 recent demand materially higher than earlier zeros. On-hand=0, in-transit=179 (Period1 order placed; arrived=0 in Period1 conclude is expected given promised lead time and is not evidence of lost shipment). I cannot yet infer actual lead time from concludes, so keep L at promised (default). To capture the new higher-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N=4 (covers the four post-changepoint samples) and sigma_hat using recent_N=4 to reflect recent volatility; this raises the base-stock to meet higher service needs while the cap will limit excessive orders given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=354 (orders placed in P1+P2) but no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 cannot confirm a lead-time change from concluded history. Historical demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (3 most recent samples much higher). Therefore keep L as promised (default) and use recent_N=3 for demand estimates to capture the new higher-demand regime; match sigma to recent volatility (N=3). This balances service (capture the higher recent mean) against holding cost while not overreacting to possible delayed shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=591. Recent periods show sustained higher demand (Period1-3 demands: 129, 213, 175) consistent with documented regime shift starting 2019-01-21. Promised lead time=4; no concluded arrivals yet so use promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the new higher-demand regime (3 most recent periods). This raises base_stock to meet elevated demand while sigma_hat from recent_N captures current volatility; default L avoids premature inference of lead-time change given lack of concluded arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=833 from prior orders. Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence to change L. Demand has a sustained upward regime since 2019-01-21; recent weekly demands (Periods 1-4) = [129,213,175,173], use recent data to capture elevated mean and volatility. Set L to default (use promised 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the four most recent samples. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned with the confirmed higher-demand regime while the OR backend caps orders; retaining default L avoids mis-specifying lead time given no concluded arrivals and avoids over-ordering if shipments are delayed or lost.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has shifted upward and stabilized (recent demands: 129,213,175,173,181). On-hand=0, in-transit=684 (large pipeline). We have one concluded arrival showing lead_time=4 (order on P1 arrived P5). Choose L by calculating average observed lead times to confirm promised 4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the new higher-demand regime (N=5 equals available recent samples and captures the established regime). This keeps the base_stock tuned to current higher demand while the OR cap prevents excessive single-period ordering given the large in-transit inventory, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=696. Concluded arrivals show orders from Period1\u2192Period5 and Period2\u2192Period6 => observed lead_time = 4 (consistent). Demand has clearly shifted up starting 2019-01-21 and recent periods (P4-P6) show higher, stable demand (~173-200). To capture the recent elevated regime I use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility (focus on latest 3 realized demands). Lead time set to calculate to confirm observed 4-period lead time. This balances service (higher recent mean) vs holding cost by sizing demand forecast to recent realized demand while using observed lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime (sustained since 2019-01-21) and the last 3 selling periods show high demand (Periods 5-7 demands = 181, 200, 268). On-hand=0, in-transit=667 (pipeline covers several incoming shipments). Observed concluded lead times for orders placed in Periods 1-3 are 4 periods each -> actual lead time confirmed as 4. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility (focus on Periods 5-7) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher demand; L is set by calculation of observed lead times (average=4). These settings help the OR backend raise the base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping holding cost in check by using only the recent regime sample for variance and mean.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand history shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21; recent in-regime samples = 61, 98, 152. To capture the post-shift demand level and recent volatility, set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the three most recent in-regime samples. This balances service (capture the new higher mean) against holding costs by limiting the sample window to the sustained new regime.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent demand is high and elevated vs earlier weeks (most recent demands P7-9 = 268, 376, 295). On-hand=0, in-transit=1115 (covers ~3.6 recent-week demands). Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period transit. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (uses P7-9 avg) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service (profit=holding so equal tradeoff) while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples and account for confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9 arrivals).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=1334; prior concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21. Pipeline (1334) covers several upcoming periods but demand has been high recent periods (e.g., P8 demand 376, P10 demand 367). I keep L as default (promised=4) because concluded history consistently shows 4. For mu_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to focus the forecast on the most recent elevated demand regime and avoid dilution by the two zero-demand early samples. Sigma_hat stays default to let the backend compute variability over full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher target stock to protect service during the sustained higher-demand regime while relying on pipeline coverage to limit new ordering and holding cost.

Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained spike: multi-week demands 129,213,175,173,181,200,268,376,295,367,477). On-hand=0, in-transit=1298 \u2014 pipeline is substantial but arrivals are observed with confirmed lead time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals P1->P5 ... P5->P9). I keep L at the promised value to match observed confirmation and OR assumptions. Demand forecast will use a recent-window to capture the post-changepoint higher mean; I choose recent_N with N=7 (captures the latest 7 demand observations to represent the new regime while avoiding overfit). Volatility similarly uses recent_N N=7 to reflect recent variability. These choices align base-stock to current high-demand regime and let the OR engine size orders while capping exposure via its built-in cap; with profit=holding, the backend will target ~50% service quantile but using recent demand stats increases service during the confirmed high-demand period.

LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = promised 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 with materially higher weekly demand since then. To keep service while limiting holding cost, use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the higher regime. Set L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the most recent high-demand weeks and avoid diluting with pre-shift zeros.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Recent periods show a sustained high-demand regime (multi-week demands well above early-sample zeros) and historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4. On-hand=96 and in-transit=1348 provide substantial pipeline but recent weekly demand has been large and variable; use recent data to size review+lead demand. Set L via calculate to lock to observed lead time average (confirmed =4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime (use last 5 demand samples to estimate mean and volatility across the (1+L) review+lead horizon). This balances service (avoid stockouts given large pipeline consumption) against holding cost by sizing to recent realized demand and variance rather than long-ago zero-demand samples.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift since 2019-01-21 (higher weekly demand) and multiple conclude messages confirming actual lead time = promised 4 periods. Current stock: on-hand=85, in-transit=1437 (pipeline ample vs demand). Given confirmed LT=4 and large pipeline, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This avoids overfitting to short-term noise while respecting the confirmed LT and letting the capped policy limit order size despite high pipeline. No evidence of lost shipments or new regime beyond what's already recorded.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=1265; historical concludes consistently show actual lead time=4. Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 5 (sustained elevated weekly demand across 11+ periods). To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 11 demand observations so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new mean/volatility. Using default L (promised lead time=4) leverages confirmed lead-time evidence; recent_N for demand lets OR compute base_stock that balances $1 profit vs $1 holding cost given the elevated demand. The in-transit stock (1265) will be compared to the (1+L)-period demand forecast produced by mu_hat to determine ordering under the capped policy.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Observed sustained high demand since the Jan 21 regime shift; recent weeks show volatile but elevated weekly demand (Periods 11-16 = [477,468,332,417,370,525]). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To capture the recent elevated regime while smoothing noise, I set L to promised (default=4) and use recent_N (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most relevant recent samples.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has settled above early zero baseline; last 5 weekly demands = [332,417,370,525,330], recent mean \u2248 394.8/wk. On-hand=192, in-transit=1486 => pipeline+on-hand=1678, which is below (1+L)*recent_mean (\u22481974) so pipeline likely insufficient to cover review+lead demand. No evidence of lost shipments; observed lead time confirmed as 4 in prior periods. I choose L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect the new higher demand regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility and not dilute with old zero-demand samples. These settings make the OR engine size base-stock to meet the elevated recent demand while using recent variability for safety stock.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent realized demand is substantially higher than the Jan baseline (sustained high weekly demand ~300\u2013525 over many recent periods). On-hand=385, in-transit=1287 (healthy pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To capture the recent high-demand regime, use recent_N for demand mean and volatility based on the most recent periods. L set to default (promised 4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=9 (captures recent ~9-week high-demand regime while satisfying N>=3 and <=20). This raises the base stock to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while sigma reflects recent variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given high pipeline.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demand is well above the historical Jan baseline (sustained regime shift noted 2019-01-21). On-hand=0, in-transit=1609 units (~3.9 recent-periods of demand), which is short of covering (1+L)=5 periods given elevated demand \u2014 risk of stockouts unless base stock is raised. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods, so keep promised L. I use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current high-demand regime (last 6 demand observations) so the backend raises target inventory to cover the elevated mean and volatility, balancing the $1 profit vs $1 holding cost by using recent demand statistics.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=1611. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time (P1->P5 ... P16->P20), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has moved to a higher summer regime: last 5 demands (P16-P20) = [525,330,302,517,771], avg=489 units/week. To capture this regime while limiting noise, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (backend will scale by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)). This ensures pipeline targets ~5-week coverage of the elevated mean while reflecting recent volatility; with profit=holding equal, this balances service vs holding given large in-transit position.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand has been high and volatile with sustained elevated regime since 2019-01-21; on-hand=0, in-transit=1859 (large pipeline). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use default promised L to align OR engine assumptions. To capture the recent high-demand regime and volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (uses the most recent 8 demand samples to reflect the current faster-moving regime while respecting the N selection rules). This balances higher service-level needs against holding cost given a large in-transit position (pipeline will be accounted by OR engine when computing final order).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Demand has been in the elevated regime since 2019-01-21 with sustained high weekly demand (many periods with demand >300). On-hand=0, in-transit=2094 \u2014 pipeline is large and will cover multiple upcoming weeks given L=4. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To keep the OR engine responsive to the elevated recent demand, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat based on the most recent 8 demand samples (captures current season/regime) while keeping L and sigma_hat at defaults so the backend uses promised lead time and full-sample volatility scaling. This balances service (capture recent high mean) against holding cost given the already-large pipeline.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): on-hand=0, in-transit=2147. Historical concludes strongly confirm actual lead time=4. Demand has been in a higher regime since late May\u2014recent 5-week demands: 517, 771, 592, 542, 510 (avg=586.4). To align ordering with the current high-demand regime and the confirmed 4-period lead time, I use default L (promised=4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N (N=5) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, keeping orders responsive to the sustained elevated demand while capping order size via the backend cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-07-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=2470. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time=4 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 with much higher weekly demand since. To prioritize service (profit=holding cost), keep promised lead time (default). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained high-demand regime while smoothing short noise using the last 20 samples. This biases base-stock up to cover (1+L) demand under the new regime given large pipeline, balancing stockouts vs holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand has been well above early-year levels (summer spike): last 6 demands = [771,592,542,510,710,309], average ~572. Channel shows confirmed lead time = 4 historically. On-hand=490 + in-transit=1671 provides a large pipeline, but demand remains elevated so I bias forecasts to recent weeks. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher summer regime (changepoint established earlier at Period 1 and recent elevated means); N=6 chosen as the most recent regime sample length (capped by availability). These parameters direct the OR engine to target base stock tuned to current high demand while sigma from recent variability tightens safety stock to avoid excess holding.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Demand showed a sustained regime shift back in Jan (higher weekly demand since 2019-01-21) and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. Current inventory is high: on-hand=845, in-transit=1841, so pipeline comfortably covers multiple review+lead periods. To avoid excess ordering given large pipeline, keep lead time as promised and use default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps orders conservative while the backend caps order size.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Demand showed a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (3+ periods of elevated demand) and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. Current on-hand=1088 and in-transit=1466 (large pipeline). Recent weeks show a softening from earlier peak (period demands: P22-27 = 542,510,710,309,176,132). To reflect current demand level while keeping safety for 4-period lead + review (5 periods), I use L=default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the latest regime including the recent downshift; N=6 is chosen because the most recent 6 concluded demands show the new short-term mean/volatility and N falls within the regime detection rules. This reduces over-ordering versus using long-run averages while preserving service through the 5-period coverage window given sizable on-hand + pipeline.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=1698, in-transit=701. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time=4; use promised/default L to remain consistent with observed arrivals. Recent demand has fallen from the spring peak \u2014 last several periods (P25\u2013P28) demands = [309,176,132,155] and the recent rolling regime looks lower and more stable than the early-season surge. To capture the recent lower regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples. This biases the base-stock toward current lower demand while keeping safety from recent variability. Methods chosen: L=default to reflect confirmed 4-period behavior; mu_hat=recent_N to adapt to the recent lower-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N to reflect recent volatility for safety.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Current on-hand=1559, in-transit=701. Historical arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (sustained P1->P5 ... P5->P9). Recent demand has declined from earlier summer peaks; last 6 weeks (Periods 24-29 demands = 710,309,176,132,155,139) show a lower recent mean vs summer spike. To avoid overstock given holding cost = profit, use promised lead time (default) and a recent_N demand estimate (N=6) to reflect the post-peak regime.

To avoid further buildup given high on-hand and equal profit/holding (q=0.5 -> conservative stocking), use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend will compute base_stock from full-sample mean.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has fallen sharply from summer peaks to low weekly sales (Periods 29-32 = 139,78,65,30), suggesting a new low-demand regime. On-hand = 2087, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample stock today, no immediate arrivals expected. Lead time historically confirmed as 4; keep default. For demand forecast I use a recent-window estimate to capture the post-summer drop: recent_N with N=4 (Periods 29-32) to avoid inflating orders with older peak-season data. Use the same recent_N=4 for sigma to reflect lower recent volatility. This keeps base-stock modest relative to current low demand while avoiding large replenishments given high on-hand inventory, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Lead time previously confirmed at 4 periods; no new late/missing arrivals observed. I use promised/default lead time to keep OR backend aligned with confirmed history. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current low-demand regime (last 5 weeks) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock and safety stock reflect the reduced mean and volatility, limiting excess holding costs while preserving service.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has fallen from summer peaks to ~low-70s/week (last 7 demands: 139,78,65,30,35,62,38 \u2192 avg \u2248 66). On-hand is high (1952) and in-transit=0; no overdue shipments observed in concluded history and lead time has been consistently 4. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting near-term demand, keep promised L and base the forecast on the most recent 7 weeks to capture the current low-demand regime. Methods chosen: L=default (promised=4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=7 to scale (1+L)\xd7recent mean, sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has settled at a low summer->fall level: periods 29\u201336 demands = [139,78,65,30,35,62,38,43] (sustained low regime of 8 weeks). On-hand=1909, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock now vs current weekly demand (~50/wk). Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4; no new evidence of change. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (4). For demand I target the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=8 (regime length=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts using the current lower mean and volatility, avoiding excess future replenishment while current on-hand buffers service.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=1859, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently confirm lead time=4; use promised/default L to match backend. Recent demand has fallen and stabilized since Period 29 (periods 29\u201337: 139,78,65,30,35,62,38,43,50) \u2014 treat this as a new low-demand regime (length=9).

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=1823, in-transit=0. Recent demand has dropped and stabilized since Period 29 (sustained low demand for ~10 periods, recent avg ~57.6/week) after a high-summer peak (prior avg ~433/week). Promised lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 in history; use default promised L. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 10 observed demand samples (Periods 29\u201338). This keeps the base-stock aligned with current low demand and avoids excess holding cost given profit=holding. The recent_N choice (N=10) captures the new regime length (10 periods) while remaining >=3 and <=20.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: recent 10-period avg = 57.6 units/week vs prior 9-period avg = 433 units/week (\u221286.7%).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11): demand has been in a low regime since Period 29 (recent weekly demands ~34\u201378). On-hand is high (1789) and no in-transit stock. Promised lead time=4 and historical concludes confirm L=4 earlier; use default promised lead time to keep OR engine aligned. To avoid excess holding cost given the sustained low-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data from the low-demand regime: recent_N with N=11 (regime length Period29\u201339 = 11 periods) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and variability rather than being pulled up by prior high-summer demand. This reduces target base stock and caps orders, protecting profit vs. holding cost tradeoff.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=1747, in-transit=0. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 in concluded history. Demand dropped sharply starting around Period 29 and has stayed low (~30\u201378/week); recent 10-period average ~57.6 units/week (carry-over noted). With very high on-hand inventory versus current demand, keep promised lead time and base demand/volatility estimates focused on the recent low-demand regime to avoid overordering. Set L=default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower post-changepoint demand and reduced variability.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=1730, in-transit=0. Demand has been in the low regime since Period 29 (sustained low weekly demand: recent weeks mostly 17\u201362). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in prior concludes. To avoid overstocking while preserving service, keep promised L and set demand forecasts using the low-demand recent regime (use last 13 weeks since Period 29\u219241, regime length=13). This reduces mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current low-volume regime and prevents the OR engine from ordering aggressively against older high-demand data.

To align targets with the sustained lower demand and avoid excess holding cost, set lead time to promised (default) and base-stock forecast using the recent 10-week regime. Use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders to the current low-demand variability; with profit=holding, service quantile is 0.5 (z*=0) so mu_hat will directly set the target.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and demand regime shift downwards around Period 29; recent demand has been low and stable (many weeks ~30\u2013113, recent mean ~50s). I set L=default (use promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=16 to capture the post-changepoint regime (16 recent periods since Period 29) so the OR backend will size base-stock to current lower demand and reflect recent volatility, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=1394, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 29 (post-summer drop): avg of recent regime ~57.6/week vs prior high volumes; confirmed over 18 weeks (Periods 29\u201346). Lead time has been observed as 4 periods historically and no new late arrivals are pending. I keep L as default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms L=4. To align the base-stock to the low-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand over (1+L) periods using the 18-week post-changepoint samples; this reduces over-ordering vs using full-history averages and accounts for current lower mean/volatility. No explicit adjustments for missing shipments are needed since there are none in-transit and arrivals historically matched promised LT.
