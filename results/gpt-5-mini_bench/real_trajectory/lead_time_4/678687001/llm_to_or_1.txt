Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 678687001 (sports bra). Profit $19, holding $1. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Historical weekly samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~111 units/week; with promised L=4, use full-sample defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (high profit) vs holding cost by relying on full-sample demand stats and promised lead time.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent weekly demand samples (118,136,104,95,103) show stable ~111 mean. On-hand=0, in-transit=138 (Period1 order not yet concluded), so no confirmed lead-time change\u2014single non-arrival is insufficient. Use promised lead time to avoid overreacting. Set L=default to keep backend's promised 4-period lead time. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples, providing a balanced base-stock that covers review+lead demand while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent historical weekly demand mean = 111.2 (samples: 118,136,104,95,103). On-hand=0, in-transit=273 which covers ~2.45 weeks of demand but the policy must cover (1+L)=5 periods; promised lead time is 4 so I retain the promised lead time. No concluded arrivals yet so do not infer lead-time change or lost shipments. Use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of regime change.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean \u2248111 units/week (samples: 118,136,104,95,103). On-hand = 0, in-transit = 418. Promised lead time = 4; no concluded arrivals yet so no evidence of lead-time shifts or lost shipments. (1+L)=5 periods demand \u22485\xd7111=~556 units, so current pipeline (418) is likely insufficient -> we should keep backend using default demand estimates so it orders to top up. Therefore use default lead time and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so OR engine computes base stock from full-sample mean/variance and compensates for the pipeline shortfall.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=561 which equals sum of orders from P1\u2013P4 (138+135+145+143). Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer a different actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean \u2248111.2. I use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand volatility to let the OR engine compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean + safety buffer using profit/holding; this keeps parameters aligned with historical demand while awaiting arrival confirmation and avoids over-adjusting for unconfirmed lead-time shifts.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean ~111.2. On-hand=20, in-transit=491. Observed one concluded arrival: Period 5 conclude shows order from Period 1 arrived with lead_time=4 (consistent with promised L=4). Orders placed in Periods 2-4 are still within the promised 4-period window and not yet concluded. No sustained changepoint in demand or lead time detected. I select L by calculating average observed lead times to let the backend confirm (method=calculate). For demand I use the default aggregate rule (method=default) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) capturing review+lead demand. For volatility I use the default (method=default) so sigma_hat reflects sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). These conservative settings supply the OR engine with the historical mean over the full sample while relying on observed lead-time evidence, balancing service level (profit) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Recent concluded arrivals show orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5 and P2\u2192arrived P6, confirming actual lead time \u22484. Demand history (samples mean=111.2/wk) and current inventory: on-hand=55, in-transit=473 (pipeline=528). Pipeline + on-hand is slightly below (1+L)*mean demand (\u2248556), so maintain default demand sizing; use observed lead-time average to let backend compute appropriate base-stock. Methods chosen: infer L from observed arrivals, use default mu and sigma (backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from samples) so the OR engine balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order P1 arrived P5, order P2 arrived P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods (from Period 7 conclude). Current on-hand=77, in-transit=421 -> pipeline+on-hand=498 units. Using default methods keeps L aligned with promised/confirmed lead time and uses full historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) to compute demand across the (1+L)=5 period review+lead window. This produces a baseline mu_hat that targets mean demand over the review+lead horizon while sigma_hat (default) reflects historical variability scaled for the review+lead horizon. Given confirmed on-time arrivals and no recent demand regime change, defaults balance service level vs holding cost without overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent week (Period 8) demand spiked to 182 vs historical sample mean 111.2; on-hand 38 + in-transit 403 = 441 units which is below (1+L)*mean = 5*111.2 = 556, indicating a shortfall across the review+lead horizon. Observed lead times in concluded history are consistently 4 periods, so use promised/default lead time. Use default demand scaling (all samples) so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from full-sample mean/variance; this balances service level\u2014allowing the optimizer to raise orders to cover the 5-period demand window\u2014while sigma default captures historical variability. No new sustained pattern beyond the confirmed L=4 is being recorded here.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). Current inventory: on-hand=5, in-transit=493 \u2192 pipeline=498 units. Historical weekly demand mean \u2248111.2; (1+L)*mean \u22485*111.2=556 units demand over review+lead. Pipeline (498) < expected coverage (\u2248556), so risk of stockouts in the next L+1 periods. I select L=calculate to lock in the empirically observed 4-period lead time for forecasting. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, leveraging the full historical sample set and the confirmed lead time. This balances service level (by recognizing the confirmed 4-period lead time) against holding cost while letting the capped policy limit excessive orders given observed variability.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent on-hand=37, in-transit=532 (total pipeline=569). Recent demand (Periods 5-10) = [118,100,123,182,101,85], recent mean \u2248118.2/week. Carry-over confirmed lead time = 4 periods (stable arrivals P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Pipeline (569) is slightly below (1+L)*recent_mean \u22485*118.2=591, so we want the OR engine to target the recent demand regime to avoid stockouts given elevated mid-March/early-April demand (notably 182). I set L to default (promised 4) consistent with confirmed evidence; mu_hat uses recent_N with N=6 to capture the shifted recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=6 to capture recent volatility (including the 182 spike). These choices steer the backend base-stock toward higher coverage of current demand while letting the capped order constraint limit extreme ordering.

Period 12 (2019-04-29). SKU 678687001 (sports bra). Profit $19, holding $1. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so I set L via calculate to use observed lead times. On-hand 31 + in-transit 587 = 618 units, which covers ~618/5 = 123.6 units/period over the (1+L)=5 period review+lead window \u2014 slightly above the long-run sample mean (~111), so pipeline is healthy. I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses all historical samples (no short-term regime detected) to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level vs holding cost given strong pipeline and confirmed lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concludes show consistent arrivals with actual lead time = 4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6 etc.). On-hand=63, in-transit=503 -> ample pipeline. Demand history (samples) mean \u2248111.2/wk; with promised L=4 I use the default calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. Using defaults keeps parameters aligned with confirmed lead time and historical demand while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise; this balances service level (profit $19) versus low holding cost ($1). No explicit adjustments for lost shipments are needed (arrivals have been consistent).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6 etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=142, in-transit=431 => pipeline+on-hand=573 units, which modestly exceeds (1+L)-period demand based on historical sample mean. I therefore use the default promised lead time (L=4) and default demand statistics (mu_hat and sigma_hat) computed from all historical samples so the OR backend applies the standard (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std treatment. This keeps parameters aligned with confirmed lead time, avoids overfitting to short-term noise, and lets the capped ordering rule control order sizing to balance the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand=206 + in-transit=348 = 554 units, which approximately equals (1+L)\xd7historical mean demand (5\xd7111.2\u2248556), so pipeline coverage is adequate but not excessive given profit/holding tradeoff. I will use the promised/default lead time and default demand stats (no clear recent demand regime shift requiring recent_N or EWMA). These parameters balance service level (cover ~5 weeks demand given L=4) against holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=259, in-transit=285 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=544 units. Historical weekly sample mean=111.2 (samples: 118,136,104,95,103). Promised lead time=4 and prior concluded messages confirm actual lead time=4. I choose L=default to use promised lead time (matches observed). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this yields a 5-period forecast anchored on historical mean (\u2248556 units) and preserves the engine's capped ordering behavior. Given current pipeline (544\u2248556) we are near target while avoiding excess holding cost; using defaults is appropriate since demand appears stable and lead time is confirmed.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P12\u2192P16), confirming actual lead time\u22484 and no signs of lost shipments. On-hand=203 + in-transit=334 = 537 units vs. default (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples)=5\xd7111.2=556 target \u2192 small shortfall (~19 units). I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L), keeping service level aligned to profit/holding tradeoff while avoiding overfitting to recent volatility.

No evidence of a new demand regime or lost shipments in the concluded history, so keep defaults.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed previously). On-hand=175 + in-transit=348 = 523 units currently in system. Base demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) mean=111.2/wk; using promised lead time L=4 is consistent with observed arrivals. I choose default methods so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasting anchored to historical baseline while the pipeline (523 units) already covers multiple weeks of expected demand. Using defaults avoids overfitting to short-term noise and leverages confirmed lead-time observation.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent weekly demand has declined vs. Jan samples (last 5 observed demands: 72,67,50,25,37 -> avg \u224850). On-hand=370, in-transit=200 => pipeline=570 units, which already covers ~5 weeks of recent demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I select default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses long-run sample statistics (which yield base_stock \u2248 current pipeline), avoiding aggressive replenishment while honoring the confirmed LT=4.

LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/07/29. Summer demand has fallen vs. spring (recent demands P15-P24: 95,97,86,101,72,67,50,25,37,35 show sustained lower mean). On-hand=402 + in-transit=165 provides ample cover vs. (1+L) periods but we must reduce forecast to match the new summer regime. Keep L as promised (default) since lead time has been confirmed historically as 4. Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest lower-demand regime (N=10 covers P15\u2013P24), reducing safety stock and holding cost exposure while preserving service.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent weekly demand has dropped sharply into summer: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 21-25) = [50, 25, 37, 35, 13] (mean \u2248 32). On-hand=451 and in-transit=103 \u2014 inventory is high relative to current low demand. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods; keep promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime, set demand forecast using the most recent 5 periods (captures the summer trough) and match sigma to recent volatility. This reduces ordering targets to avoid excess holding cost while keeping service.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has dropped sharply vs. spring: on-hand=473, in-transit=56 (pipeline covers some upcoming demand). Lead time has been consistently 4 (confirmed historically). I treat the recent low-demand regime (Periods 21-26, avg \u224830.8 units/week) as the current forecast basis to avoid overstock. Therefore use L=default (promised=4), mu_hat based on recent_N (N=6) to capture this new low-demand regime, and sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent lower volatility. This balances higher service with much lower holding cost sensitivity given the sustained demand decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 21: avg demand fell from ~99.4 (Periods 5-20) to ~30.8 (Periods 21-26), a ~69% decrease (sustained for 6 periods).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 21 (mean ~30.8/week) and confirmed actual lead time=4 (multiple observed arrivals at 4). Current inventory: on-hand=461, in-transit=32 (pipeline=493). With low recent weekly demand (~31) and long review+lead horizon (1+L periods =5), I choose L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time=4; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 (regime length from Periods 21\u201327 = 7) so the OR backend computes demand over the review+lead window from recent low-demand samples. This keeps target base-stock aligned to the new lower demand while the large on-hand+pipeline provides coverage; using recent_N reduces risk of overstock while sigma from recent volatility tightens order caps.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=449, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 21 (recent weekly demand ~13\u201344, mean \u224830.6 over last 5). To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and low recent demand, use promised/default lead time and base forecasts on the most recent regime. Set L=default (promised 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture current low-demand regime (backend will apply (1+L) multiplier). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces ordering to match the new lower demand while preserving service given current inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Demand has fallen sharply since Period 21 and recent weeks remain low; on-hand = 404, in-transit = 0, so no immediate replenishment needed. Lead time was previously confirmed at 4 periods; I keep promised/default lead time. To avoid building more excess inventory given the sustained lower-demand regime, I set demand forecasts using recent data (most recent 5 weeks) so the OR engine will target much smaller replenishment. sigma also based on the same recent window to reflect lower variability.

Use promised lead time (4). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) should use the recent low-demand regime: apply recent_N with N=10 (Periods 21-30) to capture the new mean/variance and avoid over-ordering while satisfying service. These parameters balance service vs holding cost given the sustained ~69% demand decrease.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime since Period 21 (periods 21-31 mean \u224833.4 units/week). On-hand=347, in-transit=0 => ample stock vs current demand (risk: holding cost). Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods; no new evidence of change and recent orders are not arriving (no in-transit). I set L to default (promised=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (regime length 21\u201331 = 11 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 11 samples, capturing the lower demand level and avoiding overweighting older high-demand history. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices lower target base stock to reduce holding cost while preserving service for the new low-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=327, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P1\u2192P5..P4\u2192P8 observations) and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 21 (avg ~30.8 since P21 vs ~99.4 before). No overdue arrivals visible. To respect confirmed lead time I let the engine calculate L from observations (will equal 4). For demand I use recent_N over the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201332, 12 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new, lower mean/volatility and avoid over-ordering against the old higher-demand regime. This keeps base-stock aligned to current demand and reduces holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand remains in the low regime established at Period 21 (~31 avg); last 13 demands (P21\u2013P33) average low and supply shows no in-transit units (on-hand=281, in-transit=0) and several recent orders did not arrive suggesting lost shipments but lead time has been previously confirmed as 4. I keep L at the promised/default (4) to align with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (captures current mean and volatility) so the optimizer reduces replenishment and holding costs while preserving service. This choice accounts for missing arrivals by relying on observed concluded arrivals and recent low-demand data rather than older high-demand history.

Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 21 (sustained drop), on-hand = 257, in-transit = 0, and no arrivals observed since Period 28 (implying no outstanding pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. Given large on-hand stock and low recent demand, I will keep the promised lead time and use default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine uses the full historical sample set; this avoids unnecessary explicit adjustments while letting the backend cap orders given current high inventory and holding cost tradeoff.

On-hand=238 + in-transit=146 = 384 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time (all concluded lead times = 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the low-demand regime since the changepoint at Period 21 (regime length ~15 up to current), giving the OR engine a forecast that reflects the sustained drop. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=15 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base stock small relative to the old high-demand regime, avoiding excess holding cost while preserving service for the current low-demand regime.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand regime remains the low regime identified at Period 21. On-hand=218, in-transit=146 (total pipeline+on-hand=364) which covers ~5 periods of demand at current rates. I computed recent demand over Periods 21-36 (16 weeks): total demand=496, mean=31.0/week. Promised lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods and remains supported by concluded arrivals. To keep safety-sizing aligned with the sustained lower-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=16 (full low-demand regime length) so the backend will scale (1+L)*mean using current regime data. L remains default (promised=4) because concluded history continues to show 4-period arrivals and no new lead-time loss pattern. This balances service (use recent low mean to avoid overstock) vs. holding cost given high on-hand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). Recent demand is in the lower regime identified at Period 21 (sustained lower mean ~31). On-hand=164, in-transit=146 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand covers many weeks so we should not chase high forecasts. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 periods. I set L=default to use promised (and confirmed) 4. I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint regime; chosen N=17 covers the ~17-period low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201337) to produce (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on recent behaviour, reducing overstock risk while maintaining service.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=127, in-transit=146. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 21 (avg fell ~69%). Pipeline plus on-hand currently adequate for several weeks of low demand, but we must size future orders to the lower-demand regime to avoid holding cost. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time from concluded history (matches confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent low-demand regime (last 10 weeks) so base-stock targets and caps reflect current lower mean and variability, reducing excess inventory and holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has remained in the low regime confirmed at Period 27 (avg ~30.8 since P21). On-hand=227, in-transit=0 \u2014 on-hand alone covers many weeks at current low demand so urgent ordering not needed. Use promised lead time (4). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to focus on the post-changepoint low-demand regime and capture latest mean; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock aligned to current low demand and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service through the 5-period review+lead window.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand has been in the low regime confirmed at Period 21 (avg ~31 vs ~99 prior) and has persisted through recent weeks (demands mostly 19\u201354). On-hand=198, in-transit=7 \u2014 ample coverage vs current low demand. No new arrivals overdue (recent P35 arrival at P39 confirms lead time still 4). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service in the sustained low-demand regime, set L to promised (default) and estimate demand using recent data. I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the most recent 10 demand observations (focus on the low regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend reduces target base stock to reflect lower mean and lower variability, balancing profit-driven service level against $1/unit holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Demand has been in the lower post-changepoint regime (sharp drop around Period 21) for many periods; on-hand=172, in-transit=11 so pipeline is healthy vs recent weekly demand (~20-50). Lead time has been confirmed historically as 4 periods. I use L=default (promised 4) to keep OR engine aligned with supplier promise. For demand parameters I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained low-demand regime (large sample since Period 21) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current mean/volatility and reduce ordering for the lower demand period. This balances service (avoid stockouts) with holding cost by shrinking forecast to the recent regime rather than the high-demand past.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=36, in-transit=29. Historical concludes confirm lead time=4 (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals including P35\u2192P39); no evidence of new lead-time change or lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 36-42 = [20,54,37,46,29,26,136]) shows low baseline with one large spike (Period 42 likely promotional/Black Friday). To balance service vs. holding cost I use a short recent window to capture the current low-demand regime but allow the OR engine to account for variability through its z-safety logic. Therefore: L=default (promised 4); mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 (most recent 7 demand samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean_recent and sqrt(1+L)*std_recent respectively.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). Demand has been in the low regime since Period 21 (confirmed earlier). On-hand=18 + in-transit=145 => pipeline covers several weeks but no new arrivals visible yet. Lead time has been previously confirmed at 4 periods; I will use the default promised lead time to match that. To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime since Period 21, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent low-demand regime while smoothing occasional spikes). This biases orders down to avoid holding cost while preserving service level under the OR backend's capped policy.

Demand has been in the lower regime since Period 21 (sustained drop), so I bias forecasts to recent demand rather than full-history means. I set L=default to keep promised lead time (4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to capture the post-changepoint demand regime while smoothing short outliers (e.g., Period 42 spike). This balances service (avoid stockouts given pipeline) against holding cost by focusing the base stock on recent lower demand levels.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=274. Historical lead times continue to show 4-period arrivals (confirmed multiple times); use promised/default lead time. Recent demand is volatile with a large holiday spike (Period 45 demand=409) and other moderate spikes (P42=136). To emphasize recent behavior while still smoothing noise, set mu_hat using EWMA (gamma=0.5) so the OR backend weights recent high demand more heavily for the (1+L) review+lead window. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility without overfitting to a single outlier. This balances service level (high profit/higher q=0.95) against holding cost by increasing forecasted base stock moderately but using empirical recent volatility for the cap calculation.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=755. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. Recent demand shows a sharp but brief holiday spike (Periods 45-46: 409, 338) above the low summer regime; to respond to the immediate elevated demand while keeping safety stock high (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95), I use the promised/default lead time and set demand forecast from the most recent 8 periods to capture the holiday surge. I also estimate volatility from the same recent 8 periods so the OR engine raises base stock for high service during the spike but uses observed recent variance.
