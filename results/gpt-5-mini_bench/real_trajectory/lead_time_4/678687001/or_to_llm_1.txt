OR computed a capped single-period order of ~138 (matches OR recommendation) by capping base-stock replenishment to ~\u03bc\u0304+1.645\u03c3\u0304. Reality check: on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals exist to indicate a shorter lead time or existing pipeline. Because orders placed now are considered pipeline (they will arrive after L periods), to cover the (L+1)=5-period demand the pipeline+on-hand must approximate \u03bc\u0302. OR's 138 would leave pipeline far below the 5-period demand (556) given current zero pipeline and on-hand, risking large foregone sales when arrivals finally occur.

Recent history shows a single extreme spike (Period 45 demand=409) but no sustained multi-period increase, so treat it as a short holiday surge rather than a new regime. Still, pipeline (225) plus OR's 182 would roughly cover a very large single-week surge (~407 units) when those in-transit orders arrive; given current date (2019-12-23) holiday demand risk is elevated, so I increase OR slightly to improve coverage over the next (L+1)=5 weeks while keeping holding cost low.
