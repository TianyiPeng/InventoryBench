Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is ladies denim trousers with historical weekly samples (82,35,31,48,55). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals; no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time shifts yet. Use promised lead time (default) = 4. Demand forecast use all samples (no recent changepoint): mu_hat default -> (1+L)*mean(all samples). Volatility likewise use all samples: sigma_hat default -> sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (covering L+1 periods of typical weekly demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand mean ~50 units (samples from 2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04). Promised lead time is 4 periods and no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 order of 84 has arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude), so actual lead time not yet observed. On-hand=0, in-transit=84 which is well below (1+L)\xd7mean demand (~5\xd750\u2248250), so pipeline is currently insufficient to cover the review+lead horizon. Using default lead time and default demand estimates lets the OR backend apply the base-stock calculation with the provided profit/holding costs to balance service level vs holding cost; this avoids overfitting to a single late arrival while allowing the engine to compute the required replenishment.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples (82,35,31,48,55) give mean\u224850.2. Promised lead time=4 and we have no concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1/P2 have not concluded), so cannot infer a lead-time change or lost shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=167 (sufficient pipeline cover). Use default lead time and default demand estimates to let the OR engine compute base-stock from full-sample stats; this balances service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of regime shift.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~50.2 units. Promised lead time = 4 periods; we have 0 concluded arrivals so far (in-transit = 287 from prior orders). No concluded arrivals => cannot infer actual lead time; shipments may still be en route. To avoid overreacting to missing conclude messages and since no sustained changepoint in demand is evident, use default lead time and demand estimates based on all samples. This keeps the OR backend's base-stock anchored to historical mean while the cap prevents excessive single-period orders given pipeline inventory.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has been strong and variable (period demands: 61,130,104,86; prior historical weeks: 82,35,31,48,55). On-hand=0, in-transit=407 (orders from P1\u2013P4). Promised lead time=4; no concluded arrivals yet so no confirmed lead-time change or lost shipments (orders placed in P1 would only conclude in P6). Use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend applies its full-sample mean/std across the (1+L) horizon. This balances service level given high recent demand while avoiding premature explicit inflation of forecasts before arrivals conclude.

Daily Reward (R_t): $336.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized weekly demand (Periods1-5) = [61,130,104,86,85], mean=93.2, substantially above historical sample mean (50.2). Pipeline shows in-transit=330 (matches orders placed in P1-P4 of 84+83+120+43? actually orders in history sum to 84+83+120+120+7 = 414, but concluded arrivals confirm some; current in-transit value is authoritative). One concluded arrival (Period5 conclude) shows an order placed in Period1 arrived with lead_time=4, so observed lead time = 4. I set L using 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times average. Demand forecast (mu_hat) uses recent_N with N=5 to capture the new, higher-demand regime (use (1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples). Volatility (sigma_hat) uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent variability. These choices ensure the OR backend raises base-stock to service the sustained higher demand while accounting for observed lead time and recent demand volatility; this balances service-level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost given large pipeline and zero on-hand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period5 conclude: arrived=84 units ordered on Period1, lead_time=4); Demand regime shift over Periods1-5: recent mean=93.2 vs historical sample mean=50.2 (+85%), sustained for 5 periods

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=4, in-transit=383. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period5 conclude: arrival from P1 with L=4) and recent elevated demand (recent mean over last 5 periods = 93.2 vs historical mean 50.2). To reflect the confirmed lead time, keep L as promised (default). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 samples). Use recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings increase the (1+L)-period demand forecast and variability used by the OR backend so orders will cover the higher sustained demand while the capped ordering will still limit excessive arrivals and holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Demand has shifted up and remained elevated across recent periods (sustained high weekly demand, e.g., recent weeks: 61,130,104,86,85,79,179). On-hand=0, in-transit=394 \u2014 pipeline large but arrivals have historically taken 4 periods. Lead time confirmed at 4 periods from concluded arrivals; use calculated lead time. Forecast demand using recent data to capture the sustained higher regime; use recent_N=7 to cover all recent observed weeks. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters ensure the OR engine sets a higher base stock matching the new demand regime while respecting pipeline inventory to avoid excess holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent realized demand is well above historical sample mean (sustained elevated regime: recent avg ~93 over 5 periods) and actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 in concluded history. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=443 (covers multiple future periods). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime rather than the older low historical mean. Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices push the backend to target a higher base stock (covering the elevated demand over the review+lead window) while using recent volatility to size safety stock so service improves without excessive holding beyond what recent data justify.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=626. Historical sample mean=50.2 (five Jan/Feb samples) but recent periods (P1\u2013P9) show a sustained higher-demand regime (recent mean \u224893.2 over last 5 concluded periods). Lead-time evidence from conclude messages consistently shows 4 periods (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9 all have lead_time=4). Given confirmed L=4 and a clear demand upshift sustained for 5 periods, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and forecast demand using the most recent regime (to avoid understocking). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the elevated mean and volatility; this raises the (1+L) demand forecast and uncertainty so the OR backend will target higher base-stock while capping orders per its cap rule. This balances higher service (avoid stockouts during the new regime) against holding cost because cap limits extreme over-ordering.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent history shows consistent observed lead times of 4 periods (orders placed P1-P6 arrived after 4 periods) and sustained higher demand vs the historical sample. On-hand=62, in-transit=528 (pipeline is large). I set L via observed data (calculate) to let the OR backend use confirmed lead-time evidence. For demand I choose default aggregation so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = default to capture overall historical volatility across the full sample, which matches the backend's estimation method and avoids overreacting to short-term spikes given the substantial pipeline. These parameters balance service level (use confirmed L to cover true lead time) against holding cost (default mu/sigma avoid overstating demand when pipeline is already high).

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 Period12. Confirmed actual lead time = 4 (observed repeatedly). Recent demand is elevated vs historical: last 11-period mean \u2248108.5 units/week (1194 total over 11 weeks), well above historical sample mean 50.2. On-hand=33 + in-transit=397 = 430 units currently in pipeline; with L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods so recent demand*(1+L) \u2248 5*108.5 \u2248 543 units \u2014 pipeline is below that, so we should target the higher recent-demand regime. Therefore: set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime. This raises the base-stock to meet elevated demand while sigma from recent_N captures current volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-05-06: Recent demand has been well above historical sample mean (sustained high demand since Period1), and concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4. On-hand=74 + in-transit=402 provides ample pipeline but demand remains elevated, so use recent-data estimates to capture higher mean/volatility. L set to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time from concluded arrivals. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=8 (last 8 demand observations cover Period5\u2013Period12) to reflect the persistent higher-demand regime and increased variability; this balances higher service level needs against holding cost given current ample pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=147, in-transit=398 (sufficient pipeline). Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 periods (orders placed P1..P9 arrived after 4), so set L by observed average. Demand has risen vs original 5-sample baseline (13-period mean \u2248110.7 vs historical 50.2); to let OR backend compute demand across review+lead using full history, use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances higher recent demand with the backend's capped ordering rule and the known lead time.

Concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P conclude messages). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime across recent periods (gives (1+L)-scaled mean over the latest 10 demand observations), and sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep base-stock responsive to the elevated regime while the cap prevents excessive single-period replenishment, balancing service level (profit) against holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=0, in-transit=549. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time; recent demand (Periods 11-15) averaged \u2248140.6 units/week. Pipeline (549) covers ~3.9 weeks of recent demand but on-hand is zero so risk of stockout if shipments delayed or lost. Choose L=calculate to lock in observed lead time (average of concluded lead times \u22484). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the new, sustained higher-demand regime (recent mean \u2248140.6 \u2192 (1+L) scaling handled by backend). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility rather than long-run samples. These settings prioritize service (higher mu_hat) given clear sustained demand increase while using recent volatility to avoid overstocking.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Historical concluded data shows actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals at L=4) and a sustained higher-demand regime vs the original 5-sample historical mean. On-hand=61, in-transit=545 (pipeline total=606) which covers multiple future periods, but demand remains elevated so use a recent-window demand estimate. I set L to calculate to let the backend use observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I choose recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime from recent periods (last 10 concluded demands show elevated mean/volatility vs original sample set). These parameters bias the base-stock up to maintain service while the sigma estimate supports safety stock; using recent data avoids underordering from outdated low historical samples.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand regime (Periods 1-5 and sustained through later periods) has mean \u224893.2/week, higher than historical sample mean 50.2. On-hand (157) + in-transit (468) = 625 units, which covers ~5 periods of demand at recent mean (5\xd793.2=466), so pipeline is adequate. Set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and to size the (1+L)-period forecast accordingly, which will raise the base-stock to protect service without excessive extra holding given current strong pipeline.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand remains elevated vs historical samples (recent 5-demand mean \u2248119.2 vs historical 50.2). To reflect confirmed lead time and the sustained higher demand, set L by calculating observed lead times, and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures current regime while keeping sample size \u22653). This increases target base-stock to meet service while sigma recent_N captures current volatility; minimizes stockouts given large in-transit but elevated demand.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=184, in-transit=399. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple Period X conclude messages), and recent demand has shifted to a higher regime versus the older samples (sustained elevated weekly demand). I set L='calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time (which equals 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=10) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing short noise; this biases base-stock upward to protect service levels given confirmed lead time and substantial in-transit but elevated demand. This balances profit ($4) vs holding ($1) by focusing the estimate on recent elevated demand rather than the older low-demand samples.

Recent demand has softened vs the earlier spike; last 5 demand samples (Periods16-20) average ~79.8. To reflect confirmed lead time I request L='calculate' (backend will average observed lead times). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent regime (puts (1+L)\xd7mean_recent into the base-stock). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility.

LLM Rationale:

I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time from conclude history (stable at 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent regime (Periods 18-22 demands = 95,67,34,61,64; mean ~64.2) so the base-stock reflects current demand rather than the older high-demand burst.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time ~4 and a sustained higher-demand regime vs. the historical sample mean. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed behavior. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) to capture the higher recent mean demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead period. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility rather than long-ago low-variance samples. These choices bias the base-stock upward to preserve service level during the higher demand regime while keeping volatility estimation tied to recent data to avoid overstock from older low-variance periods.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrived=... lead_time=4 entries). Current on-hand=405, in-transit=67 \u2014 inventory is high relative to recent weekly demand (last 5 weeks demand avg \u224845.6), so I will use the calculated lead time to reflect observed behavior but keep demand/volatility estimates at their defaults to avoid driving additional purchases into an already large stock. L set to calculate to lock in observed 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L), preventing aggressive replenishment given current high on-hand/pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=373, in-transit=120, profit=$4, holding=$1 (q=0.8). Historical seed samples are limited and prior carry-over already confirmed actual lead time=4. Recent demand shows some variability but no new sustained changepoint since the last insight. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and broad historical demand, use default lead time and default demand/statistics so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the pipeline (on-hand + in-transit) already provides high cover.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent weekly demand has returned to ~40s (last 5 demands: 64,41,28,32,42 \u2192 mean \u224841.4). On-hand 398 + in-transit 76 = 474 units, which comfortably covers (1+L=5)\xd7recent mean (~207). Earlier lead-time was confirmed as 4 and promised L=4; no new lead-time evidence. To reflect current lower demand regime, I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the OR engine sizes base stock to recent demand; keep L at default (promised=4). This reduces unnecessary holding cost while maintaining service given ample pipeline inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=310, in-transit=76. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time consistently 4 periods; recent demand regime elevated (recent mean \u224893.2 vs historical sample mean 50.2, sustained across multiple periods). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (will average concluded lead times \u22484). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of last 5 samples) so the base-stock raises target to meet higher demand while capping orders via the backend cap to limit overstock given holding cost. This balances service (profit>holding) against excess inventory given substantial on-hand stock and in-transit units.

No clear, sustained new demand or lead-time shift (recent weeks revert near historical levels). To keep the OR backend stable and avoid overreacting to short fluctuations, I use the promised lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples so the base-stock calculation reflects long-run averages and the capped order cap is applied.

Period 30 (2019-09-02). Current inventory: on-hand=246, in-transit=177. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (evidence in concl. history); recent demand has moderated from earlier spike. Last 5 observed weekly demands = [32,42,88,69,48], mean=55.8. To respect confirmed promised lead time and capture recent demand regime, set L=default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, avoiding over-ordering on old high-demand weeks while accounting for recent variability. This balances service level (using recent demand) against holding cost given large on-hand position.

Current on-hand=195, in-transit=154 (pipeline=349) after sustained arrivals showing actual lead time = promised 4 periods (multiple conclude messages P5..P30 show 4-period arrivals). Recent demand has been moderate (many weeks 30\u201390) and inventory is ample vs near-term demand. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute base_stock and cap; this avoids overreacting to short-term swings given ample pipeline and prevents unnecessary holding cost while preserving high service (profit/holding => high q). No evidence of a new sustained regime or additional lost shipments.

Pipeline (112+302=414) currently covers multiple weeks of recent demand. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (4). Demand has shifted vs original samples; I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest 5-week mean and reflect current regime, and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. These choices steer the OR base-stock toward recent demand levels (improving service) while keeping holding risk controlled by using only the short recent window.

Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P28-P32 demands 69,48,74,83,50) average ~64.8, noticeably above original sample mean (50.2) but well below earlier spike; use a short recent window to capture current regime. Choose L=default to respect promised lead time (confirmed historically but no new evidence to change). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the latest demand level/volatility and avoid overreacting to older samples or past spikes.

Historical baseline samples (Jan-Feb) show low mean but recent history and prior carry-over indicate a sustained higher-demand regime and confirmed lead time=4. Use promised lead time to align with supplier terms. For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent five weeks' demand pattern and scale over the review+lead period; similarly use recent_N (N=5) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward current demand regime while keeping lead-time assumption at promised 4 to avoid overreacting to isolated delays.

Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 30-34) = [74,83,50,88,44], recent mean \u224867.8, higher than the very early sample mean. To be responsive to the recent regime while respecting confirmed LT=4, I set L to promised (default=4). I forecast mu_hat using the last 5 weeks (recent_N N=5) to capture current demand level across the (1+L) review+lead window. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility and let the OR engine compute safety stock; this balances service (avoid stockouts given elevated recent demand) vs holding cost (avoid overstock given sizable on-hand + in-transit).

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Observed on-hand=172, in-transit=145. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; recent demand (Periods 31-35 = 83,50,88,44,60) averages ~65 units/week. To reflect recent demand regime and confirmed lead time, set L by calculate (uses observed lead times). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the OR forecast on the last 5 weeks' demand. This raises target base stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent demand while sigma from recent_N captures recent variability, balancing service level against holding cost given Profit=$4 and Holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=133, in-transit=190. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4 and an earlier demand regime shift; recent realized weekly demand (Periods 32-36) averages ~56 units, near longer-run levels. I keep L as default (promised=4) because concluded history supports it. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent demand regime and reduce influence of early high-demand periods; this balances service vs holding given current healthy pipeline (323 total) and moderate recent demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019/10/28 (P38). On-hand=86, in-transit=190; historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed Period6). Recent demand regime has been higher than the original sample; use recent data to reflect elevated demand. L set explicit=4 to lock actual observed lead time. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (recent mean ~93.2 used by backend). This raises base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the new regime while sigma from recent N controls safety stock, balancing $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. Inventory on-hand 129 + in-transit 130; profit $4, holding $1. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (strong evidence across many concludes). Recent demand has been around ~50 units/week (Periods 34-38 demands: 44,60,39,47,57 -> mean ~49.4). To align the OR base-stock with current demand regime and confirmed lead time, set L by averaging observed lead times, and use a recent_N (N=5) forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level/volatility over the review+lead horizon (1+L periods). This keeps service high while limiting excess holding given substantial on-hand + in-transit inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent concluded lead-times have consistently been 4 periods. On-hand=124, in-transit=90 gives substantial pipeline cover. Recent weekly demand (Periods 35-39 = 60,39,47,57,50) averages ~50, close to historical sample mean 50.2; earlier high-demand regime was previously recorded but recent five weeks show reversion. To let the OR engine use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats, I select default for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (profit/holding => high target) with current ample on-hand+pipeline and avoids over-reacting to older regime shifts or transient noise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $86.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand (Periods 36-40) averages ~48\u201351 units/week; historical sample mean ~50.2. Historical/concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. On-hand 118 + in-transit 187 = 305 units; (1+L)=5 periods demand at historical mean \u2248 5\xd750.2=251, so current pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers the review+lead demand. I therefore use the promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from the long-run sample mean/variance; this avoids overreacting to short recent fluctuations and limits extra holding cost given already ample pipeline stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=80, in-transit=328. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple 'arrived' messages: orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Pipeline plus on-hand is ample vs recent weekly demand (~40\u201360/week), but shipments have occasionally been delayed/lost historically so I rely on observed lead-time evidence. Set L using 'calculate' to lock in observed average lead time (4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) \u2014 this leverages full historical sample to produce a stable base-stock while the high profit:holding ratio (4:1) yields a relatively high service target. This avoids overreacting to short recent dips and balances service level vs holding costs given ample pipeline.

Recent 5-period demand (Periods 38-42) shows elevated and variable demand including a large observed spike in Period 42 (may reflect holiday/stockout). To be responsive to recent demand regime and variability while preserving confirmed lead-time evidence, set L based on observed lead times, and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets higher service given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=4, holding=1 implies high service level).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09 (Period 44). On-hand=0, in-transit=396. Historical concluded lead times remain consistently 4 periods (no new evidence to change). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P39-43 demands = 50,51,38,133,43) shows elevated/variable weekly demand (mean ~63) with a large spike at P42 (holiday/TPS-like). To balance service (profit $4 vs holding $1) I keep promised lead time and bias forecasts to recent demand: set L=default to respect supplier promise and past observed consistency; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent higher mean and volatility so OR backend raises the base-stock while accounting for increased variability. No overdue arrivals appear lost (in-transit=396 consistent with recent arrivals), so no explicit L extension.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Historical samples show a sustained higher-demand regime detected earlier (recent mean \u224893.2 vs historical \u224850.2, confirmed over 5 periods). On-hand=111, in-transit=254 (total pipeline=365) \u2014 sufficient coverage vs (1+L) demand given L\u22484 but we keep safety via recent demand estimates. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead-time evidence (observed lead_time=4 periods repeatedly). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to 'recent_N' with N=5 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 5 periods to capture current mean/volatility), which steers the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost.

Set L via observed average lead times to lock in confirmed L=4. For demand, use recent_N=5 to capture the recent higher regime and the large recent spike; apply same recent window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices steer the OR base-stock toward higher coverage (service) while sigma from recent volatility tempers extreme order quantities to limit holding cost.
