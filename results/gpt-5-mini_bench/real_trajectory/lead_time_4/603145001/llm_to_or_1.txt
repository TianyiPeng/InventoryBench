Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Only 5 weekly historical samples available (mean=54.2) with no sustained changepoint or arrival history to infer lead-time shifts. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend builds (1+L)-period coverage from the full sample set.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=108 (ordered in P1) but P1 conclude shows arrived=0 for that order \u2014 this is expected given promised lead time; no concluded arrivals yet to infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean ~54.2. I use default lead time (promised L=4) because there is insufficient concluded evidence of a different lead time or lost shipment. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost based on provided profit/holding ratio and avoiding overreacting to one recent high demand (91 reported demand in Period 1 was not sold due to zero on-hand and cannot be fully validated as a persistent regime shift).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. No concluded arrivals yet (Period1/2 orders showed arrived=0), so actual lead time is unconfirmed; cannot infer lost shipments from available concludes. Historical weekly demand samples (59,14,28,85,85) give mean=54.2 and std\u224832.5. Promised lead time is 4; in-transit=223 vs. (1+L)*mean\u2248271 suggests pipeline is slightly short of covering (L+1) periods but arrivals are not yet observed. I choose default methods: use promised L (avoid premature lead-time adjustment), and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) while avoiding overreaction to two zero-arrival concludes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=349; three consecutive weeks of high demand observed (Periods 1-3: 91, 110, 111) versus earlier historical weekly mean (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04 mean=54.2). No concluded arrivals yet (orders placed earlier show arrived=0) so cannot infer actual lead time \u2014 treat promised lead time as valid for OR. I detect a sustained upward demand regime over the last 3 periods; to respond I set L=default (use promised 4), use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat to capture the higher recent mean demand across review+lead, and recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to regain service level while recognizing potential delayed shipments (pipeline=349) so not overstating long-term demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04)=54.2 weekly vs recent Periods 1-3 (2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25) mean=104 (+92%); sustained for 3 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand has stepped up: last 3 observed demands (Periods1-3) = 91,110,111 => mean=104; Period4 fell to 63 but the 3-period uptick was previously flagged as sustained. On-hand=0, in-transit=472. Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals have appeared, so I cannot confirm a lead-time change; I keep L at the promised setting. To capture the recent higher demand regime I use a recent_N forecast for demand (N=3 -> mean=104) so backend will target (1+L)*mean = 5*104 = 520 units across review+lead; current pipeline (472) is short of that, so the OR engine will generate an order. I also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma to reflect volatility in the same recent window. This balances higher service level for the confirmed short-lived spike while avoiding overcommitment given uncertain arrivals and no lead-time confirmation.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). We have on-hand 16 and large pipeline 417 (total 433). One concluded arrival shows actual lead time=4 (Period1 order arrived in Period5). Use calculate for L to let backend confirm observed average lead time from concluded history. Recent demand shows a regime change earlier (higher mean around 104 for Periods 1-3) but latest three observed demands (Periods 3-5 = 111,63,92) are more mixed; to be responsive I choose recent_N for demand estimates using the last 3 samples so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the most recent demand volatility and mean over the review+lead window. This keeps orders conservative given a large pipeline and avoids overstock while maintaining service against recent higher peaks.

Daily Reward (R_t): $414.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand remains in a higher regime (multiple weeks near ~100 units). On-hand=22, in-transit=358 (large pipeline) so avoid overstating demand forecast but maintain higher service target. Set L by calculation from observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime while smoothing older low samples; this balances service (profit>holding) against holding cost given substantial pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6)

Daily Reward (R_t): $462.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent demand has stabilized at a higher regime (Periods 5-7 demands = 92, 109, 122). On-hand=26, in-transit=363 (sufficient pipeline for several weeks). Lead time evidence (concludes) consistently shows 4 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 3 weeks: 92,109,122) when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) to reflect volatility of the same recent window. These choices bias the base-stock toward the recent higher mean while using matching recent volatility; with pipeline already large this avoids underordering if demand persists but keeps holding risk controlled via accurate recent-based sigma.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=373. Historical baseline mean=54.2 (early Jan-Feb) but recent demand has shifted materially higher: recent demands (Periods 5-8)=92,109,122,149 (mean=118) \u2014 sustained for 4 periods. Lead time has been observed repeatedly as 4 periods (carry-over). To reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent regime samples (recent_N) with N=4 so the OR engine targets stock for the elevated demand; L left as default (promised lead time=4) since concluded arrivals confirm it. This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher demand) against holding cost by using recent demand statistics rather than the long-run low mean.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=478. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6); use observed lead time. Recent demand has been higher and sustained since the regime shift identified earlier; use recent data to estimate demand and volatility. Set L to calculate (backend will use observed average lead time = 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated recent mean and variability (last 5 demand observations) so the OR engine raises target base-stock and caps appropriately while limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). Recent demand has shifted materially higher vs. early historical samples: last 10 observed weekly demands (P1\u2013P10) average is substantially above the pre-shift historical mean; lead time confirmed as 4 periods from concluded messages. On-hand=0, in-transit=551 (pipeline present). I set L to default (use promised/confirmed 4). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat so the (1+L)\xd7mean reflects the last 10 weeks. I also use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat so variability is estimated from the same recent window. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher recent demand while keeping volatility consistent for the OR engine's cap calculation.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand regime is the higher regime confirmed earlier (sustained ~3 periods with mean \u2248104/week). On-hand =15, in-transit=420 \u2014 ample pipeline but arrivals have 1-period observation delay; past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4. I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed higher recent regime (use last 3 periods of demand to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). For volatility I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability. These choices bias the OR engine toward the higher recent mean while letting the backend compute base_stock and the capped order respecting the long confirmed lead time and current large pipeline, balancing service level against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=29, in-transit=347 (pipeline large). Historical data and prior carry-over indicate a sustained demand regime increase vs older samples; lead time has been observed as 4. Use promised lead time (default). For mu_hat use a recent_N estimate to capture the higher recent demand regime (N=8 captures recent ~2 months of weekly demands). Keep sigma_hat as default (uses all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overfitting volatility from short bursts. These parameters bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to meet elevated demand while the large pipeline limits aggressive ordering and controls holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand regime confirmed earlier: sustained higher demand since Period 5; latest 3 concluded demands = [116,119,119] (mean \u2248118). On-hand=68, in-transit=354 (large pipeline covering multiple weeks). Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; promised=4 so use default. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the current elevated mean demand over the review+lead horizon. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned with the confirmed higher demand while the large in-transit reduces urgency and limits extra holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent history shows a sustained higher demand regime starting Period 5 (mean jumped ~+92% vs earlier) and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=26 and in-transit=346 (large pipeline) \u2014 pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers multiple upcoming periods but we still target the recent demand regime for forecast. Set L via observed-average (consistent 4). Use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained post-shift regime (Period 5\u201314 = 10 demand observations) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the recent high-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given current ample pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/05/27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=511. Historic data and conclude messages show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (mean up ~92%) and repeated observed arrivals consistent with a 4-period lead time. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed as 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 5\u201315) to capture the new higher-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=11 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices align forecasts to the sustained higher demand while the backend's capped policy will limit orders relative to pipeline (511 in-transit) to avoid overstocking given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=580. Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4; recent demand has shifted upward and remained high: last 4 realized weekly demands (Periods 13-16) = [119, 171, 137, 160], mean=146.75. I set L to default (promised 4) because observed lead time matches the promise. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=4 ((1+L)-period forecast uses the recent mean to size base stock and recent volatility to set safety). This focuses the OR backend on the higher recent demand while respecting the 4-period lead time and limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=36, in-transit=601. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 periods (consistent P1->P5...P13->P17). Recent demand (Periods 15-17: 137,160,129) remains elevated vs older history; to target service while avoiding excess holding I use the promised/default lead time and base demand forecast on the most recent 3 periods (captures the sustained higher regime). Volatility likewise from the last 3 periods to reflect current variability.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history confirms lead time=4 and a sustained demand regime shift to higher weekly demand (noted in carry-over). Current on-hand=40 + in-transit=584 provides ample pipeline. I set L to promised (4) since concluded arrivals consistently show 4. I choose recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent behavior (captures elevated demand observed since Period 5 and through Period 18) so the OR backend builds a base-stock sized for the new regime while limiting excess hold cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. Recent demand elevated: last 5 period demands (P15-P19)=137,160,129,117,101 (avg\u2248128.8). On-hand 104 + in-transit 464 = 568 units. With promised L\u22484, review+lead horizon =5 periods; projected need \u22485\xd7128.8\u2248644 units \u2192 pipeline short (~76 units). Lead-time evidence in history consistently shows 4-period arrivals. I choose L calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher recent demand regime. For volatility I also use recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These settings raise the base-stock to match the recent higher demand while sigma reflects recent uncertainty so the OR backend will increase orders to recover coverage without overcommitting to older low-demand samples.

Recent demand regime (noted in carry-over) shows higher mean vs historical baseline; pipeline (453) + on-hand (173) is large relative to weekly demand so avoid aggressive upward forecast. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent regime while using sufficient samples to smooth noise. This balances service level (maintain availability given confirmed L=4) against holding cost given current high inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Recent demand regime higher vs historical (carry-over noted: ~+92% since Period 5) and sustained. Current inventory: on-hand=302, in-transit=267 (pipeline total=569). With promised lead time 4, need (1+L)=5 periods coverage; pipeline+on-hand already large relative to typical recent 5-period demand, so avoid inflating target. I set L to default (promised 4). For demand estimate and volatility I use recent_N to focus on the post-changepoint regime (stable high-demand window). I choose N=12 to capture the last ~12 concluded periods since the regime shift while smoothing short noise. These parameters bias the OR engine toward the recent higher mean/variance but avoid over-ordering given current ample pipeline, balancing service level (profit$4 vs holding$1) by relying on recent-demand statistics rather than long-run lower mean.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=329, in-transit=227 (pipeline=556) \u2014 ample coverage vs typical weekly demand. Actual lead time has been confirmed at 4 in past concludes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-159.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; I use promised/default L=4. Current on-hand 331 + in-transit 182 = 513 units (ample buffer vs recent demand). Demand has moderated vs the early spike; recent weeks (Periods 16\u201323) show a lower, more stable regime than the early Feb surge. To make the forecast responsive to the recent regime while still smoothing noise, I use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures roughly the last two months of weekly demand). This keeps replenishment tuned to current demand and limits excess holding cost given the high holding cost sensitivity relative to profit.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=367, in-transit=93 (total pipeline=460). Historical demand shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 5 (carry-over recorded earlier); lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, I use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and base forecasts on the most recent high-demand regime. I therefore ask the backend to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the last N=20 demand samples (captures the sustained post-changepoint regime and caps N at 20). This balances higher target base-stock for elevated demand with volatility estimated from the same recent window.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05. Recent on-hand=292 + in-transit=228 = 520 total pipeline. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 19\u201325): [101,60,57,77,43,82,75], recent mean \u224870.7/wk. With promised L=4 (review+lead =5 periods) (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248353.5 units; current pipeline (520) comfortably covers forecasted need, so no aggressive uplifts. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; demand has settled into a lower recent regime vs early-year spikes. I therefore use default lead time (promised=4) and a recent_N demand estimate to capture the current regime. I select N=7 (covers the 7 most recent weeks showing the stable lower regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This balances service (using recent demand) against holding costs given sizable pipeline, avoiding over-ordering while preserving fill rate.

Use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, keeping orders conservative given high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been lower (late Jun\u2013Aug ~30\u201380/week) and earlier analysis confirmed lead time = 4. Current on-hand=299 and in-transit=206 (large pipeline) which already covers multiple (1+L) periods of demand, so avoid increasing forecast aggressiveness. Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates (use full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend uses long-run stats and the capped order cap to prevent excess ordering given high inventory. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while limiting holding cost exposure.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Recent observed demand has fallen to ~20\u201330 units/week (Periods 26-28: 28,29,19) while on-hand (309) + in-transit (198)=507 units is ample versus short-run demand. Lead times have consistently been 4 periods in concluded history. To avoid over-ordering given high inventory and recent low demand, set L via recent observations (calculate) and forecast mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent short regime (last 3 periods) so the backend sizes orders to current weak demand and low volatility.

Recent demand has trended lower than the early-year spike and current inventory is very high, so avoid raising the forecast. Use default lead time and default demand estimates (backend uses full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L)) to let the OR engine cap orders and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service.

On-hand=407, in-transit=87 provides large cover vs near-term demand; no new evidence of lead-time change (historic arrivals consistently show 4). I set L to default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=5 to capture the clear, sustained low-demand regime in the last 5 periods so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and volatility estimates accordingly, lowering overstock risk while preserving service given substantial on-hand + pipeline.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Current on-hand=342, in-transit=92 (total pipeline=434) which covers ~16.6 weeks at recent demand \u2014 ample buffer. Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods; no new LT evidence. Recent demand has dropped from earlier highs; I will base demand forecasts on the most recent regime to avoid overstocking. Chosen methods: L=default to use promised/confirmed 4; mu_hat=recent_N with N=7 to capture the current low-demand regime (last 7 demand periods); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep target base-stock aligned to current demand and limit excess holding cost given large existing inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Current on-hand=310, in-transit=80. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 observations), so use observed lead time. Recent demand (periods 30-37) is moderate (roughly 16\u201352/week) with no new sustained regime shift. Therefore: set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 4); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps policy aligned with long-run demand stats and the confirmed 4-period lead time, balancing service level (via base-stock) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04. On-hand=333, in-transit=102. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Recent demand has fallen versus the early-2019 spike: last 10 concluded weekly demands (P29-P38) mean \u224827.9, (1+L)=5 \u2192 implied 5-week demand \u2248140. I choose recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the forecast to the most recent stable regime (captures the sustained lower-demand run), and calculate for L to confirm observed lead time. This keeps base-stock tight to recent demand, reducing holding cost while preserving service given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=322, in-transit=102. Historical lead time confirmed = 4 periods; using promised/default L preserves that. Recent demand has declined versus mid-year spikes; I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime (periods 37-39) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to current lower demand and avoids excessive holding costs while maintaining service. N=3 chosen because the last 3 periods show a consistent lower-demand regime.

Past periods confirm actual lead time = 4, so use promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples) to let the OR engine set base-stock consistent with profit/holding tradeoff.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. Recent weekly demand has been low (Periods 36-41 demands = 36,44,25,11,13,11) versus earlier high-season levels. On-hand=330, in-transit=101 (total pipeline 431) \u2014 coverage is ample vs current low demand. Lead time historically confirmed at 4. Use L=default to keep promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current lower-demand regime (last 6 weeks), avoiding overstock from historical high-demand samples. This keeps base stock aligned to current demand and reduces holding cost risk given high on-hand inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. Recent weekly demand has been low (~11\u201321) for many weeks; on-hand=379, in-transit=31 (pipeline=410) \u2014 ample cover vs. a 4-period promised lead time. Historical data shows earlier regime shifts but no new sustained change in the last months. I keep L at the promised/default (4) to reflect confirmed lead-time behavior and avoid overreacting to short noise. I request mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 to focus the forecast on the latest demand regime (reducing influence of early high-demand weeks) so the OR backend will size base stock for the 5-period review+lead demand with tighter recent mean/variance, balancing service level against $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been low (last 5 weeks: 11,13,11,21,9; mean ~13) and on-hand inventory is high (370) with 31 in-transit. Historical lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service on current low demand, I use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the recent 5-week window (recent_N N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets a much smaller replenishment level aligned with current low demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent weekly demand has fallen to low teens (last several periods: 21,9,7,11,13,11,21,7,9,7...), and historical lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods. On-hand=363 and in-transit=31 provide ample cover versus recent demand; to avoid excess inventory I use a recent-demand estimate. Set L to promised (confirmed) 4, mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 8 demand observations to capture current low-demand regime and reduced volatility. This tightens forecast versus long-run mean and reduces unnecessary holding cost while preserving high service level (profit/holding implies high target quantile).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). On-hand=318, in-transit=0; no arrivals pending and no overdue shipments visible. Recent weekly demand has been low but variable (last 5 demands: 11,21,9,7,76) so I use a short recent window to capture current regime while smoothing the spike. Promised lead time remains 4 and historical concludes confirm L=4; use default (promised) to keep OR aligned. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the latest demand level/volatility over the review+lead horizon so the backend builds a base-stock tuned to current demand and high service target (profit/holding implies q=0.8).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=221, in-transit=0. Historical lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods (see earlier concludes). Recent week-on-week demand shows some holiday volatility (Periods 45-46: 76,97) but not a sustained new regime. To be conservative and rely on long-run statistics, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance with L=4. This avoids overreacting to short holiday spikes while keeping service high given healthy on-hand inventory.
