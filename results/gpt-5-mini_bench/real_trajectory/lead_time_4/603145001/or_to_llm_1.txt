Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (arrivals consistently match orders after 4 periods). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=0, in-transit=16 (no additional concluded arrivals visible). Demand analysis: recent weeks show a sharp uptick (Periods 45-46 demand 76 and 97) raising short-term average versus the low regime earlier in the year; this looks like a temporary spike but is recent and significant enough to justify stocking. OR baseline: recommends 143 using promised L=4 and long-run historical stats. Adjustment decision: I accept OR's capped base-stock recommendation of 143 units because (a) with L=4 we must cover current + next 4 periods (L+1=5) and recent 2-week high demand implies materially higher short-run demand, (b) current pipeline (16) is insufficient to prevent near-term stockouts, and (c) holding cost is modest ($1) vs profit ($4) so risk of understock is costlier. Therefore place order = 143 units. ",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Followed OR's recommendation (143 units). Actual lead time confirmed at 4 and recent demand spiked (76,97), on-hand=0 and in-transit=16 so OR's capped order is appropriate to avoid stockouts.",
