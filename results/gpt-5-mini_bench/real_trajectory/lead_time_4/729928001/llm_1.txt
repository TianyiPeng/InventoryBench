Demand regime: recent history shows stable weekly demand around 80 with no evidence of abrupt shift. Lead time & pipeline: supplier promised lead time = 4 periods; currently on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet, so assume promised lead time until contradicted. Inventory policy: must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because current-period demand occurs after ordering and arrivals occur after L periods. Forecast & order qty: use expected weekly demand \u224880 \xd7 5 = 400 to cover current + pipeline exposure while minimizing stockouts; no extra safety stock added given low variance in history. Holding cost considered but is small relative to profit (H=$1 vs Profit=$19), so stocking to cover five periods is justified.",

Lead time: previously confirmed as 4 periods. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand=62, in-transit=470 => total pipeline coverage=532 units. Decision rule: cover L+1=5 weeks of demand. Forecast: conservative weekly demand \u2248100 (moderate, excluding P42 promo outlier) -> 5-week need \u2248500 units. Pipeline (532) exceeds 5-week need, so no replenishment now to avoid extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) while preserving service. Order placed will arrive in 4 periods, beyond the immediate holiday window and likely unnecessary. Action: order 0 to minimize holding cost while maintaining service.",

{
  "rationale": "Date=2019-12-30 (week between Christmas and New Year). Product: casual skirt \u2014 no major positive seasonal driver at year-end; demand recently fell from late-Nov peak. Historical recent weekly demand: P42=243 (promotion/peak), P43=112, P44=118, P45=70, P46=42. On-hand=120 will satisfy current week demand partially; in-transit=370 (multiple orders) will arrive after confirmed lead_time=4 periods (arrivals visible in conclude after P51). Lead time confirmed = 4 (per prior concludes). Given large pipeline (370) and moderate/declining demand in recent periods, placing additional order risks excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) with limited upside. To maximize Profit*units_sold \u2212 HoldingCost*ending_inventory, do not order this period and use on-hand to meet near-term demand while awaiting in-transit shipments.",
