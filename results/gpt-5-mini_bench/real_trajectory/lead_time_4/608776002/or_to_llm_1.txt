{
  "rationale": "Lead-time & pipeline: Concluded history (Periods 5,6,8\u201314,16) confirms actual lead time = 4. In-transit=540 equals outstanding orders: P32=95 (arrives during P36), P34=445 (arrives during P38). These in-transit arrivals will be available to meet demand in Periods 36\u201338 even though we don't observe them until later. Current on-hand=0, so immediate available inventory during Period36 demand will include the P32 arrival (95) which occurs after decision but before demand resolution. Demand outlook: Recent periods show a strong surge: P30\u201332 = 92,116,116 (avg 108), then P33\u201335 = 319,272,315 (avg \u2248302). This is a substantial, recent upward shift versus prior post-shift averages. Timing implication: Any order placed now will arrive in Period 40 (decision in P36 \u2192 arrival in P40), so it cannot help meet the current surge through Period 38. Required coverage: With L=4, target coverage horizon is L+1=5 periods. If elevated demand persists near recent avg \u2248300, 5-period demand \u22481500. Current pipeline (540) + upcoming arrivals (95 during P36 and 445 during P38 are already counted in the 540) leave a large shortfall if the surge sustains. Risk tradeoff: Holding cost = profit = $1 \u2192 critical fractile is 0.5; over-ordering is costly. OR's recommendation (43) is based on long-run low historical mean and promised lead time; it ignores the recent surge and the current pipeline composition. Decision: order a moderate replenishment now to replenish pipeline for the medium term while avoiding huge overstock if the spike is short-lived. I place an order of 360 units: this augments the in-transit pipeline (540) so that when the P34 arrival (445) comes and combined with this order (arriving P40), we reduce risk of stockouts if elevated demand continues but avoid excessively large holding costs if demand reverts downward. I prefer a conservative mid-sized order rather than OR's tiny 43 (which would risk stockout if high demand persists) or a very large order (which would create heavy holding cost if spike is transient).",
