Date is 2019-02-11 (late winter heading into spring) \u2014 demand for light T-shirts often ramps toward spring.

Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet, so treat actual lead time as unknown and assume L=4 for planning. Inventory assessment: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, so current pipeline provides no coverage. Decision logic: follow the guideline to cover (L+1)=5 periods of expected demand given the new higher-demand regime. Use recent higher-demand average (~87 units/week) as the per-period forecast, round to 90 for prudence. Order = forecast_per_period * (L+1) - on-hand - in-transit = 90*5 = 450 units. This balances service after the 4-period lead time while recognizing holding cost equals profit (so avoid excessive overstock).",
