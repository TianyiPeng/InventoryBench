Product is a basic women's T-shirt \u2014 normally could see seasonal uplift, but recent on-site demand has collapsed and shows no holiday spike. Demand regime: recent concluded demands (P42\u2013P45) = 4,0,3,1 (avg \u22482 units/period). Longer-run since P33 demand has been near single digits, confirming a very low-demand regime. Lead time / pipeline: historic concludes show lead time = 4 periods (observed repeatedly P1\u2192P5 etc.). Current inventory: on-hand = 311, in-transit = 0. With expected demand \u22482/wk and holding cost = $1/unit/period, carrying large inventory is costly; placing an order risks increasing holding losses and is unnecessary given pipeline empty. Action: place no order this period to avoid additional holding cost and because existing stock greatly exceeds near-term demand.",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas), a low-demand seasonal window for everyday womens T-shirts. Demand regime: recent periods show very low sales (P43\u2013P46 = 0,3,1,1), consistent with the sustained downward regime established earlier (no new upward signal). Lead time & pipeline: actual lead time previously confirmed = 4 periods; currently in-transit=0 so no incoming arrivals expected. Inventory: on-hand=310 units, which far exceeds expected demand over the upcoming lead-time + current period (forecast ~1\u20135 units/week). Holding cost ($1/unit/period) makes excess inventory costly. Action logic: do not order now \u2014 avoid additional holding costs while demand is low and no evidence of imminent regime shift or calendar spike.",
