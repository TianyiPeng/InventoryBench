Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples (46,33,53,37,21) average 38 units/week. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so pipeline empty; no concluded arrivals or lead-time evidence yet. Promised lead time remains appropriate (no observed arrivals to suggest otherwise). Using default methods lets the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean demand and scaled std across all samples, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) via its built-in q. This keeps parameters data-driven and responsive once arrivals/concludes provide lead-time evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=59 (order placed P1). No concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time cannot be inferred; promised lead time (4) remains best default. Historical weekly demand mean\u224838 (samples: 46,33,53,37,21). Use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to historical demand while allowing the OR engine's cap to limit order size given the existing in-transit pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent concluded history shows orders placed in P1 (59) and P2 (56) have not yet arrived (arrived=0), but this is only 2 periods without arrival so cannot confirm a lead-time change or lost shipments. On-hand=0, in-transit=115 (sum of outstanding orders). I select L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time because concluded arrivals do not yet demonstrate a sustained lead-time shift. For demand I choose mu_hat=default so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) based on historical weekly samples (mean=38), giving a (1+4)*38 forecast that covers review+lead demand. For sigma_hat I choose default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). These conservative defaults avoid overreacting to two missing arrivals and let the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost using the provided historical demand statistics.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=0, in-transit=169 (sum of orders 59+56+54). No concluded arrivals yet; this is expected because promised lead time=4 (orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 would arrive in future periods). Historical weekly demand samples mean=38, std based on all samples. I use default lead time (promised=4) because there is no concluded evidence of a different actual lead time or lost shipments. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while accounting for pipeline inventory.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent weekly demand mean = 38 (samples: 46,33,53,37,21). On-hand=0, in-transit=184 but no arrivals have concluded for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (4 consecutive periods with arrived=0). This suggests actual lead time may exceed the promised 4 periods or some shipments are lost; to be conservative I set L explicitly longer than promised to force larger pipeline coverage. I use mu_hat and sigma_hat defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, preserving historical demand signal while the larger L buffers against missing arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-4 have not concluded (4 consecutive periods of arrived=0) \u2014 evidence of prolonged lead time or lost shipments; monitor for confirmed arrival patterns before reverting L.

Daily Profit: $48.00, Daily Holding Cost: $47.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $1.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent conclude shows order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 => actual lead time observed=4 periods. On-hand=47, in-transit=176; pipeline + on-hand covers multiple periods. Given confirmed lead time=4, use lead-time inference via 'calculate' to reflect observed data. Demand history (weekly samples provided) will be scaled by (1+L)=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat; use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (q from profit/ (profit+holding) is moderate) while avoiding manual over-adjustment given limited data and confirmed L.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period 1 order arrived in Period 5; lead_time=4).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-53.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1->P5, Period2->P6). On-hand=93 + in-transit=120 provides ample coverage vs historical mean demand. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (all-sample) methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided historical weekly samples (46,33,53,37,21). This preserves a stable forecast while the confirmed lead-time evidence is incorporated; it avoids overreacting to short-run noise and ensures pipeline targets (L+1 periods) are met given recent arrivals and potential past lost shipments.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Current inventory: on-hand=100, in-transit=66. No overdue/unexplained missing shipments remain. Set L via observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all historical samples) so the OR backend uses the full-sample demand estimate (mean=38/week, (1+L)=5 => mu_hat=190) and full-sample volatility; this balances a high service level (profit/total cost ratio implies q\u22480.8) against holding cost given substantial on-hand plus pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). Current inventory: on-hand=73, in-transit=52 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=125 units, which covers several weeks of recent demand (recent demands: 12,10,47,42). No sustained demand regime change detected (insufficient consistent shift over 3+ periods). I will use the promised/default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend applies its base-stock calculations consistently given confirmed LT and historical samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Demand context: recent weekly demands have been moderate (historical samples available) and lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods by concluded arrivals. Current on-hand=96, in-transit=48 (pipeline total=144). No sustained demand regime change detected; shipments that previously appeared delayed have subsequently arrived consistent with L=4. Use default calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std: this aligns with confirmed lead time and avoids overfitting to recent variability while balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders observed with W=4). Current inventory: on-hand=75, in-transit=75. Recent demand (last concluded periods) remains in line with historical samples; no sustained demand regime shift detected. I select L="calculate" to use the average of observed lead times (reflecting confirmed 4-period actual lead time). I select mu_hat="default" and sigma_hat="default" so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, giving a conservative replenishment that balances high service target (profit/holding implies q\u22480.8) against holding cost and the confirmed lead time. This approach accounts for the observed arrivals/in-transit pipeline and avoids overreacting to single-period variability or delayed arrivals.

Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=60, in-transit=92 (pipeline total=152). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders observed with lead_time=4). Demand history shows moderate weekly volumes with occasional spikes; no sustained new demand regime detected. Given confirmed LT=4 and no clear sustained demand shift, use default statistics so OR backend uses promised lead time and full-sample demand moments. This keeps policy aligned with observed LT while avoiding overfitting to short spikes; it balances service level (use full-sample mean over (1+L) periods) vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-16.00

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has softened vs. the Jan samples: last 8 periods demand = [12,10,47,42,28,21,15,9], mean=23.0, sum covering (1+L) periods = 5*23=115 units. Current on-hand 52 + in-transit 102 = 154 > 115, so pipeline coverage is adequate. Lead-time evidence from concluded periods consistently shows 4-period arrivals; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime change since prior confirmation. I set L using observed lead times, and use a recent_N window (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the more recent lower mean and current volatility, which balances service level against holding cost given tight profit/holding ratio.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent weekly demand has been ~20\u201347 (recent sold values: 28,9,15,21,28,42,47,12,10,47,42,28,21,15,9,28 across history); on-hand=71 + in-transit=55 => pipeline=126 units, which comfortably covers several weeks of demand. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (observed repeatedly). I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend (which expects (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) can compute the base-stock and cap with full sample statistics. This keeps parameters simple and leverages the confirmed L=4 while avoiding overreacting to short-term variability or occasional delayed/lost shipments.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent concluded history consistently shows orders arriving 4 periods after placement (several explicit 'lead_time was 4' observations), so I set L via 'calculate' to let backend confirm average observed lead time=4. On-hand=29 + in-transit=60 = 89 units; no new sustained demand regime detected in samples (historical weekly mean=38). Use default demand/volatility methods so backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This favors a higher service level consistent with profit/holding ratio (profit $4 vs holding $1) while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid under-ordering after prior delayed arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders observed arriving 4 periods after ordering). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=100 (pipeline present from recent orders); recent demand has been volatile with large spikes (e.g., Periods 14-15 demands 69 and 136) but historical sample mean (2019 Jan weekly samples) is 38. Given confirmed LT=4 and limited sample set, use default lead time (promised) and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples; this balances service level (covering L+1 periods) versus holding cost while relying on confirmed LT evidence rather than short-term spike noise.

Demand historical sample mean=38 units/week (samples from Jan-Feb). No new sustained changepoint detected in demand or lead time. Use promised/default lead time and default demand moments to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap; this keeps policy aligned with observed 4-period lead time and historical demand while avoiding overfitting to recent volatile sales spikes.

Recent demand has shifted up sharply starting Period 14 (demands: 69,136,130,115) \u2014 sustained high demand over 4 periods. To capture the new regime I set L using observed lead times and set demand forecasts using recent data (last 4 periods) so the OR backend raises base stock to meet higher demand while respecting pipeline and cap constraints.

On-hand=0, in-transit=390 (covers multiple future periods). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and many recent periods show a sustained demand increase (multiple weeks of very high sales since Period 14). To reflect the new high-demand regime I keep L at the promised/default (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the most recent demand mean/volatility (N=6 covers the sustained high-demand window). This raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated variability, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Recent demand has shifted upwards since mid-May (sustained high weekly demand from Periods 14\u201321), and multiple concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. Current on-hand=76, in-transit=381 (pipeline=457) \u2014 ample coverage but demand regime is higher than the early-sample baseline, so use recent demand to set forecast. Set L using observed lead times. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the most recent 8 periods) so the OR engine targets service for the newer, higher-demand regime while the capped order cap will limit excess ordering given pipeline.

To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set L to the promised lead time and use recent_N for demand estimates using the most recent regime (~Periods 14\u201324, 11 periods) so the backend bases base-stock on current demand levels and not the low January samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts during elevated summer demand) against holding cost by using recent demand mean and volatility rather than the full-sample averages.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many confirmations), and recent demand has been variable with spikes in May\u2013July but no sustained new regime since last insight. Given robust pipeline and high on-hand, use promised lead time and the backend's default demand estimates to avoid overreacting to short-term spikes; this balances service level (keep stock) against holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Recent weekly demand has risen vs. early-sample baseline (last 5 demands: 21,12,17,36,70 \u2192 mean 31.2). On-hand=179 + in-transit=144 = 323 units covers ~5 periods of demand at that recent mean (5*31.2=156), so pipeline is ample. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the recent higher/volatile demand regime while keeping the base-stock responsive. This balances service (avoid stockouts given recent spikes) against holding cost by shrinking the forecast window to recent behavior.

No recent sustained changepoint in demand detected; use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats. Choosing L=default to keep lead-time at promised 4 (supported by concluded history). Choosing mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise and recent shipment timing.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=80, in-transit=102 (total pipeline=182) and promised lead time is 4. Demand shows a clear upward regime starting around Period 17 (sustained higher weekly demand thereafter). I therefore keep L as default (promised=4) since concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. For demand forecast I use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean: N=14 (Periods 17\u201330) to compute mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(recent 14 demands). I also set sigma_hat using recent_N N=14 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the base-stock to recent elevated demand while keeping L tied to confirmed lead-time behavior, helping the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost given current pipeline.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=235. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed previously). Demand showed a sustained upward regime beginning around Period 14 (mid-May): average weekly demand before P14 (Periods 1-13) ~28; since P14 (Periods 14-31) weekly average ~89 (18 periods). To capture the recent higher demand profile and reduce stockouts while respecting the confirmed L=4, I use recent-window estimates over the post-changepoint regime (18 periods) for both demand mean and volatility. These params bias orders toward higher coverage of the elevated demand while the backend's capped policy limits extreme ordering against holding costs.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand has been substantially higher than the early-sample mean (many weeks of 80\u2013130 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=380 which provides cover vs. multi-period demand but some earlier orders experienced delayed arrivals \u2014 historical concluded lead times are consistently 4. Set L to promised/default (4). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime (gives the OR engine a multi-period demand estimate and higher volatility), while relying on in-transit stock to cover near-term service until those parameters take effect.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-30. On-hand=0, in-transit=416. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods repeatedly. Recent demand (Periods 30-33) is elevated: [127,104,90,115], avg=109. I set L to default (promised=4) because concluded history confirms L=4. I set mu_hat using recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime; backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 samples = 5\xd7109 = 545 (approx) so orders target cover the review+lead horizon. I set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep lead time aligned with observed arrivals and raise target base stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained higher-demand regime while the cap limits excessive ordering and holding cost exposure.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 30: avg demand increased to 109 over Periods 30-33 (127,104,90,115) vs historical sample mean 38 (+187%), sustained 4 periods.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Current inventory: on-hand=72, in-transit=449 (total pipeline=521) so we are well-covered short-term. Use L=default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N N=4 to target the new high-demand regime (captures (1+L)\xd7mean of Periods 30-33). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base stock to meet elevated demand while the large pipeline reduces additional ordering aggressiveness, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=189, in-transit=316. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (many orders with W=4), so set L by calculation to reflect observed reality. Demand rose sharply starting Period 30 (periods 30-33: 127,104,90,115); to capture the new regime use recent_N=4 for demand mean and volatility (focus on the most recent sustained regime). These choices make mu_hat cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand and sigma_hat reflect recent variability, helping the OR backend set a higher base stock while keeping cap behavior for risk control. Pipeline + on-hand currently provides substantial cover but using recent demand avoids understocking during the sustained higher-demand regime.

On-hand=283 + in-transit=171 gives healthy coverage, but to protect service for the higher-demand regime I set L=default (use promised lead time=4) and forecast demand using the most recent regime: mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to capture the elevated demand pattern; sigma_hat recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the backend toward higher base stock to preserve service level during the confirmed higher-demand regime while relying on observed lead time stability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 (consistent concluded arrivals). Demand experienced a sustained high regime at Periods 30-33 (127,104,90,115 \u2192 avg 109) \u2014 this is the most relevant signal for stocking given continued elevated demand around that window. On-hand=232 + in-transit=135 provides healthy coverage, but to meet the higher-demand regime I bias the demand forecast to the recent high-demand regime (use recent_N). I keep L as default (promised = 4) because concluded arrivals repeatedly show 4. Using recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR base-stock on the high-demand regime so the backend increases target inventory to protect service while the capped order cap limits excessive single-period orders.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand regime: sustained high demand beginning Period 30 (Period30-33 demands 127,104,90,115; avg\u2248109 vs historical mean\u224838). On-hand=286, in-transit=0; promised lead time=4 and concluded arrivals historically confirm LT=4. To protect service under higher demand while controlling holding cost, keep L as default (promised=4) and set demand forecast to reflect the new regime using the most recent 4 periods. Use recent_N=4 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent high-demand regime.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods repeatedly (concluded arrivals consistently match ordered P -> P+4). A demand regime shift was observed starting Period 30 (Periods 30-33: 127,104,90,115; avg=109 vs historical sample mean ~38), so I use a short recent window to capture that higher-demand regime. Choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the most recent regime evidence (regime_length=4 -> N=4). This biases the base-stock toward the elevated demand seen in the regime while keeping lead-time treatment aligned with concluded arrivals. On-hand (253) + in-transit (70) is ample vs recent demands, so this will moderate ordering through the OR engine's capped policy.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=237, in-transit=110 \u2014 pipeline healthy, no overdue missing shipments. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 30 (recent weekly demands: 127,104,90,115). To capture the higher recent demand I set L to promised default=4 but estimate demand and volatility from the recent high-demand regime using recent_N=4 (the 4-period post-changepoint window) so the OR backend will raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while keeping lead-time as contracted.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 30 (periods 30-33 avg=109 vs historical sample mean ~38). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages. I set L to default (promised=4). To capture the new higher-demand regime, I use recent_N with N=12 (Periods 30-41) for mu_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent regime. For volatility, I use recent_N N=12 for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand variability rather than long-ago low-variance samples. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts in the higher-demand regime while keeping variability estimates aligned with recent data to limit excess holding.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=210, in-transit=173. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many confirmations). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 30 (avg \u2248109 over P30-33 vs historical mean ~38). Given confirmed LT=4 and the backend's base-stock formulation, use promised/default lead time so the OR engine aligns with observed arrivals; use default demand and volatility (all-sample) so the backend's estimator incorporates both pre- and post-shift data rather than overfitting a short recent window. This balances service (high recent demand) against holding cost given already-large on-hand + pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=270, in-transit=103. Historical lead times repeatedly observed = 4 periods so keep L = promised (default). Demand showed a past spike around Periods 30-33 but recent weeks (Periods 40-43) are low/moderate; to react to recent pattern I use a recent-N demand estimate to avoid overstock from earlier spike. Choose mu_hat recent_N with N=8 to capture the latest regime while smoothing noise. Keep sigma_hat default (uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (use recent demand) against holding cost given already-large on-hand position.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages; no evidence of loss currently. On-hand=298 + in-transit=63 provides strong coverage vs. recent elevated demand. A sustained demand regime shift began at Period 30 (higher mean); to capture that I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility with N equal to the regime length (Periods 30\u201344 = 15). L kept as default (promised=4) so backend uses advertised lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=15) to bias forecasts toward the new, higher-demand regime and balance service level against holding cost.

Profit/holding ratio implies high service target but recent demand has varied (including a Dec spike). Use promised/confirmed lead time (default) and aggregate historical demand (default mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR backend computes base stock from full-sample mean/variance, balancing service level and holding cost given current healthy on-hand plus in-transit.

Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=218, in-transit=34. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline appears healthy (on-hand + in-transit covers several weeks of current demand). Demand had a one-time regime spike around Periods 30-33 but recent weeks (Periods 35-46) show a return to moderate demand. To remain responsive to current demand while respecting confirmed lead time, set L via observed average; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the last 12 weeks to capture the current regime and avoid overreacting to the Sept spike. This balances high service (profit/holding -> q=0.8) against holding costs by forecasting demand based on recent actual sales instead of the full history spike.
