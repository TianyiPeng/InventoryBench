Demand analysis: recent observed demand P40\u2013P43 = 16,13,14,10 (avg \u224813/week) \u2014 current short-term demand is low. Lead time: supplier lead time already confirmed as 4 periods from prior concluded arrivals. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 289, in-transit = 0. With profit $4 and holding $1/period, carrying large inventory is costly; current on-hand covers many weeks even if holiday demand doubles. Ordering now would arrive after 4 periods (late for early holiday sales) and increase holding cost risk. Final order logic: place no order to avoid excess holding cost given large on-hand, confirmed lead time, and no urgent stockout risk.",

Demand analysis: recent demands P43\u2013P45 = 10,12,73 with a clear single-week spike in P45 (likely holiday-related but not yet a sustained regime change). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 204, in-transit = 0; any new order placed now would not arrive until Period 50 (4-period lead time) and therefore cannot help meet immediate holiday demand. Profit per unit = $4, holding cost = $1/period; carrying large ending inventory reduces objective. Decision logic: Do not place an order (0 units) because (a) current on-hand (204) is ample to meet expected near-term elevated demand and (b) ordered units arrive too late to affect the imminent holiday spike while incurring holding cost risks.",
