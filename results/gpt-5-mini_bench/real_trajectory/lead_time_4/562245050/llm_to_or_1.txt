Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals observed yet so cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (97,57,65,61,55) will be used as baseline; no sustained changepoint or seasonality evident in 5 samples. To balance service level vs holding cost, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/std multiplied by (1+L).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01) average ~67 units/week; on-hand=0, in-transit=96 (ordered P1) with no concluded arrivals yet (expected given promised lead time). No evidence of lead-time or demand regime change. Use promised lead time to avoid premature inference. Set L=default so backend uses promised L=4. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, balancing service level (captures multi-period demand) against holding cost conservatively given current zero on-hand and existing pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical weekly samples (2019-01) mean demand = 67 units. Recent concluded demands: P1=45, P2=77 \u2014 no sustained regime shift (only 2 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=189; promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet, so no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change. Use default lead time (promised=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean_all and sqrt(1+L)*std_all respectively; this yields a base-stock reflecting the long-run sample mean while accounting for promised lead time. This addresses current pipeline shortfall (expected demand over 5 periods > in-transit) without overreacting to noisy recent weeks.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Historical weekly demand samples (available seed) mean=67 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=283, and orders placed in Periods 1-3 have not concluded as arrivals by Period 4 \u2014 3 consecutive missed arrivals implies shipments are delayed or lost. To be conservative I set L explicit=7 to account for extended/delayed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (the five available samples) to anchor forecasts to observed weekly demand without over-weighting older priors; this yields mu_hat based on (1+L)*mean_recent. Volatility uses default to let backend scale std over (1+L). This combination aims to avoid over-ordering given large in-transit but uncertain arrivals while maintaining service by forecasting demand over the extended review+lead horizon.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 did not arrive by Period 4 conclude (3 consecutive missed arrivals), suggesting lead time > promised 4 or lost shipments; treat pipeline as unreliable until arrivals are observed.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Pipeline shows 406 in-transit but orders from Periods 1\u20133 failed to conclude by Period 4 (3 consecutive missed arrivals) indicating unreliable/extended lead time; treat in-transit as uncertain. I set L explicit=6 to conservatively lengthen lead time above promised 4 to cover potential delays while avoiding overcommitment. Demand has stepped up recently (period demands 45,77,134,124); I use recent_N N=4 for mu_hat to capture the latest regime. sigma_hat left as default to use overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices raise the base-stock to protect service level given delayed arrivals while keeping holding cost moderated by using observed recent demand rather than all-time higher smoothing.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=458. History shows a confirmed arrival: Period 5 conclude indicates 96 units ordered Period 1 arrived with lead_time=4. Recent demand has been elevated for 3 consecutive periods (P3=134, P4=124, P5=134), indicating a sustained higher-demand regime. To reflect confirmed lead time and the recent higher demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent 3-period regime (captures current mean/variance over the review+lead horizon). These parameters steer the OR engine to build a (1+L)-period forecast based on the elevated recent demand while acknowledging earlier pipeline unreliability is now partially resolved by the confirmed arrival.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5, lead_time=4); Demand regime shift starting Period3: recent avg = 130.7 (Periods 3-5) vs earlier sample mean ~67 (+~95%).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent history shows lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1\u2192arrived Period5, Period2\u2192arrived Period6). Demand regime shifted up starting Period3: recent demands (Periods 3-6) = [134,124,134,141], avg \u2248133.25 vs earlier ~67. On-hand=0, in-transit=506 (pipeline sizable but was unreliable earlier; now arrivals confirmed). I set L to default (promised 4, confirmed by arrivals). For demand I use recent_N=4 to capture the new higher regime (N equals regime length Periods3-6). sigma_hat uses recent_N=4 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters align base-stock to the higher demand while keeping holding cost modest (holding $1) and leverage confirmed lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand elevated: Periods 3-7 = [134,124,134,141,210], recent mean ~147. Deduce confirmed lead time=4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=557 \u2014 pipeline now substantial but was unreliable earlier; plan using observed LT=4 and recent demand regime. Set L by calculating average observed lead times (confirmed 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher post-changepoint demand (use last 5 periods to reflect new regime). Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility including the large spike in Period 7. This biases orders toward service (q=19/(19+1)=0.95) while keeping variability based on recent data to limit excess holding given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8 (Period 9). Recent demand has risen sharply vs earlier samples: Periods3-8 demands = [134,124,134,141,210,223], recent avg \u2248161.7 which confirms the regime shift that began in Period3. Pipeline shows in-transit=640 and on-hand=0; earlier missed arrivals resolved and arrivals in Periods5-8 confirm actual lead time=4. Set L via observed average lead times to match confirmed behavior. For demand forecast use a recent_N window covering the post-shift regime (last 6 periods) so mu_hat reflects elevated demand. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to capture current volatility. These choices align the OR base-stock calculation to a higher-demand regime while acknowledging reliable 4-period lead time and existing in-transit inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 3 (weekly demand much higher ~130s vs earlier ~60s). Current inventory: on-hand 0, in-transit 725 (several outstanding orders). Pipeline appears reliable now (multiple concluded arrivals showing lead_time=4). I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=7, covering Periods 3\u20139) to capture the new high-demand regime when forming (1+L)\xd7mean; same recent window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These params bias the OR base-stock toward higher cover for the elevated demand while using recent variance to avoid overstock from older low-demand samples.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Observed sustained actual lead_time=4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: orders on P1\u2013P6 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=817 \u2014 pipeline present but was previously unreliable; recent concluded history shows consistent L=4. Demand has shifted up starting around Period 3 and remained elevated (recent demands: P5\u2013P10 = 134,141,210,223,188,207); I select L by calculating the average observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the new high-demand regime. I choose N=8 to cover the recent elevated regime (Periods 3\u201310) while respecting the rule N \u2208 [3,20] and available samples. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts under confirmed L=4 and higher demand, while recent_N sigma captures increased volatility to temper over-ordering.

To meet elevated demand while accounting for observed lead time and limiting holding cost, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 3\u201311) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders toward service under the confirmed high-demand regime while keeping variability estimation recent so the OR engine's cap prevents excessive single-period ordering.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). Demand has been high and elevated since Period 3 (recent weeks show large, sustained demand: Periods 3-12 = [134,124,134,141,210,223,188,207,270,206]). On-hand=0, in-transit=887 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 10 observed demand periods (regime length Period3-12 = 10) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand volatility and mean; L set to calculated (observed average). This raises the base-stock to meet service during the 1+L review+lead window while sigma_hat recent_N tightens safety stock to current variability, balancing profit-driven service level (profit=$19 vs holding $1) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand has shifted up vs. early samples (sustained higher weekly sales since Period 3). On-hand=88 and in-transit=864 provide ample pipeline cover; prior missing-arrival concerns have been resolved by multiple concluded arrivals showing consistent lead_time=4. I therefore set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate to capture the new, higher-demand regime (use last 5 demand samples to reflect the recent pattern while keeping sample size \u22653). Volatility should also use recent_N with the same N to reflect current demand variability for the (1+L) review+lead period. These choices bias the OR engine toward provisioning for the higher recent demand while the large in-transit stock limits aggressive additional ordering, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=132, in-transit=861 \u2014 pipeline large and recent arrivals consistently show actual lead time=4. Demand regime increased starting Period 3 (sustained higher weekly demand). I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the post-changepoint higher-demand regime (use last 12 periods where demand has been elevated). For volatility (sigma_hat) I also use recent_N N=12 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while using observed lead time so the OR backend orders enough pipeline to cover the 1+L review+lead period without overstocking given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=117, in-transit=755. Historical concludes show consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 (orders from P1\u2192P5 etc.), and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 3: recent higher demand persists (Periods 3\u201315). Use an L inferred from observed lead times and recent-demand statistics to capture the new regime while acknowledging earlier missed arrivals are resolved. Choices: L by 'calculate' to lock to observed average lead time (4); mu_hat by 'recent_N' with N=13 to base (1+L)*mean on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 3\u201315); sigma_hat by 'recent_N' with N=13 to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while relying on confirmed LT=4 to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time = 4 periods, and recent demand has shifted higher; the last 5 observed weekly demands (Periods 12-16 = 206,145,189,199,237) average ~195.2. To reflect the confirmed lead time and the elevated recent demand regime while keeping variability grounded in recent experience, set L to the promised/default (4), and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent stable regime. This balances service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 3 (recent avg ~131 vs earlier ~67). On-hand=140, in-transit=758 \u2014 pipeline large but previously unreliable early on; lead-time observations (many concluded arrivals) consistently show 4-period actual lead time. I set L to calculate to let backend confirm observed avg lead time (will be ~4). For demand I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 3\u201317 inclusive) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=15 to capture volatility in the recent high-demand regime. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping safety stock aligned to observed variability; using recent data avoids diluting the forecast with the much lower pre-shift samples.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand elevated vs historical (recent 5-week mean \u2248190.6 vs early-sample mean \u224867). On-hand=229, in-transit=719 => sizeable pipeline but some earlier shipments were unreliable; however lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I set L=default to use the promised/observed 4-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the persistent higher-demand regime (uses last 5 demand samples, (P14-P18) mean \u2248190.6 \u2192 (1+L)*mean to size across review+lead). I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service against the confirmed higher demand while avoiding reliance on stale low-demand stats; keeping L=default leverages the confirmed 4-period pattern and treats the large in-transit as available to the OR engine.

LLM Rationale:

Concluded history shows consistent observed lead_time=4 (many orders with lead_time=4), and demand regime increased since Period 3 (recent weeks average ~196 units/week). Pipeline appears reliable (arrivals consistently match 4-period lag). I set L by calculating observed lead time history to lock in confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 15-19 mean \u2248196.4); mu_hat uses (1+L)\xd7recent mean to cover review+lead period. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Current on-hand=285, in-transit=668. Historical concludes show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed P1..P17 arrived with W=4), and demand has a sustained upward regime starting Period 3 (recent average \u2248130.7 vs early-sample mean \u224867). Earlier missing shipments (P1\u2013P3) were resolved and pipeline has been reliable since (multiple P arrivals with W=4). Given confirmed lead time=4 and a sustained higher-demand regime, I use an observed-lead-time estimate and recent-regime demand estimates so the OR backend targets the elevated mean and variance: L set to 'calculate' (uses observed lead times), mu_hat uses recent_N with N=19 to capture the post-change higher mean across the review+lead horizon, and sigma_hat uses recent_N with N=19 to capture current volatility. This raises the base stock to protect service level (profit/holding implies a high target service level) while relying on recent arrivals to justify replenishment rather than all-sample averages.

Recent demand has been variable but last 5 concluded period demands average ~140.6 \u2014 I use recent demand to capture the current regime while L is estimated from observed lead times. Choosing L=calculate to lock to observed average (4). Using mu_hat recent_N (N=5) gives (1+L)\xd7recent mean to reflect current demand level; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) captures recent volatility. This balances service (higher mu_hat for elevated recent demand) versus holding cost given substantial on-hand + in-transit.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand regime is elevated vs early-sample; last 5 weeks demand = [218,136,118,90,128], mean\u2248138 units/week. On-hand 390 + in-transit 451 = 841 units, which covers ~5*(138)=690 expected demand for (L+1)=5 periods so pipeline is adequate. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so use calculated lead time (confirming evidence). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the elevated demand regime and recent volatility, balancing service level (avoid stockouts) vs holding cost by basing base-stock on recent mean and recent variability.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand (Periods 20-24) averaged ~118/week; earlier historical mean (~67) is outdated and a demand regime shift was previously identified. Pipeline + on-hand = 748 units (525 on-hand + 223 in-transit), well above short-term expected demand, so we should avoid inflating orders. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. Therefore: set L using observed lead times (calculate), set mu_hat using recent_N (last 5 periods) to reflect the current higher-demand regime, and set sigma_hat using recent_N (last 5) to capture recent volatility. These choices align backend base-stock toward current demand while avoiding excess ordering given large on-hand+pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=542, in-transit=132. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and earlier demand regime shift (Periods 3-5) but recent 5-week demand has moderated (Periods 21-25 demand = 118,90,128,119,74; mean\u2248105.8). To keep replenishment responsive to recent demand while trusting promised lead time, I use default L=promised (4), set mu_hat based on the most recent 5 weeks to capture current demand level, and use recent volatility (N=5) for sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given pipeline uncertainty) against holding cost given high on-hand.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=592, in-transit=26 \u2014 ample stock vs recent subdued demand (last 5 weeks: 90,128,119,74,56). Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4. Promised L=4 is stable; use default L. To adapt to recent downward demand while still protecting service given high profit/low holding cost (q\u22480.95), use an EWMA for mu_hat to weight recent weeks more (gamma=0.3) so the backend reduces target stock gradually. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture current volatility. These choices balance high service target with evidence of lower recent demand and large on-hand inventory, avoiding aggressive additional ordering while allowing the OR backend to compute a high service z from profit/holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=521, in-transit=26. Historical concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift upward starting Period 3 (recent weeks much higher than early-sample mean). To reflect the confirmed LT=4 and recent higher demand, I set lead time method to use observed averages and base demand estimates on recent data (to capture the new regime and avoid understocking). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=20) lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 demand samples, balancing service level against holding cost given high profit/low holding cost.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent realized demand (Periods 24-28) averages ~78.6 units/week, much lower than the earlier spike (Period3-5). Pipeline has on-hand=474 and in-transit=261; no overdue arrivals beyond confirmed 4-period lead time in recent history. I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (4) since multiple concluded arrivals confirm L=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime reflected in the last five weeks; this keeps the base-stock aligned with current demand and reduces excess holding cost while preserving service. These parameters balance service level (using short-run demand) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=411, in-transit=261. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 for delivered shipments (many Period Z orders arrived in Z+4), although Periods 27-29 had some zero arrivals earlier indicating occasional missed shipments; overall recent pattern supports L=4. Recent demand (last 5 concluded weeks, Periods 25-29) = [74,56,71,73,63], mean \u224867.4 and moderate variability; demand has reverted from the earlier high spike and current regime appears lower. To target the OR backend base-stock while avoiding excess holding (holding cost low but nonzero), set L based on observed average lead time (calculate) and forecast demand using recent_N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime; compute sigma using recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep pipeline coverage aligned to observed deliveries and reduce overstating demand from earlier spike.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=341, in-transit=261. Historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4 (orders with W=4), so set L by calculate. Recent demand has dropped materially since Period 27 (Periods 27-30 demands = 71,73,63,70); I treat this as a new low-demand regime and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent N=4 samples to reflect current demand and lower variability. These parameters steer the OR engine toward a smaller base stock, reducing holding cost while preserving service for the current demand regime.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: avg demand decreased from ~130.7 (Periods 3-5) to 69.3 (Periods 27-30), a -47% change (Period27-30 mean=69.25).

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=289, in-transit=261. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in history; recent demand has shifted down starting Period 27 (periods 27-31 demands = 71,73,63,70,52). I set L=default (promised 4). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 (most recent 5 periods) so the OR engine builds base stock for the new lower mean with matching volatility; this reduces unnecessary holding cost while maintaining high service (profit/hc implies q\u22480.95).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (multiple arrivals showing 4-period lag). On-hand = 503, in-transit = 0; pipeline unreliable historically but now recent arrivals (Period32) restored expected 4-period cadence. Demand has settled into the lower regime observed from Period27 onward (~69/week). Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging confirmed LT=4 and full sample history. This keeps ordering conservative given high on-hand and low holding cost vs profit, letting backend cap orders appropriately.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has settled lower after the previously recorded drop at Period 27: last 8 concluded demands (Periods 27-34) = [71,73,63,70,52,47,69,47], avg \u2248 62.5. On-hand=387, in-transit=234 (pipeline contains stock but has had intermittent gaps earlier). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 when shipments arrive, so set lead time by observed data. I choose recent_N for demand mean/volatility using the last 8 periods to capture the current lower regime; sigma_hat also recent_N over same window. These parameters keep base-stock sized to the current lower-demand regime and avoid overstock while the pipeline remains nonzero.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 27 (Period27-35 average ~69), current on-hand=356 + in-transit=234 = 590 units which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand at the lower regime. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 4). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime I use recent_N (N=9, Period27-35) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock to the recent mean and volatility and avoids overstocking from earlier high-demand samples. This balances service (covering ~5 periods lead+review) versus holding cost given large current inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand regime is the lower regime identified at Period 27 (mean \u224869.3). On-hand=508, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for several weeks; pipeline previously unreliable but lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4. Set L to default (promised 4) since observed lead time=4 is well supported. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the lower-demand regime (capture most of the post-changepoint data). Chosen N=11 (periods 27\u201337 inclusive) to cover the sustained lower-demand regime while meeting the N selection rule; this keeps the base_stock aligned to current lower mean and reduces excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=469, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 periods; recent demand has settled into the lower regime that began at Period 27 (recent 12-week mean ~69 -> current weekly mean lower around ~45). Use calculated lead time to reflect observed history and recent_N for demand moments to capture the down-shifted regime (use last 12 samples from the current regime). This reduces unnecessary ordering/holding while preserving service given confirmed L=4.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent history shows the lower-demand regime beginning at Period 27 (Period27-30 mean ~69.25) persists through latest concludes (Period 36-39 demands = 40,42,39,46). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals with lead_time=4). I therefore use promised/default L to keep backend expectations aligned with observed confirmations. For demand I use recent_N with N=13 (covering the sustained low-demand regime since Period27 \u2014 regime length \u224813 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the newer lower mean and volatility rather than the much higher earlier regime. These parameters reduce excess ordering and holding cost while maintaining service during the sustained lower-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=364, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline currently empty. Recent demand has been in the lower regime since Period 27 (Period27-40 demands average ~52\u201371, recent weeks 31-40 averaging ~44), so I shrink forecast to reflect the lower regime to avoid excess holding cost. Set L to default (promised = 4, confirmed by concluded history). Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent low-demand regime (reduces mean and volatility vs. long-run samples) so the OR backend will lower target base-stock and cap orders, preserving service while limiting holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/25 (Period 42). On-hand=338, in-transit=0; pipeline unreliable previously but lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in history). Recent sustained demand regime is the lower regime starting Period 27 (demand declined ~47% vs earlier). I set L to default (promised=4) because observed arrivals consistently match 4 in concluded history. For demand I use recent_N with N=15 (Periods 27\u201341 constitute the current low-demand regime, length=15) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 15 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=15 to capture current volatility. This keeps the base-stock target tied to the confirmed lower-demand regime, avoids overstock given high holding cost relative to profit, and accounts for the reliable 4-period lead time evident in concluded arrivals. Pipeline=0 so orders should cover (1+L) periods of expected demand.

Demand regime dropped starting Period 27 (periods 27-30 mean ~69), so use recent demand to reflect the lower steady demand rather than older high-demand regime. Set L to promised (default=4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=16 (captures Periods 27\u201342 regime length ~16 weeks, within 3\u201320 cap) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and recent volatility, avoiding carryover of the earlier high-demand regime and reducing excess holding risk given current on-hand.

On-hand=178, in-transit=97 (pipeline contains some late arrivals historically but lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4). Use promised lead time (default) since observed lead time =4 is well-supported. To align forecast with the sustained lower-demand regime, use recent_N (N=4) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat, anchoring to the most recent low-demand regime samples (Period27-30). This reduces over-ordering and holding cost while keeping service given current pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). Historical concludes consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (many P->P+4 arrivals); pipeline has on-hand=141, in-transit=238. Demand regime dropped around Period 27 and has remained lower vs earlier high-demand regime; recent weekly demand shows modest volume with occasional spikes (e.g. P42=130). Given stable confirmed lead time=4, I keep L at promised (default). To adapt to the lower recent demand regime while still reacting to short-term variation, I use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat based on the most recent observations (N=8) to capture the current regime without over-weighting older high-demand periods. I retain default for sigma_hat so volatility is estimated from full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This combination reduces excess ordering from older high-demand data while allowing the OR backend (with high service quantile q\u22480.95) to maintain service with reasonable safety stock.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent history: confirmed lead time = 4 in prior periods; inventory healthy (on-hand=105, in-transit=360) but demand has downshifted since Period 27 (earlier carry-over recorded). Last five observed demands (Periods 41-45) = [26,130,30,37,36] show no sustained return to the earlier high regime and include a one-off spike (P42=130). To be robust to the short-term variability while reflecting the lower post-Period-27 regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=5 (captures the most recent mix including the spike) so the backend computes (1+L)*recent_mean. I keep L=default to trust the promised lead time (prior conclusions confirm L=4) and use sigma_hat=default so upstream volatility is estimated from full-sample variability. This balances service (using recent demand signal) against holding cost given substantial on-hand + in-transit inventory and low holding cost.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=86, in-transit=400. Past carry-over shows demand regime shift down at Period 27 (Period27-30 mean\u224869.3) and no subsequent sustained change; shipments historically follow promised L=4. To reflect the lower post-Period-27 demand regime, I use recent_N over the most recent 20 weeks (regime length \u224820). Keeping L as default (promised) because concluded messages confirm 4-period arrivals historically and there is no new sustained lead-time shift. Recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR backend targets the current lower-demand regime and balances service level vs. holding cost given large pipeline.
