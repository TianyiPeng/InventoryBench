Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 246, in-transit = 411 (these in-transit units were ordered in Period 44 and will arrive per the observed 4-period lead time). Demand outlook: recent six-week demand (P39\u2013P44) averages \u2248108/week with a one-off spike (P42=215) likely holiday-driven; overall demand is elevated vs long-run but not higher than pipeline+on-hand capacity. Coverage check: (L+1)=5 period demand \u22485\xd7108\u2248540 units; current on-hand + in-transit = 657 units, which comfortably covers the coming review+lead horizon. Cost tradeoff: profit = $19/unit >> holding cost = $1/unit/period, but ordering now risks excess holding once short elevated holiday demand subsides; given ample pipeline and confirmed lead time, no additional order is needed. OR recommended 0 units; I follow it because pipeline + on-hand already exceed the (L+1)-period demand buffer and lead time is confirmed at 4. Final decision: order 0 units.",
