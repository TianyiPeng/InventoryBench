Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand 0, in-transit 0. Historical weekly demand samples (early Jan) show mean ~133. Use promised lead time (default L=4) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time and no sustained demand regime change is evident. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=178 (order placed P1 not yet concluded) and promised lead time=4. Historical weekly mean demand=133 (5 samples). The P1 order showing arrived=0 is expected because promised L=4 implies arrival later; no evidence yet of lost shipments or lead-time change. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (no concluded lead-time observations to infer otherwise). For demand forecast use mu_hat=default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures 5-period coverage). Use sigma_hat=default so backend scales historical demand volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices balance service level (cover L+1 periods) against holding cost while awaiting any confirmed lead-time or demand-regime shifts.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent concluded demand shows an uptick (P1 demand=156, P2=207) versus Jan historical mean (\u2248133). On-hand=0, in-transit=358 \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet (promised lead time=4). I keep L as default (use promised 4) because we have insufficient concluded arrivals to confirm a lead-time change. To capture the recent demand increase while being conservative, I use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat (last 3 demand observations) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean of the most recent 3 samples. I use default for sigma_hat to avoid overfitting variance with limited recent data. These choices push the OR engine toward higher base stock to cover the apparent demand rise while relying on promised lead time and standard volatility estimate to balance service level vs holding cost. No new confirmed lost-shipment or lead-time insight.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=583. Historical weekly demand samples (5): mean=133, std\u224824.1. No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unobserved; use promised lead time. Set L=default (promised 4). Use mu_hat=default => (1+L)*mean_all = 5*133 to capture expected demand over review+lead period. Use sigma_hat=default to reflect observed volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps the OR backend's base-stock tied to historical weekly demand while accounting for the 5-period coverage, and avoids overreacting to unconfirmed late/missing arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent concluded periods show consistent weekly demand samples (historic weekly sample mean=133 units). On-hand=0, in-transit=792 (sum of recent orders) and no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 this is expected given promised lead time=4 (orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 would conclude later). No sustained changepoint or lost-shipment evidence (not enough periods past promised lead time to declare losses). Use promised lead time and population demand stats: set L to default (promised), mu_hat to default to capture (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, and sigma_hat to default so the OR engine computes safety stock from full-sample volatility. This balances service (reasonable base stock for 5-period coverage) vs holding cost by letting the OR backend apply the profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Daily Reward (R_t): $617.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent conclude shows the Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (lead_time=4). On-hand=19, in-transit=662; pipeline plus on-hand covers multiple weeks but arrivals only just began. Use promised/confirmed lead time of 4. Demand history (samples mean=133) indicates no detected demand regime change; use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap with standard estimates. This balances service (cover 5 periods of demand) vs holding cost given high pipeline.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent realized weekly demand (P1-P6 = 156,207,179,187,159,169) is materially above the older Jan samples; on-hand=30, in-transit=640 (total pipeline+on-hand=670) which is ample but demands appear elevated. Lead time observed consistently as 4 in concluded history, so use calculated L from observations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to reflect the elevated recent demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend sizes base-stock and caps to meet higher short-term demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concluded history shows arrivals consistent with a 4-period lead time (Period 5: P1\u2192P5, Period 6: P2\u2192P6, Period 7: P3\u2192P7). On-hand = 91, in-transit = 623 which plus on-hand covers multiple periods of demand. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) have mean=133; with promised/observed L=4 I use the default demand aggregation to let the OR engine compute base_stock and cap using full-sample stats. Using defaults keeps parameters consistent with confirmed lead time and leverages all available demand history while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise; this balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=125, in-transit=543 gives ample coverage vs historical weekly demand (~134 mean from samples). Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use calculate for L to reflect observed lead times. Demand signal shows no recent regime shift (recent concluded demands 159,169,164,175 are close to historical sample mean), so use default mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let OR backend compute base-stock while accounting for confirmed lead time. This prioritizes service (profit>holding) without overreacting to noise; no new missing-shipment evidence.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders placed in P1\u2013P5 arrived in P5\u2013P9 with W=4), on-hand=59 plus in-transit=675 gives large pipeline coverage. Demand history (samples provided) mean ~133/week; with promised lead time 4 I set lead time method to calculate (backend will confirm average observed lead time=4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples \u2014 this leverages full historical seed while the calculate L ensures the review+lead period is correct. This combination keeps base-stock tied to observed demand while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise given large pipeline; it balances service level (captures 5-period demand) versus holding cost by not inflating sigma or mu beyond historical averages.

Daily Reward (R_t): $868.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=617. Concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals (orders placed P1..P6 arrived after 4 periods), so actual lead time is stable at 4. I select L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times. Demand has risen recently (recent demands: 156,207,179,187,159,169,164,175,114,219) with a high last-week spike (219); to capture this recent regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 (uses last 10 observed demand samples). This increases base-stock and safety stock to match a high service-level target (profit $4 vs holding $1 -> q=0.8) while reflecting recent volatility.

On-hand=0, in-transit=630 \u2014 pipeline slightly below the (1+L)-period demand implied by historical mean. Use calculated lead time from observed history to reflect confirmed L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample estimates) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) with holding cost given limited pipeline and confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1-P8 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=737 which exceeds the default (1+L)*mean historical weekly demand (historical mean=133 \u2192 (1+4)*133=665), so pipeline currently covers expected demand over review+lead. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual LT=4 (method: calculate). For demand forecast and volatility I use defaults so the OR engine computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples); this leverages the provided historical samples while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time and avoids overreacting to recent stockouts. This balances service level (covering lead+review periods) versus holding cost given in-transit coverage is already modestly above the forecasted need.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history (Periods 5-13) consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods and no missing arrivals; on-hand=0, in-transit=739. Base demand samples (historic weekly samples provided) have mean 133 units/week. Promised L=4 is confirmed by concluded arrivals, so I use default lead time. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (captures longer review+lead demand and observed variability). This balances service (covering 5 weeks of mean demand) against holding cost given profit=4 and holding=1 by letting backend set z* and cap.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent realized demand rose sharply starting Period 5 (weekly demands P5\u2013P14: 159,169,164,175,114,219,267,198,197,222) vs historical Jan samples (mean=133). On-hand=0, in-transit=826 (sizable pipeline). Promised lead time is 4 and prior conclude evidence confirmed L=4. I therefore: set L to default (use promised 4); set mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 10 concluded demand samples P5\u2013P14); set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward serving the elevated demand while using the observed pipeline to avoid overordering given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple P arrive messages). On-hand=23, in-transit=801 \u2014 large pipeline already covers several periods of demand. Demand history samples (Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~133/wk; with promised/confirmed L=4 we use default population-based forecast to let OR backend compute base stock. Using defaults avoids overreacting to high in-transit and preserves service level while containing holding cost given current large pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=34, in-transit=687. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. Pipeline (687) plus on-hand covers multiple future periods; no recent lost shipments evident. To align OR backend with observed lead time, set L via calculate (uses observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full history and yields a conservative base-stock given high in-transit volume. These choices balance service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). On-hand=62, in-transit=743. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed Period 6 insight). Recent demand (last 17 weeks) hovers between ~114\u2013267 with several weeks >190, indicating a moderately high recent mean vs the small 5-sample Jan history. I keep L at the promised/default (4) consistent with confirmed observations. For demand I use recent_N=10 to capture the most recent regime and avoid old Jan samples; N=10 balances responsiveness and variance smoothing. I use recent_N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock upward relative to the tiny Jan sample mean, improving service given large in-transit volume while still accounting for holding cost (profit/holding = 4).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent concluded history (Periods 5-18) consistently shows actual lead time = 4. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan-Feb) have mean 133 units; with promised L=4 the (1+L) demand horizon = 5 weeks \u2192 baseline expected demand \u2248 665. Current on-hand 103 + in-transit 815 = 918 units, which comfortably covers the 5-week demand horizon and provides buffer for variability. Therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock sizing using all samples; this avoids overreacting to normal week-to-week noise while honoring observed lead time and limiting holding cost given current ample pipeline.

This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by keeping replenishment driven by multi-period mean and observed lead time.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=372, in-transit=463 => pipeline+on-hand = 835 units, which covers several periods of demand given historical weekly mean ~133. I choose L=default (use promised lead time=4) because concluded messages confirm promised LT. For demand I choose mu_hat=default to use (1+L)*mean(all samples)=5\xd7mean, leveraging the historical weekly mean (113,141,104,173,134) for a stable baseline; sigma_hat=default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples).

To let the OR backend use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats while preserving conservative service, I select default methods so backend computes (1+L)*mean and volatility from all samples.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=336, in-transit=462. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead time; demand samples (Jan-Feb) mean=133/wk. Promised L=4 confirmed\u2014use default to keep OR backend assumptions aligned. Using mu_hat default yields (1+L)*mean_all_samples = 5*133=665, which reflects expected demand over review+lead window. sigma_hat default keeps volatility based on all samples (scaled by sqrt(1+L)). Current on-hand + pipeline (798) comfortably covers several weeks of expected demand, so no aggressive upshift; defaults balance service level and holding cost given stable historical demand and confirmed lead time.

Current on-hand=400 + in-transit=415 => pipeline covers multiple weeks of demand (total 815 units), so use promised/default lead time and population-wide demand stats. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=463, in-transit=358. Historical conclude messages (Periods 5-26) consistently show orders arriving 4 periods after ordering, confirming actual lead time = 4. Demand history (multiple periods) aligns with pre-sample mean; no recent changepoint detected. Use L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time average; use default forecasting (all-sample mean scaled by (1+L)) for mu_hat and default volatility scaling for sigma_hat. This keeps the OR backend aligned with confirmed lead time and uses full-sample demand stats to balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent concluded history shows consistent realized lead time = 4 and stable weekly demand levels (historical sample mean 133 units/week from provided samples). Current inventory: on-hand=489, in-transit=333 (no overdue/lost shipments evident). I choose default methods: keep L as promised (4) because observed lead time equals promise; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This yields conservative replenishment based on full-sample demand and the confirmed lead time, balancing service level (protecting against stockouts over the 5-period horizon) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weekly demands remain low relative to early-year samples; historical sample mean = 133/week. On-hand=486, in-transit=286 \u2192 pipeline=772 units which exceeds (1+L) expected demand (~665 units), so no aggressive ordering needed. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior history; using default lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean) provides stable base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost by targeting coverage of L+1 periods. Sigma set to default to reflect historical variability.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=526, in-transit=272 (total pipeline=798) which currently covers projected demand for multiple weeks; historical weekly samples show no recent sustained demand regime change. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates (all-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L)). This keeps the OR backend anchored to long-run demand while the large pipeline avoids immediate stockouts; defaults balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent weeks show subdued demand (~50-100/week) vs. earlier spring peaks; on-hand=551, in-transit=249 provides strong coverage vs. typical weekly demand. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. I select L=default to use promised (and empirically confirmed) 4-period lead time. I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available demand samples, keeping policy stable given no recent sustained regime shift. This keeps service level high while the backend's cap limits orders to avoid excessive ordering against current high on-hand + in-transit.

Historical sample mean (provided) \u2248133 units/week; demand appears stable with no new sustained regime shifts and on-hand + pipeline substantially exceed recent weekly demand. I therefore use the defaults (promised lead time and full-sample demand stats) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this is conservative and avoids overreacting to short-term noise while letting the optimizer trade service level vs holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan 2019) mean=133 units; recent concluded history shows steady demand decline since summer but no new sustained regime change. On-hand=592 + in-transit=210 >> typical (1+L)*mean demand, so current pipeline is ample and no overdue/lost shipments are evident. Use promised lead time (default L=4) consistent with observed arrivals. Set mu_hat to default so backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples (5*133=665) capturing baseline demand over review+lead. Use sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) for risk buffer. These choices keep the OR engine conservative (sufficient base-stock to preserve service while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock given high on-hand inventory).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Pipeline (766) covers the (L+1) horizon comfortably, so use default forecasting (promised/confirmed lead time and full-sample stats).

LLM Rationale:

Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods (recorded earlier). I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and let the OR engine compute base-stock and caps from full-sample statistics (default) so it leverages all historical demand data and the confirmed L=4 while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise. This balances service (high on-hand coverage) against holding costs given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Demand historical samples (seed) are the five Jan 2019 weekly values; no strong recent upward/downward regime shift in demand observed (recent weeks show low steady demand). Given confirmed lead time and abundant on-hand stock, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock and caps from the full-sample statistics.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=641, in-transit=105 \u2014 inventory is ample vs recent demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 (observed repeatedly since P5), so set L to calculated average (confirms actual=promised). Use default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) based on all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to keep the OR backend's baseline forecast; with high on-hand this avoids aggressive ordering while preserving service level via the backend's safety-stock cap.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=633, in-transit=121 (pipeline=754). Carry-over confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (from Period 6). Using default lead time keeps promised L=4 consistent with observed arrivals. Demand historical samples (Jan 2019 weekly mean=133) will be used by backend; therefore select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This leverages the established lead time and lets the OR engine balance service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) via its internal q calculation while our high on-hand+pipeline already covers multiple (L+1) periods of expected demand, reducing risk from delayed arrivals.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in carry-over). Current on-hand=644 + in-transit=93 = 737 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods at historical mean demand (~133\u21925\xd7133=665). No overdue/lost shipments observed recently. I use default lead time (promised/confirmed 4) and default demand estimates based on all historical samples so the OR backend applies the standard base-stock calculation and caps\u2014this balances service (covering 5-period demand) versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=666, in-transit=84 \u2014 inventory is ample versus recent weekly demand (historical sample mean ~133). Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods; no recent evidence of lost shipments or demand regime change. Use default lead time and default demand statistics so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples, producing conservative replenishment given high on-hand to avoid excess holding cost.

On-hand=668, in-transit=70; pipeline plus on-hand is ample vs. recent weekly demand. I retain promised lead time and use default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean, sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples) to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap\u2014this avoids overreacting to short-term noise and balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been low relative to earlier year: historical sample mean ~133/week (from provided seed samples). On-hand = 684 and in-transit = 38 (total available >> expected demand over lead+review), and prior conclude history confirms actual lead time = 4. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and volatility using all samples. This conservative choice avoids unnecessary new orders while holding adequate inventory to meet demand and maintain service given profit/holding tradeoff (q=0.8). No evidence of a new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time that would justify changing the defaults.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Recent demand has fallen sharply versus the early-sample mean: Periods 36-45 weekly demand series shows low single/double-digit weeks (recent 10-period demands: 43,25,32,9,12,42,12,7,19,? \u2014 overall recent mean ~20) vs. historical sample mean (~133). On-hand=642 and in-transit=44 far exceed expected demand over (1+L) periods, so I will use a recent-window forecast to capture the lower current regime and a calculated lead time based on observed concludes (confirmed L=4). I choose L by "calculate" to reflect observed lead-time=4 from concluded arrivals. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 10 demand observations, which down-weights the high early-year values and prevents the OR engine from over-ordering given current low demand and large on-hand stock. This reduces target base stock and cap, limiting new receipts and minimizing holding cost while preserving service given current low demand.
