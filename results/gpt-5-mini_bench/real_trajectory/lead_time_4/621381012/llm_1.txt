{
  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23 (week of Christmas) \u2014 apparel demand often softens just before/after holiday peak; recent realised demand is low. Historical recent demands: P43=20, P44=29, P45=26 \u2192 3-week average \u224825 units/week. On-hand=251, in-transit=0, supplier lead time previously confirmed = 4 periods. Profit $4/unit vs holding $1/unit/period means holding is costly; with current low demand and large on-hand stock, placing orders risks heavy holding cost and lower reward. No evidence of incoming shipments; pipeline empty. Decision: do not order this period to avoid excess holding cost while existing inventory can cover many weeks of current demand (251 / 25 \u2248 10 weeks).",
