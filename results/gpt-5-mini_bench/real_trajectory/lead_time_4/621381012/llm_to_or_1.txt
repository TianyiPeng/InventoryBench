Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). No on-hand or in-transit inventory and no concluded arrivals => cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Historical weekly samples: [0,24,29,37,41], mean=26.2. With promised L=4, (1+L)=5 so baseline demand across review+lead \u2248131 units (5\xd726.2); volatility scaled by \u221a(1+L). Chosen default methods keep the OR engine's baseline demand and risk estimates (covers L+1 periods) while avoiding premature adjustments given zero concluded lead-time evidence or short history.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~26.2/week; on-hand=0, in-transit=53 (ordered Period 1) and no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Promised lead time (4) remains the best baseline. Use default demand estimates so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std; this balances service level against holding cost given limited evidence of regime or lead-time change and the existing in-transit volume.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=106 (two orders of 53) and no concluded arrivals yet; promised lead time is 4 and there is no evidence shipments are lost or lead time has changed. Historical weekly demand mean ~26.2 (5 samples); use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this keeps parameters anchored to full-sample history while the in-transit pipeline covers upcoming periods.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. On-hand=0, In-transit=168; no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed earlier show arrived=0), so cannot infer lead-time different from promised. Recent demand (Periods 1-3) is substantially higher than older historical sample mean. I keep L at promised (default) because there is no concluded evidence to change lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime (last three demands: 37, 58, 51) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last3). For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize meeting the higher observed demand while keeping safety stock scaled to recent variability, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected in recent periods (Periods 1-3): recent avg=48.67 vs prior sample avg=26.20 (+86%), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand clearly elevated: last 4 weekly demands = [37,58,51,57], recent mean = 50.75, sustained for 4 periods. No concluded arrivals yet (in-transit=235), so cannot infer shorter/longer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Set L=default to let backend assume promised 4. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the detected higher-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std will be computed by backend). This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given strong recent demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering aggressiveness.

Daily Reward (R_t): $167.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Observed arrival in Period 5 confirms actual lead time = 4 (order from P1 arrived in P5). Recent demand (Periods 2-5 = 58,51,57,44) remains elevated versus older samples, so I bias forecasts to the most recent regime. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (avg=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 (captures the sustained higher-demand regime) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend builds base_stock around the new higher mean and updated volatility, balancing service level (profit/holding ratio) against holding costs. No new carry-over insights beyond prior regime shift.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = promised 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6 each W=4). On-hand=4 + in-transit=213 -> pipeline ample but some units still in-transit; no evidence of lost shipments for recent observed orders. Recent demand regime persists (higher recent weekly demand). I therefore keep L at default (promised 4) but set demand estimates using recent data to reflect the sustained higher demand: use recent_N with N=3 (last 3 periods: Periods 4-6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, improving service levels vs holding cost under the new regime.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized demand is elevated (recent demands: P5=44, P6=58, P7=56) relative to older samples; on-hand=10 and in-transit=214 provide ample coverage but we must use a demand estimate reflecting the new higher regime. Observed arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Therefore: set L via calculate to capture observed lead-time average; set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to target the (1+L)-period demand under the confirmed higher regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability. This balances service (higher mu_hat to avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand regime persists: last 3 concluded demands = 44,58,56,60 (recent average \u2248 54.5; prior sample mean 26.2 showed large shift). On-hand=17, in-transit=201 (sufficient pipeline for multiple periods). Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history. To react to the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility (N=3) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the higher recent mean and variability while keeping L as promised (confirmed). This will raise the base-stock to improve service during the new regime while avoiding overreaction beyond the 3-period confirmed shift.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15. Recent demand has been elevated and sustained (Periods 5-9 demands = 44,58,56,60,39; recent mean = 51.4). On-hand=15, in-transit=226 \u2192 pipeline=241 units which covers most of the (L+1)=5 period demand but slightly below 5*recent mean (\u2248257). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; use promised lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and volatility reflecting the new regime. Sigma uses recent_N to reflect recent volatility. This balances higher service level from elevated demand against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand has been elevated vs the historical 2019 samples; last 6 demands (Periods 5\u201310) = [44,58,56,60,39,23], mean=46.67. On-hand=39 + in-transit=213 => pipeline=252. Using promised lead time (default) L=4 because lead time was previously confirmed as 4. Set mu_hat to recent_N (N=6) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime: (1+L)*mean(last6)=5*46.67\u2248233.3 expected demand over review+lead. Set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent demand volatility. With pipeline (252) slightly above the 5-period demand forecast (~233), this posture avoids unnecessary additional ordering while letting the OR backend compute the precise order given service/holding tradeoff.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=68, in-transit=159. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). Recent demand regime shows sustained uplift (Periods 1-3 avg=48.67 vs prior 26.20). To respect confirmed lead time and the higher recent demand, set L using calculated observed lead times, use recent_N=3 for mu_hat to capture the new regime ( (1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples ), and recent_N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters increase target base stock to avoid stockouts given the higher demand while keeping variability estimate focused on the new regime.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand elevated vs early-sample (recent weeks averaging markedly higher); current on-hand=96 + in-transit=105 => total pipeline=201, which comfortably covers multiple weeks but we must maintain buffer given confirmed 4-period lead time. Use L=default (promised lead time=4, confirmed by prior concludes). Use mu_hat recent_N to focus forecast on the recent higher-demand regime (capture last 8 weeks that include the elevated demand periods). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=8) to reflect recent volatility rather than older low-demand variance. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base-stock appropriate for the sustained higher demand while keeping variability estimates responsive to recent behavior.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=126, in-transit=82; no currently overdue shipments visible. Recent observed lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed in history), so keep L as promised. Recent demand (Periods 11-13) shows a new, lower regime (34,26,32); I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the current lower mean and reduce excess stocking. Volatility likewise set to recent_N N=3 to reflect recent variability. These choices lower target base-stock and cap ordering to balance profit vs holding cost given the demand decline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 11: avg decreased from 48.67 to 30.67 (-36.9%) based on Periods 11-13 (34,26,32).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=87, in-transit=48 => pipeline=135. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders P1\u2192P5 ... P10\u2192P14). I set L=calculate to lock in observed lead time (4). Demand recently dropped around Periods 11-13 (avg\u224830.7) but Period 14 spiked to 73; to balance recent volatility vs. longer-run mean I use an EWMA demand forecast (gamma=0.5) to smooth the spike while still giving weight to recent lower demand. sigma_hat left as default to reflect overall observed variability. These choices keep base stock responsive to recent regime changes while avoiding overreaction to a single spike; pipeline + order target will cover (1+L) periods of expected demand.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Recent demand (Periods 11-15 = 34,26,32,73,67) shows a renewed uptick vs the lower regime identified at P11; this spike is recent and volatile so use a short recent window to let backend adapt. Set L by calculated average of observed lead times (returns 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures last 5 demands) so (1+L)-period forecast and volatility reflect the recent surge while avoiding overcommitment given substantial pipeline. This balances service (respond to higher recent demand) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03): on-hand=0, in-transit=203. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 14-16 = 73,67,52) is materially higher than the earlier low-regime (Periods 11-13 = 34,26,32). I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed = 4). For demand I use a recent_N=3 forecast to capture the new higher regime (use last 3 weeks' avg over the review+lead horizon) and match volatility estimate to those same 3 periods. This biases orders up to avoid stockouts given sizable in-transit but zero on-hand, trading extra holding cost for higher profit service.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg increased from 30.67 (Periods 11-13) to 64.00 (Periods 14-16), +109% (34,26,32 -> 73,67,52).

Recent demand has shifted up starting Period 14; last 4 demands = 73,67,52,92 (mean=71) with elevated volatility. To capture the new higher-demand regime while relying on confirmed lead time, set L to calculated average (4) and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility over the most recent 4 periods.

Choose L by calculating observed lead times to confirm 4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast and volatility responsive to the current high-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to one-off spikes.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent demands (Periods 17-19) = [92,92,111] show a sustained high regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=328 (pipeline large). Promised lead time historically confirmed as 4. Use L: default to keep promised 4. For demand and volatility use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (periods 17-19) so the OR backend sizes base stock to cover elevated demand while respecting the pipeline; sigma recent_N captures recent variability. This balances higher service needs (profit>holding) against holding cost by raising target stock to meet current elevated demand but relying on pipeline to avoid excess immediate orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17-19: avg increased from 64.00 (Periods 14-16) to 95.00 (+48.4%) based on Periods 17-19 demands [92,92,111].

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1 (Period 21). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (observed P1\u2192P5 ... P16\u2192P20). Recent demand regime is high but volatile: last 3 realized demands = [92,111,46] (Periods 18-20) indicating elevated short-run mean. On-hand=37 and large pipeline=362 (total pipeline inventory covers multiple (L+1) periods), so avoid aggressive additional ordering. I set L to 'calculate' to lock to the observed average lead time (4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures the recent high/volatile demand) so the OR engine orders only to top up pipeline relative to current short-term demand expectations and thus balance service vs holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand (Periods 20-22 = 46,72,67) shows a new, lower short-run regime vs prior high spike (Periods 17-19). On-hand =79 and in-transit=298 provide ample pipeline (covers multiple (L+1)=5-periods of demand at recent rates); to respond to the recent downward shift while keeping service, I use promised lead time and short-window recent estimates (N=3) for mu and sigma so the OR engine reduces target base-stock from the prior high-rate setting and limits excess holding cost given holding $1/unit. This balances service (high profit $4) against holding costs and accounts for confirmed LT=4.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand is volatile with a one-period spike in P23 (114) but no 3+ period sustained change; historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4. Inventory: on-hand=29, in-transit=234 (pipeline=263) \u2014 ample coverage vs short-term demand but recent high demands justify using the latest observations. Set L to promised (default=4). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (Periods 21-23: demands 72,67,114) so the OR engine raises target stock to protect service during recent elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to a single older period.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals P1\u2192P5 ... P20\u2192P24), so use calculate to lock to observed average. Recent demand shows a short-term regime with higher variability \u2014 last 3 concluded demands (Periods 22-24) = [67,114,55], recent avg=78.67 over (1+L) review+lead window implies using recent_N with N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend emphasizes recent demand spike while keeping pipeline-aware orders. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by sizing base stock from the recent regime and reflecting increased volatility in sigma_hat.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). On-hand=19, in-transit=273 (pipeline=292) \u2014 ample pipeline but recent demand has been volatile: Periods 24-26 demands = [55,73,116]. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4. I use L=default to keep promised lead time (matches observed). Demand appears to have shifted upward in the last 3 periods; I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new short-term regime ((1+L) multiplier applied by backend). This keeps safety stock responsive to the recent spike while backend caps order size. 

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 24-26: avg increased to 81.33 (Periods 24-26 = 55,73,116) from prior 61.67 (+31.6%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/08/19 (Period 28). On-hand=0, in-transit=406. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. Recent demand has spiked (Periods 25-27 = 73,116,173); this appears to be a new high-demand regime but is only 3 periods so treat recent 3 as primary signal. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms LT=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current high regime: mu_hat will be computed as (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands) which gives the OR engine a forecast covering review+lead. I also use recent_N (N=3) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These settings push the base-stock up to satisfy elevated short-term demand while the cap will limit extreme over-ordering; using recent_N keeps responsiveness to the apparent surge without permanently overwriting long-run stats.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates from the most recent 3 periods to capture the current elevated mean and volatility so the OR backend raises base-stock appropriately while the capped order limit prevents extreme single-period orders.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand spike: last 3 concluded demands = 173,194,150 (avg 172.33) \u2014 sustained high demand over 3 periods. Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so use default L. To capture the current high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (captures the most recent regime while meeting the minimum N and regime-length rules). This biases the base-stock upward to protect service during the spike while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility; large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=774. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods. Recent demand has jumped sharply: last 4 demands (P27-30) = [173,194,150,195], avg \u2248178, a sustained high regime vs prior avg \u224881. I set L=default (use promised/confirmed 4). I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (use the most recent 4 periods to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility), which increases service level to avoid stockouts while letting OR cap limit extreme overordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27-30: avg increased to 178.0 (Periods 27-30 = 173,194,150,195) from prior 81.33 (+118.7%), sustained for 4 periods

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods (multiple concluded P\u2192P+4 arrivals). On-hand=0, in-transit=797 which is substantial relative to recent high demand regime (Periods 27-31 avg ~162\u2013178). Recent changepoint: demand jumped starting Period 27 and persisted through Periods 27-31 (Periods 27-31 = 173,194,150,195,156 -> recent elevated regime). I choose L=default to trust the promised lead time (matches observed). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent high-demand regime while smoothing week-to-week noise; N=5 covers Periods 27-31 which show the sustained higher mean. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given large in-transit but elevated demand, while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent volatility for safety stock.

Recent demand regime remains elevated (Periods 27-30 avg=178; Periods 31-32 = 156,148) so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the high mean and volatility. Set L to 'calculate' to lock to observed lead-time average (4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=4 to base (1+L)-period demand on the most recent high-demand regime.

Recent demand has been in a sustained high regime since Period 27 (Periods 27-33 demands = 173,194,150,195,156,148,219), so I forecast using the most recent regime. Set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm continued LT=4. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current high-demand mean and volatility over the last 7 periods, balancing service level against holding cost given high in-transit inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I therefore keep L = promised (4) and set demand estimates using the most recent stable regime (last 4 periods) so the OR backend targets service for current high demand while avoiding overreacting to older data.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; on-hand=223 and in-transit=593 (ample pipeline). Recent demand (Periods 32-35 = 148,219,132,75) shows a new shorter-run regime; to reflect recent demand while keeping service vs holding balance, use promised L and recent-N demand estimates (N=4) so mu_hat and sigma_hat focus on the most recent pattern (multiplied by (1+L) upstream in OR). This keeps orders responsive to the recent decline/variability while recognizing ample pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 32-35: avg decreased from 178.0 to 143.5 (-19.4%) based on Periods 32-35 (148,219,132,75), sustained 4 periods

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has fallen from the late-August/September peak; latest three demands (Periods 34-36) = [132, 75, 69], indicating a lower regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand 265 + in-transit 496 = 761 units, which already covers multiple (1+L) periods of recent demand. To reflect the recent downshift while keeping responsiveness, I set L to default (use promised/confirmed 4) and use recent_N=3 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent regime of 3 periods). This reduces over-ordering relative to older high-demand periods and lowers holding costs while maintaining service given large pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). Current inventory: on-hand=287, in-transit=403 \u2014 ample pipeline (total 690) vs recent demand. I set L using calculate to lock in the observed lead-time evidence. Recent demand appears lower than mid-year peaks; to focus the forecast on the most recent regime I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 4 demand samples (Periods 34-37: 132,75,69,71). This keeps targets responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while the large on-hand+pipeline reduces risk of stockouts. The chosen approach balances service (using observed L) against holding costs by tightening forecast to recent demand.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Recent demand (Periods 36-38 = 69,71,82) averages ~74; current on-hand=426 and in-transit=182 (ample coverage). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4. To keep service high (q=0.8) while reflecting the most recent regime, set L by calculation (confirmed=4), forecast demand using the most recent 3 periods (captures current lower-volatility regime), and estimate sigma from the same recent 3 samples. This keeps base-stock aligned to recent demand and avoids overreacting to older high-variance spikes while the large on-hand position limits immediate stocking urgency.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=541, in-transit=14; pipeline is large relative to recent demand so avoid inflating orders. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods consistently. Recent demand has softened vs prior peak: last 4 concluded demands = [69,71,82,53] (avg \u2248 68.8). To reflect current lower regime while still covering review+lead period, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base_stock and cap from the current short-term mean/volatility. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given profit/holding tradeoff (q=0.8). No explicit adjustments for lost shipments needed \u2013 concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (multiple P\u2192P+4 observations). I set L by calculate to use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to target the current lower regime and limit overstocking given high holding cost; sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to estimate volatility from same recent window. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding excess inventory given on-hand=501 and zero in-transit.

Given very large on-hand and no pipeline, keep promised lead time (default) and use a short recent_N=3 demand window to avoid inflating replenishment by older high-demand regimes. sigma also set recent_N=3 to reflect recent variability. This minimizes ordering while maintaining service for the current lower-demand regime and limits holding cost exposure.

Inventory is high so prioritize accurate short-run forecast rather than inflating targets. Use L='calculate' to reflect observed lead times. Demand has shifted several times historically; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=3 to capture the current short-run demand (Periods 40-42 = 54,46,75) so the backend sets base-stock for the current regime and avoids over-ordering.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-9). On-hand=360, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 37-43 = [71,82,53,54,46,75,20]) shows a sustained lower regime vs prior avg 143.5 (Periods 32-35). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To respond, keep L at promised (default) and estimate demand using recent data to reflect the sustained drop: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 (the recent regime length). This ensures the OR engine targets a lower base-stock appropriate for the new, sustained lower demand while preserving service given no in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 37: avg decreased from 143.5 (Periods 32-35) to 57.57 based on Periods 37-43 = [71,82,53,54,46,75,20] (-59.8%), sustained for 7 periods

To avoid over-ordering given large on-hand and the low recent demand regime, I set L by observed history and base demand forecasts on the most recent 8 periods (the detected low-demand regime length=8). This reduces ordering aggressiveness vs. using all-sample averages and aligns supply with the recent lower demand, while preserving safety by using recent volatility for sigma_hat.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30 (Period 47). On-hand=278, in-transit=157. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 in earlier periods; recent orders (periods 37\u201346) show no unexpected arrivals but that is consistent with L=4 (we will continue to treat promised lead time as valid). Recent demand has been low: last 6 demands (Periods 41\u201346) = [46,75,20,29,26,27], mean \u2248 37.17 and lower than earlier regimes. To avoid excess holding (holding cost = $1 vs profit $4 \u2192 moderate service target), I set L=default to keep using promised lead time, use mu_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect the recent low-demand regime across the review+lead window, and set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to capture recent volatility. This reduces target base stock vs long-run averages and limits additional overstock while maintaining service for current demand levels.
