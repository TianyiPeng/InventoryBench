Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward trend: 2019-01-07=0, 01-14=24, 01-21=29, 01-28=37, 02-04=41. OR recommends 53 using its capped base-stock (it uses L=4 and all history).

Lead-time uncertainty: no concluded arrivals observed yet (no evidence actual lead time differs or of lost shipments), so cannot reduce lead time assumptions. Decision logic: with zero pipeline and an accelerating demand trend (recent 3-week avg ~35.7), I want modestly more cover than OR to avoid stockouts over the 5-period horizon. OR's 53 is reasonable but slightly low given the upward trend; increase to 60 units (\u2248+13%) to provide extra safety stock for sustained demand growth while limiting holding cost exposure.
