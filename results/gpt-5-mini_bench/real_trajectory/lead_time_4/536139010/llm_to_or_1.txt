Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent observed demand sample (Period1)=47; historical weekly samples (47,63,69,60,61) give mean=60 and modest variability. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals => no observed lead-time evidence. Promised lead time=4 remains the best prior. Using default methods: L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=default to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (captures aggregate demand over review+lead), sigma_hat=default to scale volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 relatively high service weight) while avoiding overfitting given no new regime or lead-time signals.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed weekly demand history (five samples) has mean ~60 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=74 (ordered P1) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, which is expected given promised lead time=4. No sustained changepoint or confirmed lead-time deviation (only one outstanding order). Use default promised lead time and default demand statistics to let the OR engine compute base stock for the 1+L review+lead horizon, balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples mean = 60 units. Two prior orders (Period 1:74, Period 2:75) remain unconcluded (arrived=0) though shown in in-transit=149, indicating potential delays or lost shipments but insufficient concluded evidence to infer a lead-time change. I therefore keep L at default (promised 4), and use default demand estimates so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This avoids overreacting to unconfirmed delays while ensuring the OR engine targets the required coverage for review+lead period.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent observed weekly demand samples (historical): [47,63,69,60,61], mean=60. On-hand=0, in-transit=222. Promised lead time=4; no concluded arrivals yet for recent orders (these would not be expected to conclude until later given promised L=4). I therefore keep L at default (use promised lead time). Demand forecast uses default (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to reflect the stable historical weekly mean and the review+lead horizon. Volatility uses default to let backend scale std by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level against holding cost while awaiting concluded arrival signals before changing lead-time or demand-regime estimates.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=295 (matches orders from P1\u2013P4). No concluded arrivals yet \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand mean = 60 (samples: 47,63,69,60,61). Using promised lead time and defaults keeps OR backend using full-sample demand stats ((1+L)\xd7mean) and volatility; this avoids overreacting to in-transit but unconfirmed delays while ensuring coverage for the review+lead period.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluded history confirms an actual lead time of 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5). On-hand=21, in-transit=228 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand history (weekly samples mean=60) should guide stocking. I choose default lead time (use promised L=4) because we have one clear confirmed observation matching the promise and no sustained evidence of loss beyond that. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, producing a base-stock that balances service (protecting against 4-period coverage) versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period5).

Daily Reward (R_t): $69.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Current on-hand 63 + in-transit 204; recent demands (historical samples mean=60) show stable weekly demand. Lead time evidence: Period5 and Period6 conclues show orders placed in Period1 and Period2 arrived after 4 periods \u2192 confirm LT=4. Use 'calculate' so backend computes average observed LT from conclues; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std based on all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). On-hand=93, in-transit=157 \u2192 pipeline total=250 units. Historical weekly demand samples mean=60 (samples:47,63,69,60,61). With promised L=4, (1+L)=5 \u2192 expected demand over review+lead \u2248300 units, so current pipeline is ~50 units short of the 5-period mean demand. No sustained changepoint in demand mean/variance detected (recent weeks around mean=60). I therefore keep L and demand estimates at defaults so the OR backend uses the full sample-based base-stock; this lets the optimizer compute required order to restore service level given profit/holding tradeoff and known lead time evidence.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent weekly demand has been: P4-8 = [60,53,33,43,49] (mean 47.6). On-hand=117, in-transit=122 provides ample coverage vs. expected demand but we must protect against short-term variability. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages; use that. Use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so the forecast reflects the most recent regime (last 5 weeks) rather than older Jan samples. This balances service (capture recent lower mean ~48) vs. holding cost by avoiding inflation from older higher-demand data.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9). On-hand=81, in-transit=134. I use calculated L to reflect observed lead times (average of concluded lead times =4). Demand forecast and uncertainty use defaults so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) while acknowledging the confirmed 4-period lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand samples (weeks in Jan-Feb) have mean=60 units/week; on-hand=90, in-transit=150 (ample pipeline). Lead time has already been confirmed as 4 periods in history, so I will use the promised/default lead time. Use population historical demand (no clear recent regime change) so set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples). This yields a conservative base-stock that balances service (high pipeline + 5-period coverage) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent weekly demand has slowed vs earlier samples: last 5 demands (Periods 7-11) = [43,49,43,42,39], mean=43.2. On-hand=77 + in-transit=163 => pipeline covers multiple weeks but some arrivals are still pending; lead time has consistently observed as 4 periods. I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the most recent lower-demand regime and scale by (1+L). I match sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability and avoid inflating safety stock from older, higher-variance samples. These choices keep target stock aligned with current demand while avoiding excess holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). On-hand=69, in-transit=125. Historical demand samples (weekly) average ~60 (47,63,69,60,61). No sustained demand regime change detected in recent periods (sales per conclude: 53,33,43,49,43,42,39,46 \u2014 variability but no >=3-period shift). I therefore use the promised/default lead time so the OR engine treats L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (protecting 5-week coverage given confirmed L=4) versus holding cost given current healthy pipeline (in-transit 125) and on-hand 69. No overdue/lost shipments currently observed beyond normal lead-time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Historical weekly demand samples (47,63,69,60,61) mean=60. Confirmed lead time=4 (recorded previously). On-hand 30 + in-transit 185 = 215 units vs required coverage (1+L)*mean = 5*60 = 300 units, so pipeline+on-hand currently below target base-stock; use default statistics to let OR compute base_stock = (1+L)*mean + z*\xb7std and capped order. Chosen methods: L=default to use promised (and historically confirmed) 4-period lead time; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (robust given limited data); sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples to reflect demand variability over the review+lead horizon. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods) vs holding cost by relying on the backend's z* cap and cap limiter.

Use promised/default lead time to keep OR engine aligned with observed 4. Set mu_hat to default so backend uses (1+L)*mean = 5*60 (anticipates 5 periods of demand); sigma_hat default to capture historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (cover ~5 periods demand given confirmed L=4 and substantial pipeline) against holding cost given current large in-transit inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand shows a moderate level: last 5 concluded demands = [40,69,55,45,38], mean=49.4. On-hand=30 + in-transit=207 => pipeline=237, broadly aligned with a 1+L horizon forecast. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (confirmed at Period 6 and repeatedly thereafter); use calculated L. To keep the OR engine responsive to the most recent regime while accounting for 4-period lead, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (captures recent variability including the 69 spike). This balances service (capture recent higher demand) vs holding cost by not overreacting to single outliers.

No sustained demand regime shift detected from available historical samples (Jan weekly mean ~60). Using default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility so the OR backend applies its base-stock/cap constraints while honoring observed 4-period arrivals.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent weekly demand has averaged ~43\u201355 with occasional peaks to 69; historical seed samples (Jan\u2013Feb) average ~60. On-hand = 78, in-transit = 158 (ample pipeline). Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods and shipments mostly arrive as promised, though one arrival was zero (possible isolated lost shipment). I choose default L to use the promised lead time (conservative and consistent with observed 4-period arrivals). I choose default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; given healthy pipeline this avoids over-reacting to recent volatility while the cap limits over-ordering. This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost given current inventory cushion.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple observed arrivals at 4 periods). Demand history across periods shows no sustained regime shift requiring a revised forecast. Current on-hand=120 and in-transit=126 provide healthy coverage; using standard base-stock inputs is appropriate. I therefore use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service vs holding cost given no new evidence of change and confirmed lead time.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Current on-hand=129, in-transit=115 (total pipeline=244) which covers multiple weeks given recent lower demand. Historical early-2019 samples show ~60/wk, but the last 5 concluded demands (Periods 17-21 = 38,36,33,20,19) average ~29.2/wk, indicating a sustained downward demand regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in history). I therefore keep L at the promised/default and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the new lower-demand regime (uses the last 5 samples). This keeps target base-stock aligned with current demand and limits excess holding given holding cost >0, while sigma from recent data tightens safety stock to current variability.

Inventory is healthy vs recent weekly demands (~20\u201369 units/week) so use conservative, data-driven defaults: set L by calculating observed lead time average to lock in confirmed L=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples (leveraging full historical seed). This balances service (higher base stock via (1+L) multiplier) against holding cost given current positive on-hand position and steady demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders observed arriving 4 periods after ordering) and stable weekly demand samples from Jan\u2013Feb (mean \u224860). Current inventory: on-hand=128, in-transit=86 \u2192 pipeline=214, which is below (1+L)\xd7mean demand (5\xd760=300) so replenishment needed to restore service. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirms 4). I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, providing a conservative base-stock anchored to historical mean while the backend applies the profit/holding tradeoff and cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=138, in-transit=97. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (confirmed in Period 6). Recent demand in game history is variable but no sustained regime shift detected. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 4), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the calculated L encodes confirmed lead time; given current on-hand + pipeline (~235 units) we are well covered for several periods, so defaults avoid overreacting to short-term noise or risking lost-order corrections.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Current on-hand=129, in-transit=97 (pipeline total 226) and recent demand history shows weekly demand \u224860 (initial samples mean=60). Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4; no new lost-shipment signal. I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand forecast use mu_hat=default i.e. (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples to capture 5-week demand aggregate; sigma_hat=default to reflect historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings give the OR backend a conservative base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost while covering the 5-period demand window.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent observed weekly demand samples (seed data) have mean=60 units; seasonal context (summer) shows no confirmed demand spike. On-hand=104 + in-transit=120 => pipeline=224, which is below the (1+L)*mean demand = 5*60=300, so pipeline likely insufficient; promised lead time is 4 and prior history (Period 6) confirmed actual lead time=4, so use promised/default lead time. I choose default methods so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and variance from full sample set; this keeps forecasts stable given limited sample history while letting the backend cap orders to control order size vs. holding cost. Using defaults balances service level (cover multi-period demand under confirmed L=4) against holding costs by relying on full-sample mean/variance rather than overfitting recent noise.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. Current on-hand=84, in-transit=103 (pipeline=187). Historical sample mean (provided) \u224860 units/week; (1+L)=5 \u2192 default forecast (mu_hat) = 5\xd7mean = 300 demand over review+lead. Pipeline (187) < forecast (300) so replenishment is appropriate. No new sustained changepoints or lost-shipment patterns detected since lead time has been stable at 4. I therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR engine computes base stock and order size given promised L=4 and historical samples.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Current on-hand=72, in-transit=124. Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time=4 (confirmed earlier) and stable weekly demand samples (historic sample mean=60). To keep the OR backend aligned with the promised lead time and full-sample demand estimate, I select default lead time and default demand/mix estimates so mu_hat and sigma_hat use all available samples scaled by (1+L). This balances service (covering L+1 weeks of demand) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Demand history seed (Jan 2019 samples mean=60) and no sustained recent regime shift detected; use default forecasting (backend: (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility to let OR engine compute base-stock while capping order size to limit holding costs given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=23, in-transit=166. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 when arrivals occurred; some intermittent zero-arrival periods but no sustained lead-time shift. To reflect recent weekly demand behavior (more variable and higher than the Jan baseline), I set L to the promised default (keeps model aligned with supplier promise and confirmed observations) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes demand over (1+L) periods using the mean and std of the last 5 concluded weekly demands\u2014this captures the most recent regime and volatility while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=212. Historical weekly mean from provided samples \u224860 units; recent long history shows stable weekly demand. Lead-time evidence (multiple concluded messages) consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods, so use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. I choose L="calculate" to let backend use observed lead times. Demand forecast: use mu_hat="default" ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to rely on full-sample mean given no sustained demand regime change. Volatility: use sigma_hat="default" (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). Note: pipeline (212) is below (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248300, so the backend will likely order to replenish to target; this balances service level (profit>holding cost) while avoiding overstock given current evidence of stable demand and confirmed 4-period lead time.

Current pipeline (191) plus expected arrivals covers multiple future periods; no sustained demand regime change detected. Use L=default to trust promised lead time (matches observed). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively, balancing service level (q from profit/holding) against holding cost without overfitting to short-term noise.

Pipeline (202) will cover future arrivals but current period demand occurs after decision, so keep standard base-stock sizing. I choose L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7sample mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7sample std from the full demand history. This conservative choice leverages full-sample statistics given no confirmed recent sustained demand regime shift and balances service level (via base-stock) against holding cost.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/7 (Period 35). On-hand=0, in-transit=243. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in Period 6). Pipeline (243) covers multiple weeks but on-hand is zero so we must forecast demand for review+lead. I set L to default (use promised 4) because observed lead time equals promise. Demand has shown elevated recent volatility and a sharp rise in late summer (several high-demand weeks), so I use a recent_N forecast to bias mu_hat toward the latest pattern (capture current regime). I choose N=5 to focus on the most recent 5 periods while keeping sample size >=3. I keep sigma_hat as default so the OR engine computes volatility from full history (balanced estimate). These settings aim to supply enough stock for the (1+L) period demand under current high demand while letting the OR backend balance service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:

Demand history samples (seed) have mean ~60/wk; with promised L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods. I choose to let the backend compute lead time from observations (calculate) and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR engine builds base-stock from the full-sample mean and std ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps service level tuned to observed stable weekly demand while relying on in-transit stock to cover near-term demand and avoids overreacting to short-term noise. No evidence of lost shipments beyond earlier confirmed 4-period arrivals.

I therefore use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given ample in-transit stock and no new signal of changed demand or lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=215. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 periods (recorded in carry-over). Recent demand (Periods 31\u201337) shows a sustained higher regime (many weeks of 60\u201371+ and occasional spikes to 113). To capture the current elevated mean and volatility while respecting confirmed lead time, use L=default (promised 4). Use recent_N with N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the most recent 7 demand observations (captures the recent regime length). This balances service-level (higher \u03bc\u0302 to avoid stockouts with long lead) against holding cost by limiting the sample window to recent behavior rather than all-time average.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=7, in-transit=249 (large pipeline arriving per confirmed LT=4). Historical sample set (Jan\u2013Feb) is the baseline; recent concluded periods show demand volatility but pipeline currently covers (1+L) periods. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4; therefore use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend calculates base-stock from full-sample mean/std. This avoids overfitting to recent spikes while the large in-transit stock mitigates immediate stockout risk and limits holding cost exposure.

On-hand=76, in-transit=172 (pipeline=248) \u2014 ample coverage vs. expected (L+1) demand. I choose default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L); this balances service level with current high pipeline and avoids overreacting to recent noise or isolated delayed arrivals.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=16, in-transit=206. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 (confirmed in Period 6 and repeatedly thereafter). Pipeline (206) plus on-hand covers multiple future periods, but recent Period 40 conclude showed arrived=0 for the order placed in Period 36\u2014no sustained multi-period loss pattern yet. Use observed lead-time data to set L (calculate average observed lead times). Demand statistics supplied will be used by defaults so mu_hat and sigma_hat scale (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std respectively, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (backend will compute z*). This keeps parameters conservative given confirmed LT=4 and healthy pipeline.

Promised lead time is 4 and historical observed arrivals consistently show LT=4; use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this anchors forecasts to full history while the pipeline shortfall vs. (1+L)\xd7mean (231 vs. 5\xd760=300) signals the optimizer to order.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows consistently observed lead_time = 4 periods (many concluded arrivals at W=4) and a large demand spike in Period 42 (demand=175) that exhausted on-hand stock. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=173 (pipeline will arrive per past orders). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed average lead time from concluded messages (matches promised 4). For demand parameters I use 'default' mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples \u2014 this balances using long-run sample stats while the backend's capped ordering will limit excessive orders given holding cost. This approach is robust to the recent spike (keeps parameters data-driven) while relying on the confirmed lead-time estimate.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=241. Historical demand samples (seed) mean ~60/week (47,63,69,60,61). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history. Pipeline (241) currently provides substantial cover. To let the OR engine use full historical statistics and the confirmed promised lead time, I select default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use full-sample mean) against holding cost given large in-transit inventory and confirmed LT=4.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=289. Recent demand shows a clear spike starting Period 42 (175,132,131) likely holiday season; prior recent average (~Periods 32\u201341) \u224866.5. I keep L as promised (default) because concluded history consistently shows 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 42\u201344 avg=146) so the base-stock target reflects the holiday spike. Sigma also uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect elevated volatility in the same recent window. These choices push the OR backend to raise target stock for the holiday surge while using observed lead time; note in-transit 289 is likely insufficient for (1+L)*recent demand, so the OR policy will need larger orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 42: recent avg (P42\u2013P44)=146 vs prior avg (P32\u2013P41)\u224866.5 (+~120%).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent demand has stepped up: Periods 42\u201344 avg \u2248146 (spike vs prior \u224866). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=416 which covers future demand given elevated regime but arrival confirmations show consistent 4-period lead time historically. I retain promised lead time to align with supplier promise. For demand I use a recent_N estimate focused on the confirmed high-demand regime (use last 3 periods P42\u2013P44 where avg\u2248146) so the OR engine sizes base-stock to meet the new higher demand quickly. I use recent_N for sigma as well to reflect volatility in the new regime. This balances higher service level (reduce stockouts during the spike) against holding cost by limiting the recency window to the confirmed regime.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=534 (large pipeline arriving per lead time). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time; use promised/default L. Recent demand regime shift at Period 42 (P42\u2013P44 avg\u2248146 vs prior\u224866) persists through P46; to capture elevated demand I set mu_hat to recent_N using the most recent 5 periods (P42\u2013P46). Volatility also elevated in that window so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5. These choices bias the base-stock upward to protect service during the sustained high-demand period while sigma_hat captures higher uncertainty to avoid excessive overstock given holding cost.
