Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (weekly data). SKU is ladies denim jeggings; historical weekly demand samples show mean ~129.6 over five recent weeks. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time is 4 periods; no evidence of lead-time shifts or demand regime change (only 5 samples, no sustained trend). Use default lead time to rely on promised L=4 and default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level using available history while avoiding overfitting to short recent fluctuations.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=161 (order placed in P1). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred; promised lead time (4) remains the best default. Recent demand showed a single high week (186) but not yet a sustained shift (need >=3 periods). Use default calculations so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for volatility, balancing service level from promised L against holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=347 (161+186 placed prior) and no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on historical samples (mean ~129.6 over five weeks). No evidence of a sustained demand shift or lead-time change, so use backend defaults to let OR balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=528. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean ~129.6. Promised lead time is 4 periods and we have no concluded arrivals yet (orders placed in Periods 1\u20133 would only conclude at/after Period 5), so no evidence of lost or shortened shipments. Use default lead time to keep model aligned with promise. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (which apply (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean and sqrt(1+L) scaling to full-sample std) so the OR engine computes a base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost. The in-transit 528 units will be compared to the backend's pipeline estimate; defaults preserve historical demand signal while avoiding overreaction to currently unconfirmed arrival delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-4) shows a downward shift vs. older weekly samples: P1=186, P2=134, P3=111, P4=94 (mean last 4 = 131.25). On-hand=0, in-transit=706. Four consecutive conclude messages show zero arrivals for prior orders, implying actual lead time > promised 4 or lost shipments; pipeline of 706 may be insufficient if lead time is longer. To protect service given missing arrivals, I set L explicitly longer than promised to reflect delayed/lost deliveries, and base demand estimates on the most recent 4 periods to capture the downward shift. Sigma uses recent 4 periods to reflect current volatility. These choices make the OR engine target (1+L)\xd7recent mean demand and increase safety by expanding lead-time assumption, balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1) by not using long historical higher means.

Carry-over insight: No arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1-4 (4 consecutive periods); indicates possible lost shipments or actual lead time > promised 4 periods (sustained evidence).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history shows Period 5 arrival: Period1 order arrived with lead_time=4 (one observed instance). On-hand=79, in-transit=743; pipeline likely includes orders from Periods 2-5 still in transit under a 4-period lead. Demand sample mean from provided historical weeks ~129.6/wk. Given the single confirmed lead-time observation, use calculated average lead time to let backend formalize; use default demand/variance aggregation so backend applies (1+L) scaling to full-sample mean/std. This balances service (profit/holding ratio favors service) while avoiding manual over-adjustment for currently unconfirmed multi-period lead-time shifts or demand regime changes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $220.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): Recent conclude messages confirm orders from Periods 1 and 2 arrived with lead_time=4. On-hand=168, in-transit=557 (total pipeline 725) which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of expected demand using sample history. Profit=4, holding=1 => target service quantile high; given confirmed lead time and no evidence of demand regime shift, use default calculations so OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This preserves backend familiarity with historical variance while avoiding overfitting to short fluctuations and accounts for the confirmed 4-period lead time when sizing base stock.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order P1 arrived in P5; order P2 arrived in P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history shows three observed arrivals with lead_time=4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7) so actual lead time aligns with promised 4. On-hand=91 + in-transit=376 gives ample pipeline cover vs typical weekly demand samples. I select L via calculate to lock in the observed lead time (average observed = 4). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from the full sample history\u2014this balances service level driven by profit/holding (profit=$4, holding=$1) while avoiding overreacting to a single high-demand week (Period 7 demand=258). These choices ensure the base-stock policy accounts for the confirmed 4-period lead time and leverages full-sample demand statistics to temper volatility.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/08 (Period 9). Product is seasonal apparel; recent weekly demand samples average 129.6 units (samples: 126,120,128,113,161). On-hand=95 + in-transit=412 = 507 units in pipeline, which comfortably covers multiple weeks. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (backend will confirm average\u22484). For demand forecast I use the default (all-samples) method so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) (\u22485*129.6=648) which matches the observed sample mean and encapsulates review+lead demand. Volatility will use default so sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This keeps the OR engine anchored to confirmed lead time and historical demand while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise; with on-hand+pipeline already high, the backend cap will prevent excessive ordering.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=189, in-transit=430. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = promised 4 periods. Demand history (five weekly samples) mean = 129.6/wk; using default methods lets the OR engine compute base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set so it leverages all observed variability. With profit=$4 and holding=$1, the backend will calculate an appropriate service quantile; keeping L, mu_hat, sigma_hat as default ensures conservative replenishment using full-history estimates while accounting for the confirmed 4-period lead time and current healthy pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/22 (Period 11). On-hand=100, in-transit=573; profit/holding => high fill target (q=0.8). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9). Therefore use calculated average lead time to reflect observed behavior, and default demand/volatility aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) so the OR backend uses full historical demand to set base stock; this leverages large pipeline to maintain service while avoiding unnecessary explicit adjustments given ample in-transit inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has been elevated and variable (Mar\u2013Apr weeks: 82,97,258,174,104,89,119,111). On-hand=103 + in-transit=526 => pipeline=629 units, which covers multiple weeks given recent weekly demand (~130\u2013160). Prior concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; promised lead time is 4. To be responsive to recent demand regime (higher/variable since March), use a recent-window forecast for mean and volatility so base stock reflects the newer regime while keeping L at promised (default). This balances service (capture higher demand) vs holding cost by not inflating lead time. No evidence of new sustained lost shipments beyond previously recorded confirmation.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=204, in-transit=340. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier). Demand has varied but no sustained recent regime shift requiring reactive weighting. To be conservative and align with observed lead time, set L by calculating average observed lead times; use default demand/statistics aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples. This balances service level (use observed L) and holding cost (no explicit increase to mu or sigma).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P8\u2192P12, P9\u2192P13, P10\u2192P14). Current on-hand=203, in-transit=379 \u2014 pipeline ample vs recent weekly demand (~100\u2013260 range, recent weeks ~111\u2013144). No sustained demand regime shift detected. Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies full-sample mean/variance across the (1+L) review+lead horizon; this balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 moderate target fill rate) while avoiding overfitting to recent variability or transient missed arrivals.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Profit per unit $4 vs holding $1 implies target service level q=0.8 (high fill-rate). Given consistent evidence for LT=4 and no new demand regime change, use calculated lead time (average of observed lead times) and default demand/volatility priors ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine computes base_stock with a high service quantile while respecting historical demand variability. This balances the high profit-driven service level against holding cost and accounts for pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $418.00

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Recent concluded history consistently shows observed lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). On-hand = 110, in-transit = 483 (total pipeline 593) which comfortably covers several review+lead periods of typical demand (~100-160/wk). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. I leave mu_hat and sigma_hat as default (use all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend computes a base-stock appropriate to the long-run sample stats; given large pipeline this avoids over-ordering while preserving service. This balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost by relying on historical demand stats and confirmed lead time.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=74, in-transit=584 (large pipeline). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.); therefore use promised/default lead time. Demand history (seed samples and subsequent weekly demands) shows no new sustained demand regime requiring manual override; using default demand/volatility estimators lets the OR backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This keeps base-stock sizing aligned with long-run demand while the large in-transit stock limits urgent ordering, reducing risk of excess holding cost.

Demand historical samples (Jan\u2013Feb 2019) have mean ~129.6/week. Given confirmed lead time and no sustained recent demand regime shift, use the backend defaults: promised lead time (4) and default demand/volatility scaling so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std.

Using historical weekly mean (~129.6) and L=4, (1+L)=5 \u2192 target demand coverage \u2248648 units, so pipeline slightly below target and backend should replenish.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=502, in-transit=106; profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5,P2\u2192P6,...). Inventory is ample vs recent weekly demand (historical weekly demands mostly <150). To keep OR backend aligned with observed behavior and promised lead time, use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise and leverages confirmed LT=4.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods and no evidence of lost shipments; on-hand=475 and in-transit=114 provide strong coverage. Demand has been relatively stable in recent periods (weekly demands mostly 29\u2013144, current on-hand high). I will use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples, letting the optimizer compute the base-stock and capped order quantity while avoiding manual over-adjustment given sufficient on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). On-hand=445, in-transit=126 \u2014 ample coverage vs. historical weekly demand (mean \u2248129.6). Profit=$4, holding=$1 implies moderate service-level target; given stable demand history and confirmed LT=4, use defaults so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance with promised lead time.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has been moderate and stable; current on-hand=399, in-transit=141 (total pipeline=540) which comfortably covers expected near-term demand. Historical sample mean (seed data) ~129.6/week; promised lead time=4 and past concluded messages consistently show 4-period arrivals. No evidence of new demand regime or lost shipments. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to full-sample mean and std, letting the optimizer balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Pipeline + on-hand comfortably exceed near-term demand, so use observed lead time average and default demand stats to let OR backend compute base-stock balancing profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1). Choosing 'calculate' for L (average observed lead times = 4) and default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend apply (1+L) scaling to the full-sample mean/std while respecting its caps.

I select L=default (use promised 4). Demand & volatility set to default so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), providing a neutral base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1. Current on-hand + pipeline (472 total) is ample versus typical weekly demand; defaults avoid overreacting to short-term noise and handle replenishment through capped ordering.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-16 (Period 32). Recent concludes show consistent observed lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->arrival pairs). On-hand=130, in-transit=372 provides ample pipeline cover. Demand samples (seeded historical weekly mean \u2248129.6) are consistent with current weekly sales (~100\u2013130). To keep the OR engine aligned with observed lead time and stable demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps service level targeting tied to profit/holding tradeoff while not overfitting short-term noise or risking lost-shipment adjustments.

Use default demand estimates (no recent sustained demand regime change detected from available samples), letting OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (profit/holding ratio) while preventing excessive new orders given large in-transit quantity.

Recent demand shows a higher, more volatile regime (notably Periods 31-35: 102,125,266,143,125); I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current demand level and volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while balancing holding cost.

Current on-hand=27, in-transit=669 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand (~696) comfortably covers a (1+L)-period demand forecast. Profit=$4, holding=$1 implies moderate service-level target; using demand and lead-time estimates rather than short-window adjustments avoids overreacting to recent variability. Set L by calculation to reflect observed lead times; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and volatility over all samples (stable long history available). This keeps ordering conservative given large in-transit inventory and confirmed lead time.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent history shows consistent observed lead times of 4 periods (many concluded arrivals: orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, ..., P33\u2192P37). On-hand=0, in-transit=542 which covers multiple future periods given typical weekly demand; no evidence of new lead-time elongation or lost shipments. Use lead-time estimate inferred from observations (calculate) to reflect observed reality rather than blind promised value. Use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) with holding cost given ample pipeline. These settings keep orders conservative while avoiding over-reacting to short-term spikes.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=479. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained evidence). Recent demand since Period 33 (large spikes including 266, 233, 234) appears higher than earlier baseline; to capture the recent regime I use a recent window. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms 4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the most recent 20 demand samples, which balances higher recent demand while reflecting current volatility and the (L+1) review horizon. This approach anticipates the elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to a single outlier and leverages pipeline visibility (479 units) to avoid excessive ordering.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: average demand in Periods 33-38 = 180 units vs earlier baseline ~120 units (+~50 units, ~42% increase); Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple concluded orders P1->P5, P2->P6, etc).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 33 (periods 33-38 avg \u2248180 vs prior \u2248120) and multiple concluded orders confirming lead time = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=537. I set L by calculating observed lead times (matches promised 4). For demand I use recent_N over the new high-demand regime to capture elevated mean (regime length = 7 periods -> N=7). I also set sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock up to meet higher demand while using observed lead-time to avoid over/under-estimating pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 33 (Periods 33-38 avg ~180 vs prior ~120). On-hand=133, in-transit=566 (adequate pipeline). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods\u2014use promised/default L=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 33-38). Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias base-stock upward to meet elevated demand while pipeline inventory reduces need for immediate extra ordering and controls holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has risen vs earlier baseline: Periods 33-41 demand avg = 161.9 (n=9) vs ~120 earlier (~34% increase). On-hand=30, in-transit=773 (large pipeline). Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed at 4 periods in concluded history. I set L=default to use promised (4) which matches observed confirmations. For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 9 periods: P33-P41). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the higher post-changepoint demand while sigma from recent periods keeps safety stock aligned to current variability; leaving L=default leverages confirmed lead time so OR backend orders appropriately against the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-2). On-hand=0, in-transit=786. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 confirmations) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 33 (~+42% vs earlier). I set L='calculate' to use observed lead-time evidence (avg observed \u22484). For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the post-Period-33 high-demand regime (use last 10 samples to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean). Sigma also uses recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock toward the higher recent demand while respecting confirmed lead time and current pipeline to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 33 (higher mean ~180 vs previous ~120). On-hand=76, in-transit=925. Promised lead time remains consistent with observed conclusions (4 periods); use promised lead time to keep OR engine aligned. To capture the higher recent demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 33-43, N=11). This increases target base-stock to meet service level (profit/holding => high fill priority) while sigma_hat recent_N captures elevated volatility from large spikes. Parameters ensure pipeline + on-hand cover ~5 review+lead periods of recent demand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 33 (higher weekly demand ~180 vs prior ~120). Current inventory: on-hand=257, in-transit=676 (pipeline covers multiple periods at elevated demand). Promised lead time is 4 periods; concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I set L to default (promised=4) and estimate demand using the recent regime samples: mu_hat recent_N with N=12 (Periods 33-44) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 12 weeks. Volatility also uses recent_N N=12 so safety stock matches current higher variability. These choices prioritize service (reduce lost sales during the confirmed higher-demand regime) while letting the OR engine compute the exact base stock and caps using profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 33 (avg ~180 vs prior ~120). On-hand=259, in-transit=545 (ample pipeline). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods; no recent evidence of lost shipments. I keep L as default (promised 4). To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand forecasts, using the most recent 6 weeks covering the post-changepoint period (Periods 33-38) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat; this raises the base-stock to protect service during high demand while sigma_hat recent_N ensures safety stock matches observed volatility. This balances profitable sales (profit $4) against holding cost ($1) by targeting a higher service level only because the demand shift is sustained and pipeline is healthy.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; use backend's calculated average to confirm. To reflect the post-Period-33 higher demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent samples from the new regime (Periods 33-46). This biases the base-stock toward the higher demand while sigma from the same window captures increased variability, helping the OR engine raise service level during the sustained higher-demand regime without overcommitting further out of regime.
