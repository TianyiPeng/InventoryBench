Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. History shows recent uptick (last sample 113) but only one high observation so not yet a sustained regime change. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer lead time. Use promised lead time (default) to avoid misestimating L. Use recent_N for mu_hat with N=3 to weight the last 3 weeks (captures upward movement without overreacting to a single week). Use default sigma_hat to leverage full-sample volatility until a sustained change is confirmed. This balances service level (capture recent demand rise) against holding cost conservatively.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand samples (36,54,62,60,113) give mean=65 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=126 from Period 1 order which has not yet concluded (arrived=0) \u2014 too early to infer lead-time change. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates: keep L as promised (default) so backend uses lead_time=4; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std of all samples are applied. This balances service (captures recent higher sample 113) vs. holding cost without overreacting to a single missed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demands: [36,54,62,60,113] (mean=65). On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (orders from P1+P2) with no concluded arrivals yet \u2014 cannot confirm actual lead time. Use promised lead time and population-based demand estimates: L default to promised (no concluded evidence to alter); mu_hat default to leverage full-sample mean across (1+L) periods; sigma_hat default to full-sample std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This keeps the OR backend aligned with historical demand while avoiding premature adjustments for possible delayed/lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). Recent concluded history shows three orders (P1-P3) with zero arrivals so far; on-hand=0, in-transit=453. No concluded arrivals exist to infer an actual lead time different from the promised 4, and demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) have mean ~65 units/week. Given profit=holding cost, target service quantile = 0.5, so use the backend defaults which incorporate all historical demand. Using default L preserves promised lead time (avoid overreacting to unconfirmed delays); default mu_hat uses (1+L)*mean of all samples to cover review+lead demand; default sigma_hat uses sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples to set safety stock. This balances service (covering the 5-period demand window) against holding cost while we wait for concluded arrivals to confirm lead-time issues.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent observed weekly demand (Periods 1-4) is much higher than the older sample mean: recent mean = 138.5 vs historical mean = 65. On-hand=0, in-transit=485 (orders placed in P1-P4) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet (expected arrivals will only be visible after their arrival period conclude). I treat lead time as default (use promised 4) because conclude messages for arrivals that would confirm a different lead time are not yet available. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 demand observations to capture the clear upward regime (N=4) so the OR backend will raise the base-stock to cover the higher demand. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given the higher recent demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than the older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed: historical sample mean=65 (2019-01 data) vs recent Periods 1-4 mean=138.5 (+113%), sustained for 4 periods (Periods 1-4).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=54, in-transit=544. Recent history shows one concluded arrival indicating actual lead time=4 (Period1\u2192Period5). Demand regime shifted up: Periods1-4 mean=138.5 (sustained 4 periods). To cover review+lead demand under the new regime, set L by calculating observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 4 demand samples to capture the new mean/volatility. This keeps service high while limiting excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent history shows a demand regime shift earlier (Periods 1-4 high demand) and cooler demand since Period 5 (period demands: P4=104, P5=72, P6=119). On-hand=84, in-transit=395 \u2014 pipeline is large and likely covers multiple review+lead periods. Two observed arrivals indicate actual lead times of 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6); I choose to let backend compute average observed lead time. To respect the recent downward shift after Period 4 while still smoothing noise, I use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast emphasizes latest demand samples and variance. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the recent lower-demand regime while the large pipeline prevents aggressive ordering, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Observed concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). On-hand=94, in-transit=230 (pipeline healthy). Demand recent samples (Periods 3-7 = 131,104,72,119,168) show a higher regime than historical Jan samples; I use a recent_N forecast to capture current elevated/volatile demand while keeping base-stock responsive. Set L by calculation (use observed lead times). Use mu_hat recent_N N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent 5 demand observations. Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility for safety stock.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent demand regime is higher: last 4 period demands (P1-P4) avg=138.5/week vs historical sample mean=65\u2014sustained per carry-over. Observed concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1-P4 all arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=375 which is well below (1+L)*recent mean so we must plan to replenish to cover the higher regime. Choose L by calculating average observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect the new, sustained higher-demand regime (N=4 chosen as regime length=4, within [3,20]). This balances service (use recent higher mean) vs holding cost by letting OR backend compute base stock from these updated demand moments.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Current on-hand=94, in-transit=383. Historical concludes show orders placed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9: consistent observed lead time = 4 periods. Demand has shifted up recently (recent demands: P5-P9 = [72,119,168,142,91], elevated vs older samples), so I use a recent-sample forecast to capture the new regime while keeping safety from sigma. L set to calculated observed lead time to match reality; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=5 to reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and its volatility, which helps the OR backend set a higher base-stock to avoid stockouts but still constrain ordering via the cap given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent demand regime elevated: Periods 1-4 show sustained higher demand (avg 138.5) vs historical sample mean 65 (+113%). Observed concluded arrivals show consistent lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). On-hand=25, in-transit=498 \u2014 pipeline is large but lead time confirmation means future arrivals are expected on schedule. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to reflect the new high-demand regime (use recent 4 periods to compute (1+L)*mean). For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=4) to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while the OR backend's cap will limit excessive single-period ordering given the large pipeline.

Demand recently elevated vs historical (recent windows show higher mean); to capture current regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility with N=8 (last 8 demand samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent demand over the (1+L) review+lead horizon and balance service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding ($1/$1).

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=117, in-transit=373. Observed concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead times (multiple P->P+4 arrivals), so use computed lead time. Recent demand has dropped vs earlier surge: last 4 concluded demands (P9-12 = 91,69,72,60) average ~73; this appears a new lower regime vs prior high mean (~138.5). I therefore set L via calculate (use observed lead times). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new lower regime for mu_hat and matching recent volatility for sigma_hat. These parameters steer the OR backend to lower base-stock than the earlier surge, reducing excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 9: recent avg (Periods 9-12)=73 vs prior recent mean=138.5 (Periods 1-4) => -47%, sustained 4 periods (P9-12).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=267, in-transit=180 \u2014 ample coverage vs one-period demand but watch future depletion. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (orders in P1-P9 concluded with W=4), so use calculated lead time. To respond to the confirmed downward regime (sustained ~4 periods), I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 4 samples (captures current lower mean and volatility) so the OR backend will size the (1+L)-period forecast to current demand and avoid excess holding given high holding cost = profit. This balances service (cover L+1 periods) against holding cost given large on-hand and pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-292.00

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 11-14 demands = 72,60,43,45; recent mean = 55). On-hand=337 + in-transit=65 => pipeline_inventory=402, which comfortably covers multiple (1+L) periods of demand. Observed concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time (multiple orders: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13, P10->P14). I therefore set L via calculate (use observed lead times). Demand forecast uses the most recent regime (recent_N, N=4) to capture the lower recent demand rather than older higher values; sigma likewise uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent variability. This keeps target base-stock low to avoid excess holding costs given ample on-hand inventory and $1 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: orders placed on Periods 1-4,5,7-10 arrived on Periods 5-8,9,11-14 respectively; observed lead_time=4 for multiple samples).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been lower vs early history (recent periods 12-15 demands = 60,43,45,70; recent mean ~54.5) and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To avoid additional holding cost given high on-hand, I use the promised lead time (default) and base demand forecasts on the most recent regime (last 4 periods) so the OR engine reduces replenishment compared with long-run averages. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=4 to reflect the recent lower-mean, lower-volatility regime and limit new orders while inventory is ample.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=217, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple samples P5-P15). Recent demand has been lower than the early spike; last 4 concluded demands (Periods 13-16) = [43,45,70,115], recent mean ~68.25. To align ordering with the current lower regime while accounting for 1+L review horizon, set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean on the most recent stable regime. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to reflect recent demand volatility. This reduces excess holding given large on-hand and zero in-transit, while maintaining service against observed demand levels.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals at 4). On-hand=69, in-transit=124 => pipeline+on-hand =193, which covers several future periods given recent demand (~65 historical mean but recent variability). I choose L by 'calculate' to use observed lead-time samples (reflecting confirmed 4). I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this is conservative given the historical sample mean (65) and avoids overfitting short recent fluctuations while the pipeline is healthy. This balances service level (maintain coverage for lead time+current period) against holding cost given profit=holding=$1.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). Recent demand has moved through several regimes; most recent 5-period demand (P17-21) averages ~106 units/week, while historical earlier means were higher. On-hand=0, in-transit=394 \u2014 with promised lead time 4 this pipeline currently provides material but may not cover a higher target base-stock if demand rebounds. Lead time has multiple concluded samples =4, so use observed lead time history. To be responsive to the most recent regime I set demand estimates using the last 5 periods (captures recent rebound and volatility) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat; L set to be calculated from observed lead times so backend uses confirmed lead-time evidence. This balances service (use recent demand to avoid understock) against holding cost (not using long-historical high mean that would overstock given current pipeline).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has settled higher than early 2019: last 4 concluded demands = {P20:82, P21:131, P22:145, P23:123}, mean \u2248120.25. On-hand=62, in-transit=346 \u2192 pipeline + on-hand = 408, so supply is ample vs near-term demand; no obvious lost shipments (multiple prior arrivals confirm lead_time=4). I set L to default (promised = 4, consistent with observed arrivals). I use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to capture the current, sustained higher-demand regime (uses (1+L)*mean of last 4 samples). I use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to the current regime while the large pipeline limits aggressive ordering and reduces holding cost risk.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand recent sequence (Periods 17-24) is volatile but centered near ~110; no new sustained regime shift detected. I set L=calculate to lock in the empirically observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the most recent regime (Periods 17-24) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend scales base-stock to current demand while respecting the long in-transit pipeline and avoiding excess overstock given holding cost = profit.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=0, in-transit=489. Historical conclues consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders). Recent observed demand (Periods 22-25) = [145,123,70,88], suggesting a moderate decline vs earlier peaks. To make the base-stock responsive to the recent regime while respecting confirmed lead time and the large pipeline, set L=default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 4 demand observations; this helps the OR backend reduce overstocking from older high peaks while retaining service over the 5-period coverage required.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=20, in-transit=393, promised L=4 and historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=4. Recent demand has been higher and more variable than the early historical Jan samples; last 10 demand observations (Periods 17-26) show elevated mean vs the older regime. Pipeline is large so we don't need extra safety from increasing L; use observed lead time average. Set L by calculate (use observed lead times). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current higher-demand regime (covers roughly Periods 17-26). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters balance service (large pipeline + recent mean) against holding cost by relying on recent demand stats rather than older low-demand samples.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (last ~8 periods) is materially higher and more variable than the early 2019 sample mean; I therefore keep L as promised (default) and use recent_N=8 for demand mean and volatility to capture the current regime (balances service vs holding given profit=holding cost). Recent_N=8 captures the most current demand pattern without overfitting to a single spike.

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=107, in-transit=304. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly show lead_time=4 (multiple samples P5..P28). Recent demand has risen vs Jan samples; last 5 realized demands (Periods 24-28) average ~99.6, so I use a recent-N demand estimate to capture the current higher regime. Set L by calculating the average of observed lead times (confirmed 4). Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility, balancing service (higher recent demand) against holding cost given current substantial pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Current on-hand=65, in-transit=349. Historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods. To respect the proven LT and focus forecasts on the recent demand regime (last several weeks showing lower, more variable demand vs early spikes) I set L to default (promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent 8 demand observations (reduces influence of early high outliers and reflects current seasonality). I also use recent_N N=8 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock responsive to current demand while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding, so we prioritize tighter inventory).

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods.

Current inventory: on-hand=79, in-transit=330 (pipeline ample). No evidence of lost shipments. I use default/promised lead time and default demand estimators so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this keeps the policy anchored to long-run demand while the large pipeline covers short-term demand and avoids aggressive reorders that increase holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Recent demand (Periods 27-34) averages lower (~77 units/week) than early spike regimes; no new sustained changepoint detected. To keep the policy responsive to current run-rate while respecting confirmed LT=4, I set L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat based on recent demand (recent_N) to reflect current lower mean, and sigma_hat based on recent demand volatility (recent_N) to capture recent variability. This reduces overstock risk versus using long-run high mean while preserving service given substantial pipeline.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=123, in-transit=257. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4); no new lost-shipment signal. Recent realized weekly demand has settled lower than early spikes (recent weeks ~54\u201387, recent mean ~71\u201380). To be responsive to the recent regime while still smoothing noise, I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock covers (1+L) periods using recent demand; L=default (promised) since observed lead time=4 matches promise. This balances service level (use recent demand) against holding cost by avoiding inflation from older high-demand outliers.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent weekly sales have been subdued vs early-year spikes; last 8 concluded sold values \u2248 [79,92,92,143,54,61,67,61] showing a recent lower-demand regime (~\u224878 weekly mean including a peak). On-hand=138, in-transit=208 (pipeline covers multiple weeks given confirmed 4-period lead time). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time to align with backend. To capture the recent demand regime and avoid overstock, use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 8 samples to reflect the latest mean/volatility. This reduces target base-stock versus using all-sample mean and balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Recent demand has settled lower than earlier spikes: last 8 concluded period demands (Periods 30-37) ~79,78,78,87,67,54,61,70 => recent mean ~72; recent variability is lower than early regime. Use recent_N=8 to anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the current lower, stable regime so orders match demand and avoid excess holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent demand has been lower and more variable than the early 2019 samples; current inventory (on-hand 172 + in-transit 246 = 418) is ample. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so use promised/default. To avoid over-ordering given high pipeline and recent lower demand regime, use recent_N for demand estimates (N=8 captures the latest two months of weekly observations without overfitting). Using recent_N for sigma matches the mu window so service-level sizing reflects recent volatility. These settings bias the OR engine toward lower replenishment while maintaining service given confirmed L=4.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods; recent demand shows no new sustained regime change since prior insights. Inventory is healthy (pipeline + on-hand covers multiple weeks), so use promised/confirmed lead time and population-wide demand stats to avoid overfitting short-term noise. Choosing default L ensures consistency with observed LT=4; default mu_hat and sigma_hat let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level against holding cost given current ample inventory.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple confirmed samples across history) and no new sustained demand regime shift in recent periods. Pipeline + on-hand currently provides coverage; to keep the OR backend aligned with promised/observed behavior I use the default lead time and default demand estimates so the engine applies its population statistics over the full history.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent demand has settled well below early-year spikes; last 8 periods show a lower-demand regime. On-hand=158, in-transit=222 (pipeline ample vs expected demand). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods historically, so use observed-average. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding \u2192 critical fractile=0.5), I focus demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last N=8 periods to reflect current variability and lower mean; set L by calculated average of observed lead times (will be 4). This yields a base_stock tied to recent demand and a tighter cap via backend, limiting new orders given large pipeline and high holding cost.

Date 2019-12-09. Recent demand has been steady and low (Periods 36-43 demands: 61,70,36,41,31,33,60,40) after earlier regime shifts; on-hand=254 and in-transit=86 provide ample coverage. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default L to keep backend alignment. Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=8) to focus the forecast on the current low-demand regime (8 most recent demand observations) so base-stock reflects recent demand and avoids excessive holding given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=243, in-transit=147. Historical 2019-01 mean demand ~65, but recent weeks (Periods 43-46) show much lower demand: [40,32,35,30], recent mean\u224834 \u2014 a sustained low-demand regime for 4 periods. Lead time evidence from concluded messages consistently equals 4 periods across many samples. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4). For demand I use a recent_N forecast (N=4) to capture the current low-demand regime and avoid overstock. For volatility I use recent_N (N=4) so safety stock reflects recent low variance. These choices bias the base-stock down vs long-run historical averages, reducing holding cost while preserving service for current demand; using calculated L ensures pipeline sizing matches observed 4-period lead time and avoids under-ordering due to delayed assumptions.
