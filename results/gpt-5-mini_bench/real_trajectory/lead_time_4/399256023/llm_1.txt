There is one large observation (113) which could be noise or start of an upswing but not yet 3+ consistent periods. c) Lead time / orders: Promised lead time = 4 periods. No prior orders placed, arrivals = 0 historically, so no confirmed actual lead time and no signs of lost shipments. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=0. To cover demand occurring this period plus the L future periods, plan must cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand. e) Final order logic: Use conservative forecast = 5-week demand = 5 * 65 = 325 units.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end); no product-specific seasonal spike expected for ladies denim\u2014demand has been low. Demand analysis: recent realized weekly demand P43\u2013P46 = {40,32,35,30}, avg \u2248 34. For lead time: confirmed 4 periods (historical concludes). Pipeline assessment: on-hand 2 + in-transit 196 = 198 units available to cover future demand. Ordering policy: must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand after decision => 5*34 \u2248 170 units required. Current pipeline (198) already exceeds this target and ordering would increase holding cost ($1/unit/period) without raising profit. Therefore place no order this period to avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service level.",
