  "rationale": "Lead time inference: concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals from orders placed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Inventory & demand: on-hand = 165, in-transit = 0. Recent demand (Periods 41\u201346 = 32,27,12,12,20,16) average \u2248 19.8 units/week; five-period demand over review+lead (L+1=5) \u2248 99 units. OR recommended 141 units based on older/higher demand estimates and promised assumptions; ordering that would create excess holding given Profit=Holding ($1) so overstocks are costly. Decision: place zero order. Rationale: on-hand 165 already comfortably covers the 5-period demand forecast (~99) with buffer; actual lead time is 4 so new order would arrive after 4 periods and only increase holding cost without improving service materially given current low demand. Monitor next concluded periods for any sustained demand increase before ordering.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Override OR: order 0 units because actual lead time = 4 and current on-hand (165) already exceeds expected 5-period demand (~99); recent demand has dropped (~20/week), so avoid extra holding cost.",
