Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward trend (samples: 2019-01-07:6, 01-14:13, 01-21:32, 01-28:49, 02-04:62). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Promised lead time is 4 periods; no concluded arrivals to contradict it. To be conservative and let the OR engine incorporate the full history (including trend) into base-stock and safety stock calculations, use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This balances higher recent demand against holding cost without overcommitting given no in-transit stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: recent 3 weeks (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) avg = (32+49+62)/3 = 47.67 vs earlier 2 weeks (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14) avg = (6+13)/2 = 9.5 (+402%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand shows a clear upward regime (periods 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04 avg \u224847.7 vs earlier \u22489.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=72 (order from P1) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Use promised lead time (default) since no concluded lead-time evidence. Set demand forecast using recent_N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime; use recent_N=3 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to raise base-stock for the higher recent mean while using observed pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Recent demand regime is higher: last 3 sample weeks (2019-01-21..2019-02-04) show much higher mean than earlier. On-hand=0, in-transit=142 (previous orders not concluded yet) so shipments appear delayed but no concluded arrivals to infer new lead time. To be conservative, keep promised lead time and use a recent-demand estimate to capture the new higher demand regime. L uses default promised lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to reflect the confirmed higher recent demand (short recent regime of 3 weeks). This raises target base-stock to improve service while limiting holding risk since holding cost equals profit.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand has risen sharply (carry-over shows regime shift: recent weeks avg ~47.7 vs earlier ~9.5). On-hand=0, in-transit=230 (no concluded arrivals yet) so no confirmed lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default) and base mu/sigma on the most recent high-demand regime (last 3 periods) to capture the elevated demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand weeks. This balances higher service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand has shifted up: last 3 sample weeks average = 47.67. All orders placed in Periods 1-4 (72,70,88,42 = 272 units in-transit) have not concluded/arrived by their promised lead time, indicating lost shipments or substantially longer lead time. To be conservative I set L explicit=8 to allow the OR engine to plan for a longer pipeline given missing arrivals. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (the confirmed higher-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to capture recent volatility. This balances higher service level for the new demand regime while recognizing holding cost by capping orders via the backend cap.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed Periods 1-4 (total 272 units) showed arrived=0 by their expected arrivals \u2192 suspect lost shipments or actual lead time >4 (evidence: 4 consecutive periods with no arrivals).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). On-hand=35, in-transit=288. History shows P5 conclude: arrived=72 (ordered P1, lead_time=4) \u2014 confirms actual lead time = 4. Pipeline + on-hand (323) comfortably covers several periods of elevated demand. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4. Demand has shifted up relative to earliest samples; I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to base forecast on the five most recent demand observations (Periods 1-5). I keep sigma_hat at default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices align the OR backend's base-stock with confirmed lead time and recent higher demand while using conservative volatility for safety versus stockouts or excess holding.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand regime is higher: last 3 samples (2019-01-21..2019-02-04) avg=47.67 vs earlier avg=9.5. Concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5 arrived=72, P2->P6 arrived=70). On-hand=66, in-transit=218. I set L based on observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new higher-demand regime so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time = 4 (orders placed P1-P3 arrived P5-P7 with W=4), so use observed lead time. Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spike: concluded demands in last 3 selling periods (P5-P7) = [37,39,24], mean = 33.33. On-hand=130 and in-transit=130 provide ample pipeline (total 260) but we still set forecast over the review+lead horizon (1+L=5). Choices: L set by calculate to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=3 to capture the latest demand regime (most relevant to next 5 periods) so the OR engine sizes base stock to meet current demand level while avoiding excess holding cost. This balances service (avoid stockouts given confirmed L=4) and holding (profit=holding costs equal, so be conservative with recent lower mean).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent realized arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). Current position: on-hand=134, in-transit=88. Demand has shown a prior upward regime (early Jan samples) but the most recent sales (Periods 6-8: 39, 24, 38) average ~33.7, lower than the initial spike. To keep pipeline aligned with observed lead time and recent demand, I set L via calculate to use observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 to reflect the latest regime (short-term mean ~33.7 across the review+lead horizon). This balances service (uses current observed lead time and recent demand) against holding cost given profit=holding -> critical fractile 0.5 (z\u22480).

Recent demand has moderated from the early spike; using recent 5 periods (P5\u2013P9 demands = 37,39,24,38,31; mean=33.8) to capture the current regime for forecasting across the review+lead horizon (1+L=5). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent variability. These settings balance service (cover ~5 periods of current demand) against holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in history). To keep service while limiting holding cost, use the promised/default lead time and set demand forecast using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the new higher mean and volatility.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Observed confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals show 4). Recent demand has increased (Periods 9-12 show high variability with peaks P10=76, P11=93, P12=53). To capture the recent higher-demand regime while honoring observed lead time, set L via calculate (use observed lead times average). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the last 5 demand observations (Periods 8-12) so the OR backend targets service for the elevated demand while limiting excess holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=0, in-transit=277. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Recent demand has moved higher vs early-Jan regime; last 5 observed demands (Periods 9-13) = 31,76,93,53,39 (mean \u224858.4) so I use a recent-5 estimate to capture the current elevated regime and recent volatility. I set L by calculation (use observed lead times) so the OR backend uses confirmed LT=4. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the current demand level and variance, helping the backend raise base stock to avoid stockouts while controlling holding given equal profit/holding costs.

Demand recent window (Periods 5\u201314) shows higher and more variable demand vs early samples; to capture the current regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (last 10 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_recent and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_recent.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in history). On-hand(35)+in-transit(219)=254. With L=4, review+lead horizon =5 weeks; (1+L)*recent mean \u2248262, so pipeline is slightly below a 5-week coverage \u2014 use a recent-sample forecast to reflect the current lower regime while keeping lead-time anchored at observed value. Choices: L by calculate to lock to observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat by recent_N (N=5) to capture the current demand regime and volatility for the OR engine.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand has been elevated and volatile (recent demands: 31,76,93,53,39,39,38,86), so I base forecast on the most recent regime. I set L via calculation to reflect observed lead times. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the current higher mean and variability; this increases base_stock to maintain service during lead time while avoiding excessive inventory given holding cost parity with profit.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been volatile with a large spike in Period 17 (d=180) but the last 5 periods show an elevated regime (Periods 13-17 demands = 39,39,38,86,180; avg \u224876.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=121 units. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). To balance service vs holding cost I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will be 4) and use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the recently higher demand regime while keeping variance estimate responsive to recent volatility. This keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) periods of the most recent demand profile and avoids understocking after the big recent surge.

Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 4 periods (orders placed P1..P14 arrived after 4); demand has been elevated and volatile since Period 11. Set L using observed lead times (calculate) to lock in actual LT=4. For demand, use recent_N with N=8 (captures the most recent high-demand regime from P11\u2013P18) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock reflects current higher mean and volatility, while the pipeline (284) will be reconciled by the backend when computing final order. This balances service (higher mu_hat) vs holding cost by using recent data rather than long-ago low-demand samples.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime: last 5 observed demands (P15-P19) = [38,86,180,141,187], mean=126.4 \u2014 well above earlier periods. Lead time observations in concluded history consistently show 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=419 covers many future periods but some recent orders arrived late; to prioritize service given profit=holding ($1/$1) I use a lead time estimate based on observed lead times and base-stock sized to recent demand. Therefore: L set to calculate (use observed lead times average = 4); mu_hat uses recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5); sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet the elevated demand while keeping variance estimate tied to recent variability.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=0, in-transit=624. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; keep promised lead time. Demand has shifted to a higher regime starting Period 17: recent demand levels (Periods 17-20) are substantially above earlier periods. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 (Periods 17-20) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent sustained regime. L uses the default (promised) lead time=4 so the backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean over the recent window; this increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts while sigma_hat recent_N raises safety sizing to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (avoid lost sales from current high demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost (q=0.5).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 17: avg demand Periods 17-20 = 163.75 vs prior Periods 9-16 avg = 56.88 (+188%), sustained high demand since P17.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=721. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple P arrivals with lead_time=4). Demand regime shifted up at Period 17: recent demands (P17-21) = [180,141,187,147,167], mean=164.4. To cover review+lead (1+L)=5 periods and reflect the sustained high-demand regime, I use L=calculate (infer actual LT=4), mu_hat recent_N N=5 (5-period mean captures current high demand), and sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher base_stock for elevated demand) against holding cost by using recent data rather than long-run averages; in-transit 721 already provides substantial coverage so OR cap will limit orders if pipeline is sufficient.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 17 (weekly demands P17-P22 = 180,141,187,147,167,103; recent avg \u2248154). On-hand=75, in-transit=644 (pipeline total 719) which is slightly below the (1+L)-period demand implied by the recent high regime. Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. I therefore use the promised/default lead time to match observed behavior, and base demand forecasts on the most recent high-demand regime (use recent_N with N=6) so the OR engine sizes base stock and cap appropriately to restore service while limiting holding costs. Sigma is also estimated from the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 17 (week of 2019-06-03); recent weekly demands (P17\u2013P23) = [180,141,187,147,167,103,76] (7 samples). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=134, in-transit=561 (coverage is strong). I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time from concluded history. For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the sustained high-demand regime since Period 17; same N for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the backend base-stock toward recent higher mean and variance, improving service during the confirmed high-demand regime while accounting for holding cost via the backend cap.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 17 (weeks 17\u201324) with much larger weekly demand; observed lead times in concluded messages are consistently 4 periods. On-hand + in-transit = 159 + 368 = 527 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand under L=4. Therefore set L to be inferred from observations, and set demand and volatility using the most recent sustained regime (Periods 17\u201324, length 8) so the OR backend targets service for the higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=247, in-transit=390. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 17 (large jump vs earlier periods). I set L by calculation from observed lead times to confirm actual lead time to the OR engine. For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 17-25, 9 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated mean and recent volatility, helping the backend size base stock to meet higher demand while avoiding excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=270, in-transit=372. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals = orders placed 4 periods earlier \u2192 actual lead time confirmed at 4. Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 17 (sustained elevated demand); recent 10 periods (P17\u2013P26) show higher mean with variability. To reflect confirmed LT and recent high-demand regime, set L by calculation (uses observed lead times) and use recent_N=10 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock and caps to current high-demand mean and volatility while accounting for 4-period pipeline and holding cost tradeoff. No evidence of new lost shipments since LT=4 confirmation; pipeline (372) plus on-hand covers several periods of demand but we use recent data to avoid over/under-ordering.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19): on-hand=243, in-transit=365. Historical concludes show a sustained high-demand regime beginning Period 17 (Periods 17-20 avg=163.75 vs prior avg~56.9) persisting through Period 27. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods (no new evidence of change). To capture the sustained higher demand, I use recent_N for demand estimates using the post-changepoint regime (Periods 17-27, length=11). This keeps the OR backend responsive to the higher demand while leaving L at the promised/confirmed value to match observed arrivals and avoid under-ordering. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4) and a sustained higher-demand regime beginning Period 17. Current inventory: on-hand=198, in-transit=398 \u2192 total pipeline+on-hand=596, which covers several (1+L)=5 periods at the recent elevated demand level. I set L by calculating from observed lead-time conclusions to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to capture the sustained high-demand regime from Period 17\u201328 (12 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher mean and observed volatility. This balances higher service needs against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 4 periods; demand shifted to a higher regime starting Period 17 and has remained elevated through Period 29. On-hand=354, in-transit=218 provides substantial coverage but demand remains high. I set L to default (promised=4) since concluded evidence confirms 4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=13 (regime from Period 17\u201329, length=13) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using the recent high-demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given high current inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 17 (elevated weekly demand ~150+), and concluded arrivals consistently indicate a 4-period actual lead time. Current inventory (on-hand 375 + in-transit 171 = 546) covers many weeks of elevated demand, so avoid over-ordering. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period realization. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N over the sustained high-demand regime to capture the new mean/variance (N=14 covers Periods 17\u201330). These parameters bias orders toward servicing the higher demand while letting the backend cap limit extreme order quantities to control holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Current inventory: on-hand=313, in-transit=167 => pipeline+on-hand=480 units, which covers multiple upcoming weeks given high demand. I set L="calculate" to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=15 (Periods 17\u201331) to capture the sustained high-demand regime for (1+L) review+lead aggregation. I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=15 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock tuned to the elevated demand while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering or excess safety stock from older low-demand data.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (confirmed across many observations since Period 5), and a sustained higher-demand regime began at Period 17 (avg demand since P17 materially higher). No new sustained lead-time or regime shifts detected in recent concludes. To capture the sustained high-demand regime, set lead time to default (promised = 4) and use recent demand history from the post-changepoint regime: use recent_N=16 (Periods 17\u201332) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility based on the current high-demand regime.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Current inventory: on-hand=246, in-transit=256. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many orders: ordered on Pn arrived on Pn+4). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 17 and has remained elevated; I use recent data from that regime to forecast. Set L by 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirms LT=4). For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N with N=19 (Periods 17\u201335) to capture the sustained high-demand regime; sigma_hat also recent_N N=19 to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the base-stock to current high mean demand while keeping safety stock sized to recent variability, balancing service level and holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time 4). On-hand=314 and in-transit=173 provide coverage; demand regime shifted up starting Period 17 and has persisted. Set L to calculate to lock in observed lead-time=4. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the sustained high-demand regime (Periods 17\u201336, 20 samples), improving responsiveness to the new mean/variance while avoiding older low-demand data.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=314, in-transit=128. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 17 (avg ~164) and lead time consistently observed as 4. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed LT=4 from concluded arrivals. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=20 to anchor forecasts on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (captures last ~20 weeks since the changepoint) so the OR backend sizes base stock for the elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current demand variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts in high demand) vs holding cost by relying on recent regime stats rather than older low-demand samples.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=345, in-transit=89 \u2014 pipeline is healthy but demand has moderated. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history; use calculated estimate from observations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the latest lower-demand regime and reduce overordering given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; pipeline = on-hand 342 + in-transit 71 = 413 units (strong cover). Recent demand has moderated from mid-year peaks; to reflect the most recent regime and avoid overweighting early-year low samples, I use a recent window to estimate demand and volatility over the review+lead period (1+L). L set from observed history. mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=20 to capture the latest demand level and variability while smoothing week-to-week noise. These parameters keep base_stock aligned to recent demand and limit extra holding given equal profit and holding cost (q=0.5).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Historical conclude messages show a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 17 (confirmed in carry-over history) and observed lead times consistently equal to 4. Current inventory: on-hand 347, in-transit 51. To keep the OR engine aligned with the confirmed lead time I set L to 'calculate' (observed average lead time = 4). To capture the sustained post-Period-17 demand level while weighting recent volatility, I use recent_N (N=8) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 8 demand samples. This balances service (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost given current high on-hand stock.

Period 42 (2019-11-25). Current on-hand=333, in-transit=33. Recent weekly demand has been low (last several weeks demand ~15\u201332) after the mid-year high; no new sustained demand regime detected. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods historically. Given ample on-hand inventory and no new changepoint, use defaults so the OR engine computes L=promised, mu_hat and sigma_hat from full history. This avoids overreacting to short recent dips and leverages the long sample for stable base-stock sizing.

Inventory is already high and recent demand (Periods 39-42 avg ~23.8) is modest versus earlier peaks. I choose default L to use the promised/confirmed lead time, and default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the full historical demand statistics (1+L scaling and sqrt(1+L) volatility scaling). This avoids overreacting to short recent noise while the system holds ample stock; defaults balance service level vs. holding cost given current high on-hand.

Demand has fallen into a low season in recent weeks (Periods 39-43 demands = 21,15,32,27,12); I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce ordering versus earlier high-demand months.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Current on-hand=315, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... confirmations). Recent demand has been low and stable over the last 6 weeks (demands: 21,15,32,27,12,12 \u2192 avg \u224819.5), so I downgrade demand forecasts to reflect the recent regime. I choose L=calculate to lock in the empirically observed lead time average. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the current low-demand regime and recent volatility; this reduces overordering given high holding cost (holding = profit) and large on-hand inventory. These parameters bias the OR backend toward lower target base-stock and cap orders to avoid excess holding while preserving service from the ample on-hand stock.

Past concluded history repeatedly confirms actual lead time = 4 periods. To avoid overstock while matching current lower demand, keep L at promised (confirmed) level and set demand forecast using the most recent 4 weeks to capture the December downshift. sigma estimated from the same recent window to reflect reduced volatility. These choices reduce ordering relative to summer while preserving service with current high on-hand.
