======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end). Recent weeks (P42\u2013P46) show elevated demand ~311\u2013380 units/week (holiday season). Demand forecast: conservatively expect ~340 units/period near-term. With promised lead time 4 (confirmed earlier) we must cover L+1=5 periods of demand => target pipeline coverage ~5\xd7340=1700 units. Current available = on-hand 388 + in-transit 1060 = 1448, short ~252. Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so avoid large overstocks. No new lead-time or regime shifts detected. Order enough to cover the shortfall but avoid excess: place 250 units (rounded to supplier increments) to bring total closer to 1700 while limiting holding cost exposure.",
