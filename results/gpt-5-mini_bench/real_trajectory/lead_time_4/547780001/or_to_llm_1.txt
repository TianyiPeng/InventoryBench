OR recommended 90 using promised L and historical mean; that recommendation assumes higher coverage. Given confirmed L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. I am conservative: I will not fully follow OR's 90 (which would add more inventory and holding cost) because the multi-period regime shows lower sustained demand, and the large recent spike is not yet a sustained signal. However, we need to replenish pipeline because on-hand=0 and in-transit=40 may be insufficient if volatility continues. Action: place order of 50 units so pipeline + this order = 90 (40 in-transit + 50 ordered), roughly matching OR's intended incoming coverage while limiting additional holding cost if demand reverts to the lower regime. This balances caution against another spike with holding-cost control.",
