Lead time: supplier promised 4 periods. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=0; any order placed now will arrive during Period 5 (won't help Periods 1-4). Given profit=$1 and holding=$1, overstock is costly; aim to match expected demand rather than inflate safety stock.

Demand regime: historical Jan series showed an upward shift (noted in carry-over).

Lead time / arrivals: Promised lead time 4 periods. The 250 units ordered in Period1 have not concluded yet (expected to arrive in Period5 if supplier honors promised LT). No concluded arrivals exist to infer a shorter/longer actual lead time or lost order. Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=250.
