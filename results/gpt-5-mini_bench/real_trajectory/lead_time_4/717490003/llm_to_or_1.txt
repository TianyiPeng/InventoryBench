Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical samples show no sustained regime shift (49,47,19,15,14) and there are no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time. Use promised lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to let OR backend compute base_stock while avoiding premature adjustments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. No concluded arrivals yet (Period1 order still not observed), so do NOT change promised lead time. Historical weekly demand shows a sustained drop: 2019-01-07 & 2019-01-14 were high (49,47) while the last three weeks (2019-01-21,2019-01-28,2019-02-04) are lower (19,15,14). I treat this as a new low-demand regime and use recent_N=3 for demand mean and volatility to let the OR engine size base stock for the (1+L) review+lead horizon based on the recent lower average, reducing holding cost risk while preserving service. L remains default (promised lead time) because concluded lead-time evidence is absent.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: avg dropped from 48.0 (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14) to 16.0 (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) (-66.7%).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=81, no concluded arrivals yet (orders from P1/P2 remain unreported), so cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Historical series shows a sustained demand regime drop (recent low regime: 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 mean \u224816). To avoid overstating demand I use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the last 3 low-regime samples (19,15,14). This keeps forecasted (1+L)-period demand conservative (reduces excess holding) while the pipeline (81 units) provides cover for near-term demand and delayed arrivals.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=132. Historical sample set shows a prior drop in baseline (carry-over). Recent realized demand in the last 3 periods (P1=21, P2=43, P3=79) is elevated and more variable than the older samples, so use a short recent window to adapt mu_hat to current realized demand. No concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time, so keep L at promised (default). Use default sigma_hat to let OR backend use full-sample volatility scaled by review+lead period.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=218; no concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer actual lead time\u2014use promised lead time. Historical weekly samples show a sustained demand drop (recent regime = 19,15,14). I set L to default (promised 4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 to capture the lower regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 3 samples). Use sigma recent_N N=3 to reflect reduced volatility in the recent low-demand regime. This keeps orders aligned to the new lower demand while avoiding excess holding cost given holding/profit tradeoff.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=10, in-transit=250. Period 5 conclude confirmed an arrival from Period 1 with lead_time=4, so actual lead time matches promised 4. Historical demand shows a sustained downward regime starting 2019-01-21 (samples 19,15,14; mean=16) vs earlier higher mean. To avoid overstock given high pipeline and lower recent demand, keep L as default (use promised lead time) and set demand forecast based on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 3 samples. This reduces target base-stock and caps orders despite large in-transit volume, balancing service level and holding costs.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=284. Concluded arrivals show orders from P1 and P2 arrived with lead_time=4 periods, so use observed lead time. Recent demand has increased volatility (last 3 concluded demands: P4=39, P5=48, P6=122); to react to the recent regime and high recent demand I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 periods. This raises forecasted (1+L) demand to cover upcoming review+lead window while sigma reflects recent variability, balancing service-level (profit>holding) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 ordered arrived in Period 5, P2 ordered arrived in Period 6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=0, in-transit=378. Historical concludes show confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Demand regime dropped after 2019-01-14 (samples 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04 show lower mean). To reflect true lead time use calculate (avg observed = 4). To reflect the lower recent demand regime use recent_N with N=4 (last 4 samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the reduced recent mean/variance. This also prevents overstocking given large in-transit volume and $1 holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. On-hand=0, in-transit=462. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P4 all arrived after 4), so use calculated lead time. Demand has materially increased in recent periods (recent demands: 39,48,122,148,108); I treat the latest regime as the relevant forecast. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current higher mean and volatility so the OR backend stocks for the elevated demand while capping orders to limit holding costs. This also mitigates risk from any future lost shipments because pipeline is large but lead time confirmed as 4.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime (samples 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 mean=16 units/week) and lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior conclude messages. On-hand=30 and in-transit=465 provide ample coverage versus a 5-period review+lead window; pipeline appears healthy with no new lost shipments. I set L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the lower regime ((1+L)*mean_recent = 5*16 = 80 implied replenishment target). Sigma is set recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize matching the current low-demand regime to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service with the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-04-22. Recent confirmed lead time = 4. Historical demand shows a sustained regime drop (early two samples high, last four samples low). On-hand=13, in-transit=523 (very large pipeline) so avoid inflating forecasts. Set L to promised/default (4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the lower-demand regime (use last 4 samples). This reduces target base stock and avoids excess holding given large pipeline while still reflecting current lower demand.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Recent concluded demand (Periods 5-11) shows a sustained higher-demand regime vs. the early Jan samples (periods with demands 48,122,148,108,60,74,104). On-hand = 54 and large in-transit = 404; pipeline is ample so we should keep lead time at the promised/default (confirmed historically as 4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the recent high-demand regime to reflect current demand and higher variability. I choose recent_N with N=7 (Periods 5-11) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability from the most relevant regime, which balances service level (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime drop: early samples (2019-01-07,01-14) averaged 48, recent three samples (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) average 16 (-66.7%). On-hand=64 + in-transit=318 appears ample vs. lower recent demand, so we reduce forecast to reflect the new lower regime. L: use promised/default (4) consistent with confirmed lead time. mu_hat: use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new low-demand regime ((1+L)*mean_last3 = 5*16). sigma_hat: use recent_N with N=3 to reflect volatility in the recent low regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent history shows the earlier demand regime dropped (Period 2) and lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=112, in-transit=410 \u2014 ample pipeline cover vs. typical demand samples. I use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and default demand stats from all available samples to let the OR backend compute base_stock and the capped order; this avoids overfitting to recent noisy weeks while respecting the sustained regime shift already recorded. Default sigma keeps volatility estimated from full sample set so safety stock isn't undercut.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20. On-hand=157, in-transit=295. Historical sample mean (given) is 28.8 but recent realized weekly demand has risen and become volatile (Periods 10-14 demands = 74,104,160,45,70; recent mean ~90.6). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes, so use promised/default L to keep pipeline timing consistent. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the newer, higher-demand regime and elevated volatility so the OR backend raises target base-stock and accounts for recent variability.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=111, in-transit=353. Historical sample series shows a sustained demand drop beginning 2019-01-21: earlier two-week avg = 48, recent three-week avg = 16 (samples 2019-01-21,01-28,02-04). Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods in prior concluces. To avoid overstocking given large pipeline, keep promised lead time (default). Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new lower-demand regime (N=3 covers the sustained 3-period low-demand signal). This reduces target base-stock versus using all-sample averages and limits additional ordering while pipeline clears, balancing service vs. holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03. Recent demand has risen and become more variable (last 5 demands: 160,45,70,72,120; mean=93.4) while on-hand=75 and in-transit=269\u2014pipeline is large vs. current on-hand. Lead time historically confirmed as 4; use calculated L to reflect observed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher/variable demand regime (backend will scale by (1+L)). This raises the base-stock to protect service given high in-transit and recent spikes while sigma recent_N captures volatility to set safety stock appropriately.

Date 2019-06-10. On-hand=161, in-transit=254; past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Historical sample set (Jan-Feb) shows a demand drop early (carry-over note). To keep decisions aligned with confirmed lead time and the environment used by the OR engine, I use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level given current ample pipeline while avoiding overreaction to short-term fluctuation.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). SKU 717490003 has profit $4/unit, holding $1/unit/period. On-hand=99, in-transit=273. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed in prior carry-over). Recent demand regimes dropped after mid-Jan (lower mean), but available historical samples seed the forecast. To keep parameters consistent with confirmed lead time and the engine's default demand estimator, use promised/confirmed L via default and let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from samples. This balances service (using confirmed L) against holding cost given healthy pipeline inventory.

Recent demand (Periods 15-19 = 72,120,99,62,94) shows higher mean/variance than the early-Feb low-regime; to capture current regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility.

Demand recently increased and is more volatile than early-Jan samples, so use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the latest 12 demand observations and avoid stale low-Jan regime influence. These choices let the OR backend size base-stock to meet near-term demand while reflecting current variability and confirmed lead time.

Concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time; pipeline is large but recent weeks show substantially higher demand than early-year (recent demands: P18-22 = 62,94,100,211,146). To capture the current higher-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent five demand observations (captures recent spike and higher variance). This balances service (higher target stock given large recent demand) against holding cost, while the OR backend will cap orders using its cap formula and the provided lead-time estimate.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand is 0 with 653 in-transit; pipeline is large but arrivals are delayed by promised L=4 so continue using promised lead time. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime (last 5 demand periods) so the OR backend sets a base-stock reflecting recent elevated mean and volatility and avoids understocking while capping order size via its cap.

Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=25, in-transit=622. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (periods 5,6,7,8...); use promised/default L. Recent demand has been elevated and more variable compared with the early-Feb low regime; to capture current regime I use a recent_N forecast based on the most recent data (last 8 demand observations) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets service for the current higher-demand regime while avoiding overcommitting to very long tails. High pipeline (622) reduces immediate order need but mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat reflects sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std to set an appropriate base-stock and cap.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=69, in-transit=506. Historical conclude messages consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Pipeline is very large relative to recent sales; to avoid excess holding cost I will rely on the backend's default demand estimates and lead time (use promised/confirmed L=4) and default volatility so the capped ordering rule limits fresh receipts. Methods chosen: L=default (use promised/confirmed 4), mu_hat=default (backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (backend computes sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples).

Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) is the best predictor of near-term demand; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current higher-demand regime while letting the OR engine cap orders given large pipeline. This balances high service target (profit/holding \u2192 q=0.8) against holding cost and risk of excess inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). On-hand=323, in-transit=189. Historical concludes consistently show 4-period arrivals; promised lead time=4. Recent demand has been lower than early-Jan levels (carry-over noted drop). To avoid overstock while maintaining service with current lower demand regime, use promised lead time and a recent-window demand estimate to capture current mean/volatility. I select recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 20 samples, which adapts to the sustained lower-demand regime and limits excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals at 4). On-hand=330, in-transit=144 \u2014 ample pipeline covering several weeks of demand. Early sample series shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 3; no new sustained changepoint detected in recent weeks. Use default lead time (promised 4) so backend keeps consistency with observed arrivals, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this avoids overfitting to short-term noise while pipeline remains healthy and holding cost is nontrivial (holding=$1 vs profit=$4).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=226, in-transit=149. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in prior insight). Recent demand shows higher levels vs early-year dip; last 5 demand samples (Periods 25-29) average ~87 units/week, so I set mu_hat using recent_N to focus the forecast on the latest regime (helps the backend compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean). I keep L at default (promised 4, matches observed) and set sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect recent volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Current on-hand=175, in-transit=249 (no concluded overdue shipments). Historical lead times consistently observed =4. Demand has shown a lower post-Jan regime and recent demand has averaged ~80 units/week (Periods 26-30: 82,59,90,118,51). To capture current demand regime I use recent_N (N=5) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent weeks. Use default promised lead time (4) since concluded history confirms L=4. This balances a high service target (profit/holding => q=0.8) with current elevated on-hand + pipeline to avoid excess ordering.

Demand has a lower, stable regime versus Jan samples; use a recent-N demand estimate to reflect current demand. Choose L=default to use promised 4; mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 demand observations (captures recent lower-demand regime); sigma_hat=default to let backend scale volatility over (1+L). These choices keep replenishment responsive to recent demand while avoiding excessive overstock given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been lower since the early drop (carry-over) and the last 5 concluded weekly demands are: 51,28,37,? (we use most recent 5 samples). To avoid overstock while preserving service with confirmed L=4, I use default lead time (promised=4) and recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent regime, reducing bias from older high-demand periods. This balances profit-driven service level (profit=$4 vs holding=$1) against holding cost given already large on-hand + pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent weekly demand has stabilized well above the early-Jan low; last 5 demands = {28,37,51,38,26} (mean ~36). On-hand=271 and in-transit=140 (total pipeline 411) \u2014 ample cover vs one-month horizon but holding cost = $1/unit/period favors avoiding excess. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. I choose L=default (use promised 4). To capture the recent higher-demand regime and reduce sensitivity to old low-demand samples, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 (captures the most recent regime while smoothing variability). These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward current demand levels while the cap prevents excessive single-period orders, balancing service and holding cost.

Set L by averaging observed lead times to confirm real lead-time signal; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture current lower-demand regime and recent volatility, which balances service (using recent demand) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2019-10-28. Recent concluded history (Periods 5\u201337) consistently shows actual lead time = 4 and no new sustained demand regime shift; on-hand=239, in-transit=230 (healthy pipeline). Use promised/default lead time so OR backend uses stable L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample statistics scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) because demand has varied historically but no new 3+ period sustained shift detected; defaults give conservative forecast and prevent over-ordering given already-high inventory, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Historical data and prior carry-over show a sustained demand regime drop in Feb/Mar 2019 and lead time confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand=352 and in-transit=100 (ample coverage). To avoid overreacting to older high-demand episodes while capturing recent lower weekly sales (recent demands: 38,26,18,24,17), I set L to default (promised 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the current low-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility. This biases orders toward lower replenishment given high on-hand, reducing holding cost while meeting service-level implied by profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. On-hand=337, in-transit=100 \u2014 ample cover vs recent demand; no new missed arrivals. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods. Demand has been low/stable in recent weeks (last 8 demands avg \u224828.25/week). To keep service while limiting holding cost, keep L as default (promised=4) and set demand estimates using recent data (N=8) so the OR base-stock reflects the lower recent regime; match sigma to recent sample volatility (N=8). This reduces excess replenishment compared with using all-sample averages.

To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, set L to promised (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent 5 weeks (recent_N=5) so mu_hat = (1+L)*recent_mean (5*17\u224885). Use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect recent low-volatility.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (Periods 35-41 demands = 26,18,24,17,15,11,12; recent mean \u2248 17.6). Lead time was previously confirmed as 4; no new evidence of change. On-hand=414, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage vs. recent demand. To align the backend forecast with the current low-demand regime I use recent_N over the last 7 weeks for demand mean and volatility (captures the sustained low-demand pattern) and keep L as default (promised lead time = 4). This raises service level (q\u22480.8 given profit/holding) while avoiding overreaction to older high-demand periods.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. On-hand=392, in-transit=0; recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 and a sustained lower-demand regime vs. early Jan. Given very high on-hand (large safety buffer) I choose conservative/default estimates so the OR engine will compute base-stock from the promised lead time and full-sample demand stats, avoiding unnecessary replenishment. Methods: L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). No new carry-over patterns to record.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/09. Recent weekly demand has been in a lower regime (many weeks ~7\u201322 units) since the early-year drop; profit/holding implies high service target (q=0.8). On-hand=385, in-transit=31 \u2014 inventory is ample vs current low demand and no recently concluded arrivals (no lost-shipment signal). Set L to promised lead time to match confirmed historical 4-period behavior. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast/volatility on the sustained low-demand regime and avoid overweighting the brief high-demand early-Jan samples; this keeps base-stock aligned with current demand while the OR backend enforces the service-level cap.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=377, in-transit=31. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. To rely on the confirmed long-run statistics and let the OR engine compute the base-stock and cap using all historical samples, I use default lead time and default demand moments. This keeps ordering tied to the full-sample mean/variance, balancing the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost tradeoff without overfitting to short-term noise.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Recent weekly demand is low (single-digit to low teens in Nov\u2013Dec) and on-hand inventory is high (361) with 35 in-transit. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. To avoid unnecessary additional stock while honoring the supplier promise and the confirmed lead time, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates based on all samples so the OR backend applies its full-sample baseline (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps service level high (profit/holding \u2192 q=0.8) but relies on existing data rather than short-term fluctuations given ample on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. On-hand=345, in-transit=46. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default L to keep OR backend aligned. Recent demand has been in a lower stable regime (~last 8 weeks: demands 15,11,12,22,7,8,16,16), so set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 to reflect the current low-mean, low-volatility regime and avoid overstocking. This balances high service target (profit/holding => q=0.8) with holding cost given large on-hand inventory and some in-transit units.
