  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, pre-New Year) \u2014 recent spike (Period 45=115, P46=71) likely holiday-driven and not necessarily sustained. Demand analysis: last 5 periods demand = {33,9,13,115,71} -> avg\u224848/unit but highly volatile; longer pre-holiday regime was low (Periods ~39\u201344 mostly single- to low-double digits). Lead time & pipeline: historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Current in-transit = 300 (ordered P46) will arrive in Period 50 (P46+4). This means no arrivals will occur during Periods 47\u201349; those periods' demand must be met from on-hand only. Inventory assessment: on-hand=35 \u2014 insufficient to cover expected demand before the P50 arrival (need roughly 3\xd7avg\u2248144 units for P47\u2013P49), so some lost sales before arrival are unavoidable because any new order placed now would also arrive after 4 periods (too late to prevent stockouts). Order policy: avoid placing additional order this period because a large shipment (300) is already en route and excessive new ordering increases holding cost and risk of overstock after the P50 arrival. Instead rely on the 300 arriving in P50 and reassess after observing arrivals and realized demand. Action: place 0 units now.",
