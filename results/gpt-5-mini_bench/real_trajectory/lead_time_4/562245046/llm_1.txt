{
  "rationale": "a) World/calendar: Date 2019-12-23 \u2192 pre-Christmas shopping; short-term elevated demand likely this week. Product is womens trousers (everyday apparel) which sees holiday purchases. b) Demand regime: Recent unconstrained demand spikes (Periods 42\u201343 large lost sales 999/922) then constrained weeks (P44 demand210 sold150, P45 demand245 sold200). True weekly demand signal is elevated vs earlier non-holiday weeks; use conservative short-horizon forecast. c) Lead time / pipeline: Actual lead time confirmed = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=1800 (this is from orders placed in P44 and P45: 1200 arriving in Period 48, 500 arriving in Period 49). No arrivals will occur in Periods 46 or 47. d) Inventory need: Because next arrivals come in Period 48, we must cover Periods 46\u201347 demand from on-hand or a new order placed now will not arrive until Period 50 (too late). Therefore place minimal new order to avoid future overstock given large incoming pipeline. e) Forecast & order logic: Forecast elevated but constrained recent sales ~200\u2013300/week; holiday week (P46) may be higher, so cover two-week demand with safety. Recommend ordering 800 units to cover Periods 46\u201347 demand + safety while avoiding excessive holding once the 1800 in-transit arrives.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) VM Action:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Calendar/world: Period 47 = 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, holiday season demand spikes recently seen). Demand analysis: Recent true demand is high and variable; recent observed demand (Periods 41-46) shows large unmet demand due to stockouts (e.g., Periods 42\u201343 reported demand 999,922 while sold limited by inventory). Historical high-regime average ~300\u2013400/wk with holiday spikes >900. Lead time/pipeline: Promised and empirically confirmed lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=2500 (these correspond to orders from Periods 44\u201346: 1200,500,800) which will arrive across upcoming periods (P48:1200, P49:500, P50:800) and are therefore sufficient to cover several upcoming weeks of demand. Ordering now would arrive in Period 51 and cannot help the immediate P47 shortage; given sizable pipeline and nontrivial holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit $4/unit, placing additional order now risks unnecessary holding costs. Final action: place no order this period and let in-transit receipts cover upcoming demand while observing realized arrivals to update lead-time/shortage signals.",
