Product: lightweight V-neck women\u2019s top \u2014 relevant for late winter\u2192early-spring; no abrupt seasonality sign yet. Demand analysis: historical weekly sales for this SKU: 2019-01-07:46, 2019-01-14:56, 2019-01-21:43, 2019-01-28:44, 2019-02-04:76. Recent 4-week average (Jan14\u2013Feb04) = 54.75 \u2248 55 units/week; latest week shows a spike to 76 which may be a short-term uplift (Valentine/seasonal push). Lead time & pipeline: promised lead time = 4 periods; on-hand = 0, in-transit = 0, and no concluded arrivals to infer a different lead time. Must cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand (current period demand happens after decision). Order logic: using a conservative forecast of ~55 units/week (with slight upward bias from recent spike), target coverage = 5 \xd7 55 = 275 units. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given long lead time) versus holding cost ($1/unit/period) and profit ($4/unit). No shipments are outstanding to rely on.",
