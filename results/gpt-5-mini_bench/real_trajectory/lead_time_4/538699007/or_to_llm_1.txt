======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history (Period5 shows P1 order arrived in P5) confirms actual lead time = 4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments recently. Demand analysis: recent concluded demands (Periods 42\u201346: 9,4,7,5,13) show a sustained low-demand regime (~8\u20139 units/week), consistent with carry-over insights indicating multi-period declines ending at ~20\u2192~8\u201313. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand = 101, in-transit = 0. With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 upcoming periods; expected 5-period demand \u2248 5\xd79 = 45 units. Holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($4/unit) favors avoiding excess inventory. OR recommended 157 but used promised L and historical higher demand; given current on-hand already > expected 5-period demand, placing additional order would increase holding cost with little upside. Decision: place 0 units this period to let inventory absorb the low-demand regime and avoid unnecessary holding cost. Will monitor next concluded periods for any sustained uptick before ordering.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Demand has fallen to ~8\u20139 units/week and with confirmed 4-period lead time our on-hand 101 already covers ~11 weeks; cancel ordering (0 units) to avoid excess holding cost versus OR's 157 recommendation.",
