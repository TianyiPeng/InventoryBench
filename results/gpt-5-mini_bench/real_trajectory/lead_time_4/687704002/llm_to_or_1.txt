Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU is ladies denim with rising weekly demand in recent historical samples (0,0,26,111,277 through 2019-02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals observed, so cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. I choose L=default to rely on promised 4-period lead time. Demand shows an upward trend but evidence is limited (5 samples) and not yet 3+ periods of a sustained new regime, so use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples). This balances avoiding stockouts for a rising SKU while not overcommitting inventory given holding cost=$1/unit.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=277 (order placed Period 1). No 'arrived' conclude for that order yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; do not assume shipment loss. Use promised lead time and historical samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) for demand stats. Choose default L to keep backend using promised 4-period lead time; choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given a recent large order in transit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent realized weekly demand has moved materially higher: samples 2019-02-04=277, Period1 demand=266, Period2 demand=158 (three consecutive high-demand periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=603; promised lead time=4. No concluded arrivals yet, so do NOT infer actual lead time. I set L to default (use promised 4) because we lack concluded lead-time evidence. I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the new high-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of the last 3 samples). I set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices bias the OR engine toward a larger base stock to cover the sustained demand increase while keeping variability estimation tied to the most recent data; this helps avoid stockouts given the large in-transit shortfall relative to a 5-period demand forecast.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift from 2019-01-07..2019-01-28 (avg=34.25) to 2019-02-04..2019-02-25 (avg=233.67, +582%), sustained for 3 periods (277,266,158).

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=945; recent concluded periods show no arrivals (arrived=0) so cannot confirm actual lead time deviating from promised. Demand shows a sustained upward regime beginning early Feb (higher weekly sales). I set L to default (promised 4) because no concluded arrivals provide an observed lead-time to calculate or recent-average. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the newly elevated regime (use the last 3 demand observations) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Volatility likely changed with the regime, so sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent std. This biases orders toward covering the elevated demand while keeping holding cost in mind given high in-transit stock.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand shows a sustained upward regime (277,266,158) beginning Feb; on-hand=0, in-transit=1185 but no concluded arrivals (possible delays/losses) so cannot confirm actual lead time. Use promised lead time (default) for L. For demand, use recent regime mean: recent_N N=3 to capture the uplift. Apply recent_N N=3 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders up to meet the confirmed higher demand while keeping lead-time assumption conservative given lack of arrival confirmations.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=188, in-transit=908; observed arrival in Period 5 confirms an observed lead time of 4 periods for the P1 order. Demand has shifted up since early Feb (sustained higher regime). I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (evidence: Period 5 conclude: ordered on P1 arrived in P5, lead_time=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the new higher-demand regime (uses last 6 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean). I also use recent_N N=6 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline reduces immediate stockout risk; recent-N estimates avoid diluting the new regime with old low-demand data.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=418, in-transit=638. Two concluded arrivals show orders placed P1->arrived P5 and P2->arrived P6 => observed lead times = 4,4; actual lead time confirmed at 4. Demand has moderated in the last 3 concluded periods (P4..P6 demands = 117,89,96). To keep pipeline sized for the current short-term regime and limit holding cost, set L by calculation from observed lead times, and set demand forecasts and volatility using the most recent 3 periods (captures current lower-demand regime). These parameters prioritize matching supply to recent demand and avoid excess inventory buildup while honoring confirmed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1420.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1. Recent history shows actual lead time = 4 (orders on P1..P3 arrived in P5..P7). Demand has shifted from very high spikes (Feb) back to a lower recent regime (Periods 5-7 demands = 89,96,109). On-hand=651, in-transit=296 (pipeline=947) comfortably covers near-term demand; avoid overstock by sizing forecast to recent lower regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the most recent demand regime (uses Periods 5-7), so base-stock targets service for current demand level rather than older spike data. Set sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture current volatility; this reduces safety stock compared with using all-sample volatility and limits holding cost given large on-hand.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/08. Observed concluded lead times: Period1->5,2->6,3->7,4->8 => actual lead time confirmed = 4. On-hand=754 + in-transit=56 provides ample coverage vs recent demand. Demand has softened from the early spike (277,266,158) to more recent periods (117,89,96,109,137); I treat this as a new lower regime. Set L by calculating average of observed lead times to confirm actual L=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 (last 5 demand periods) to capture the recent lower mean and volatility, so the OR backend targets service with lower replenishment while avoiding excess holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. On-hand=657, in-transit=56. Historical concluded arrivals show orders from P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8 (all lead_time=4), so lead time is stable at 4. Demand has moved to a higher regime versus the early-Jan baseline; recent demand (last 7 concluded periods) averages materially above the earlier low samples, so I focus the forecast on recent data. I set L via calculate (to use observed lead times), set mu_hat and sigma_hat via recent_N with N=7 to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to protect service given the confirmed 4-period lead time while keeping holding cost awareness by using recent volatility for the cap.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (orders P1 arrived P5, P2 arrived P6, P3 arrived P7, P4 arrived P8).

Use promised lead time (default=4). Set mu_hat using recent_N=7 to capture the most recent regime (7 periods of post-arrival demand) so the (1+L) forecast reflects current cooled demand. Set sigma_hat using recent_N=7 to reflect recent demand volatility. This reduces overstock risk given high on-hand and low in-transit while maintaining service level.

LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=465, in-transit=8. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4 (Periods 5\u201310 evidence). Demand regime shifted up starting 2019-02-04 and persisted (carry-over note). To reflect the sustained higher demand and minimize stockouts while respecting holding cost, I set L to promised (default) and use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the 8 most recent demand observations since the regime change). This biases base-stock upward to meet the higher recent demand while sigma_hat from recent samples informs safety stock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; on-hand=418, in-transit=94 so pipeline is healthy. Recent demand has fallen from the earlier spike; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 9-13) = [97,87,67,94,47], recent mean ~78.4. To avoid excess hold while preserving service for the 4-period lead, set L=default (promised 4), use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the lower recent regime, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances high profit (q\u22480.95) with lower holding cost by sizing base stock to recent demand patterns and observed reliable lead time.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has settled well above the early low regime; last 10 weekly demands = [89,96,109,137,97,87,67,94,47,75], mean\u224889.8. On-hand=343, in-transit=94 (pipeline=437) \u2014 ample cover but demand still variable. Confirmed lead time=4 in history, so use promised lead time. Use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-shift demand level and volatility over the most recent 10 weeks, letting the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (use recent elevated mean) against holding costs given high on-hand inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent demand has settled well below the Feb spike: last 12 concluded demands (Periods 5\u201316) = [89,96,109,137,97,87,67,94,47,75,56,48], avg\u224889. On-hand=247 + in-transit=407 \u2192 pipeline=654, so current coverage is ample versus recent weekly demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. I select L=default to trust promised/confirmed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=12 to capture the current lower-demand regime (12-period recent sample, within allowed caps). Sigma also uses recent_N N=12 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias ordering toward the current lower mean and observed variability, reducing holding cost while maintaining service given the confirmed L and sizable pipeline.

Recent demand (Periods 8\u201317) shows a lower, stable regime (10 samples; mean \u224875.5/week) vs earlier spike\u2014use recent data to avoid overstating demand. Set L=default (promised 4, confirmed). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=10 to capture current regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=10 to reflect recent volatility. This reduces ordering toward current lower demand while preserving service level given high profit ($19) and low holding cost ($1).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=247, in-transit=321 gives ample pipeline but demand regime has downshifted since Periods 5\u201311. I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 12\u201318 samples: 94,47,75,56,48,47,39) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7current local mean and sigma_hat uses recent_N to capture current volatility, reducing overreaction to the earlier spike while keeping service against 4-period coverage.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=316 + in-transit=219 provides large coverage vs. current demand; no overdue lost shipments and historical concluded lead times are consistently 4. I set L to default (promised 4) since concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the post-spike lower regime mean and variance ((1+L)\xd7recent mean) and reduced volatility, so the OR backend will target a base-stock appropriate to current lower demand while avoiding excess holding given high on-hand inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/8 (Period 22). On-hand=488, in-transit=0. Historical conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has settled substantially below the Feb spike: last 10 demand observations (Periods 12\u201321) show a lower, stable regime (demands: 94,47,75,56,48,47,39,33,20,27 \u2192 avg\u224854.6; recent tail is lower but using 10 samples captures short-term volatility). To avoid stockouts while recognizing holding cost, set L to promised (confirmed=4), use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat to reflect the current lower-demand regime across the review+lead window, and recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility.

Recent demand has been low and stable (last many periods: 27,39,24, etc.), so using recent data avoids inflating forecasts with the early high-demand spike in Feb. I set L=default to use the promised (and confirmed) 4-period lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduced variability, which will lower the base stock and cap orders to avoid excessive holding given the large on-hand position.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/29 (Period 25). Recent weekly demand has settled at low levels (last 8 demands: 33,39,24,14,27,39,24,14 \u2014 avg \u2248 27), while on-hand is high (411) and in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To avoid overstocking given current low demand and high on-hand, use a recent-window demand estimate to reflect the lower regime. Select L=default (promised 4), mu_hat based on recent 8 samples to capture current low mean, and sigma_hat based on recent 8 samples to capture recent volatility; this will reduce target base stock vs. using all-sample averages and limit new orders.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=368, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled well below the Feb spike: last 8 demands = [39,33,20,27,39,24,14,43], mean \u224829.9. Promised lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods; keep default L to match supply expectations. Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the current low-demand regime and reduce excess replenishment. This biases base_stock lower (reducing holding cost) while retaining service given sizable on-hand inventory.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent weekly demand has settled at a lower run-rate vs the Feb spike; last 7 demands = [20,27,39,24,14,43,54] (mean ~33). On-hand = 314, in-transit = 0 (no pending arrivals). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; use calculated lead time to reflect evidence. To avoid overstock while covering review+lead demand, set mu_hat using a recent-window mean (captures current lower regime) and sigma_hat from the same recent window to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize matching stock to current demand while the OR backend computes service-level buffer.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=183, in-transit=18 \u2192 pipeline=201 units, recent weekly demand is low/moderate (last weeks: 54,74,57, etc.). Observed lead times historically confirmed as 4 periods; no evidence of new lost shipments. To align ordering with the current lower-demand regime and avoid excess holding cost (holding=$1 vs profit=$19), I use the promised lead time (default=4) and base the demand forecast and volatility on the recent stable regime. I select recent_N with N=18 to capture the post-February steady demand pattern while smoothing over short-week noise. These parameters reduce excess safety stock while keeping service given profitable sales.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has settled well below the large Feb peak: last 5 weeks demands = [43,54,74,57,44], mean=54.4. Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4. On-hand=139, in-transit=101 \u2014 ample pipeline. To avoid overstock while meeting service, keep promised lead time and base forecasts on recent regime: set L=default (promised=4), mu_hat from recent_N (N=5) to capture current lower weekly demand multiplied by (1+L), and sigma_hat from recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This reduces ordering toward the post-spike demand regime while retaining safety for 4-period lead time.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has moderated compared to the Feb spike; last 5 period demands = [54,74,57,44,48] (mean \u224855). On-hand=91 + in-transit=177 => pipeline_inventory=268, covering multiple weeks given L=4. No new sustained lead-time or regime change observed. Set L to default (promised = 4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to focus forecast on the most recent regime (5-period mean scaled by review+lead). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent demand volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to current lower demand while leveraging existing pipeline to avoid excess ordering and holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/16 (Period 32). On-hand=43, in-transit=229. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4 (recorded earlier). Recent demand (last 8 periods: 14,43,54,74,57,44,48,48) averages ~47.75/week; demand appears stable at ~40\u201360 units recently. I use promised lead time (default) and recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, keeping orders responsive to the current lower-volatility regime while avoiding excess holding given $1 holding cost and $19 profit. Current pipeline (43+229=272) already covers ~5\xd747.75\u2248239 expected demand over review+lead, so this choice will let the backend scale orders down if pipeline exceeds the computed base_stock.

Recent demand (Periods 28-32 = 57,44,48,48,50) shows a new lower stable regime vs earlier spike; use recent data to forecast (covering review+lead). Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead-time=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend orders to replenish pipeline but avoids excess holding cost given high on-hand + in-transit.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=8, in-transit=171. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4; no shipments currently overdue. Recent demand has been modest since spring with occasional spikes (last 8 concluded demands: Periods 26-33 = 54,74,57,44,48,48,50,86) \u2014 lower than the early-Feb high regime. To avoid excess holding while preserving service, keep L as promised (default=4) but set demand forecast and volatility from the recent window (N=8) to reflect the current regime and recent variability; this reduces reliance on early high-demand samples and limits overstock risk given holding cost $1 vs profit $19.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history. To balance service level vs holding cost I use the promised/default lead time and focus mu/sigma on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the current demand regime while avoiding overweighting the early 2019 spike. This keeps base-stock responsive to current demand and limits excess inventory buildup given low holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has settled to modest weekly sales (past 12 weeks roughly 40\u201390, several weeks in 40s\u201380s) and we currently hold 3 on-hand + 220 in-transit. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time. I therefore use the promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This keeps the backend's base-stock anchored to long-run observed demand while the pipeline (220) plus on-hand covers multiple weeks, reducing risk of over-ordering given holding cost = $1 and profit = $19.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weekly demand over the last 6 conclude periods (P32\u2013P37) averages ~74 units/week, a stable post-peak regime (samples: 50,86,81,52,82,93). On-hand=0, in-transit=402 \u2014 pipeline currently covers ~5 weeks of expected demand. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments recently. I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the current lower, stable regime and avoid contamination from the early 2019 spike. I set sigma_hat recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters keep the OR base-stock tuned to current weekly demand while the large in-transit volume prevents urgent ordering, balancing service level and holding cost.

Pipeline + on-hand roughly covers (1+L)*recent_mean (5*72=360) so no urgent replenishment risk; keep promised lead time. Set L to default (promised=4). Set mu_hat using recent_N N=7 to capture the new higher post-Feb demand regime reflected in sustained recent weeks. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=7 to reflect recent volatility for the OR engine's safety stock sizing.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has settled well below the Feb peak; last 6 demands (P35-P39): 52,82,93,60,51,51 \u2014 showing moderate variability and lower mean. On-hand=66 + in-transit=308 => pipeline_inventory=374, which comfortably covers several weeks at current run-rate; no overdue/lost shipments observed (lead time historically confirmed =4). I'll use promised lead time (default L=4) so the OR engine uses the known contract. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to focus the forecast on the current lower regime (reduces over-ordering versus using all-sample mean). Sigma uses default to let backend compute volatility from full history scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (protect against stockouts) while avoiding excessive holding given already-large pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Current on-hand=187, in-transit=300. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmations P1\u2192P5..P4\u2192P8). No recent sustained changepoint in demand since earlier documented regime shift; pipeline appears healthy (300 in-transit) but arrivals only visible next period. I select L=default to trust promised lead time (matches confirmed observations). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses the full-sample mean and variance scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively\u2014this yields a baseline base-stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost while letting the OR engine cap orders via its built-in cap. This conservative choice avoids overreacting to short-term noise and accounts for the confirmed 4-period lead time and existing pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=189, in-transit=327. Historical lead time has been consistently 4 periods (confirmed earlier). Recent demand (most recent 20 weeks) better reflects current regime than full-history (early large spikes would bias mean/variance). Therefore use promised lead time (default) and recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sets base stock to cover current demand volatility while avoiding excess inventory from old high-demand samples.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=106, in-transit=291 (pipeline+on-hand=397) entering a 4-period promised lead time environment. Recent weekly demand has trended up (Periods 38-42: 60,51,49,53,119) with a large single spike in P42 but otherwise elevated vs earlier months. All observed lead times have been 4 historically; no evidence to change L. To be responsive to the recent uptick while limiting excess holding, I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat reflects the latest regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=5) to measure recent volatility. This keeps pipeline sizing aligned to the near-term demand pattern while leveraging the confirmed lead time.

Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4; keep L as default (promised). Recent demand shows elevated, variable weekly sales around late Oct\u2013Nov (e.g., periods 38\u201343 demands: 60,51,49,53,119,39) and Dec holiday can add variability. To adapt to the recent regime while avoiding excess holding cost, I use recent_N=6 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the last 6 demand samples, capturing the recent mean/volatility and holiday variability.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Current on-hand=238, in-transit=140 (total pipeline=378). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6 ... P40\u2192P44), so I use a calculated lead time to reflect observed reality. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift earlier in Feb (higher mean) but recent weeks (Periods 42-44: 119,39,38) show no new sustained change. I select L by "calculate" (uses observed lead times = 4). For demand mean and volatility I choose the backend defaults (mu_hat="default", sigma_hat="default") so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) using the full history. This keeps the policy aligned with the confirmed lead time while letting the OR engine weight the full demand history to balance service level vs holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

I choose L=calculate to lock actual observed lead time (avg of concluded lead times). Demand forecast: use recent_N for mu_hat (N=8) to focus on the most recent demand regime and capture year-end patterns while covering the review+lead horizon (1+L periods). Volatility left to default for sigma_hat to reflect overall sample variability. These settings keep base_stock responsive to the higher recent mean while sigma default avoids overfitting to short-term noise, balancing service level vs holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory and holding cost=$1/unit.
