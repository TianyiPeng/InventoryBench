Observations: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals so promised L=4 unconfirmed. Demand shows a sharp upward shift over the last 3 weeks (26\u2192111\u2192277). With profit=19 and holding=1 the cost structure justifies carrying extra safety stock to avoid costly stockouts. Risk: promised lead time may be \u22654 and orders could be delayed or lost, so relying only on OR's capped 277 risks repeated stockouts if the recent high demand persists. Decision: exceed OR cap but stop short of full theoretical base-stock to limit exposure if the spike reverses.

Demand estimate: use full concluded history (P1\u2013P8 demands = 266,158,115,117,89,96,109,137). Empirical mean \u03bc\u0304 = 135.875 units/week, sample std \u03c3\u0304 \u2248 56.9. For (1+L)=5: \u03bc\u0302 = 679.4, \u03c3\u0302 \u2248 127.2. OR base-stock (with z*=\u03a6\u22121(19/(19+1))=\u03a6\u22121(0.95)\u22481.645) gives base_stock \u2248 \u03bc\u0302 + z*\u03c3\u0302 \u2248 888.7 \u2192 order_raw \u2248 888.7 \u2212 653 = 235.7. OR recommended 238 (matches). Adjustment: recent 4-week mean is lower (~107.8/week) implying some softening vs the full-history mean; however the earlier high weeks appear real demand (not stockouts) and carry-over flagged a sustained regime shift earlier. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) (critical fractile \u2192 heavy bias to avoid stockouts) and confirmed L=4, I will slightly trim OR's 238 to 200 to modestly reduce holding risk while keeping strong protection against stockouts. This keeps pipeline + order = 853, covering ~6.3 weeks at recent mean and ~6.27 weeks at full-history mean/5-period requirement. No new sustained pattern meets the 3+ period significance threshold, so no new carry-over insight is recorded.",

Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: actual lead time is confirmed as 4 periods (multiple concluded messages show orders arriving 4 periods after order). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=1, in-transit=335. Demand outlook: carry-over insight indicates current regime avg \u224878.8/week \u2192 (L+1)=5-period demand \u2248 5\xd778.8 \u2248 394 units. Pipeline+on-hand = 336, slightly below 5-period expected demand but pipeline is large and recent arrivals have been reliable with LT=4, so most demand before any new order placed will be covered by the in-transit inventory. OR recommended 159 uses promised LT and historical samples but would raise inventory significantly and incur extra holding cost ($1/unit/period) despite already-large pipeline. Timing: any order placed now would arrive only after 4 periods (too late to cover near-term demand) and would increase holding costs thereafter. Risk of lost shipments appears low given consistent 4-period arrivals. Decision: place 0 units to avoid overstock and holding cost; monitor concluded arrivals over next 1\u20132 periods and reorder only if we observe missing arrivals or pipeline depletion relative to realized demand.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Override OR (159\u21920): with lead time reliably 4 and in-transit=335 (plus on-hand=1), near-term demand is largely covered; ordering now would only arrive later and create unnecessary holding cost.",
