With L=4 we must cover L+1=5 weeks of demand: 5\xd730\u2248150 units. Current coverage: on-hand 85 + in-transit 70 = 155 units, which marginally exceeds the 5-week requirement. Given holding cost = $1/unit/period and sufficient pipeline to meet expected demand, avoid additional ordering to reduce holding cost and risk of excess inventory. Place no order this period.",
