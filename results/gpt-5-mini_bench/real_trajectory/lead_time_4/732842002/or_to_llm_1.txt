Given high profit/low holding cost (profit=$19, holding=$1 \u2192 critical fractile ~0.95), we favor higher service and thus fill the shortfall now rather than risk large lost sales over multiple periods while waiting for uncertain arrivals. 5) Final action: order 446 units to bring pipeline+order up to approximately the 5-period coverage target (~720). 6) Carry-over insight: No new sustained signal (too few concluded arrivals to confirm lead-time change or lost shipments), so none recorded.",
