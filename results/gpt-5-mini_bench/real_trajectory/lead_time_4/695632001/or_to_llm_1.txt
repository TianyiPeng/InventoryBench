Recent weeks show elevated but volatile holiday demand (Period 42 spike=722, surrounding weeks 174\u2013216\u2013193). To balance high service needs for the holiday window against substantial existing pipeline (707 units) and avoid excessive holding cost after the peak, I scale OR's recommendation down slightly. Ordering 300 adds capacity to cover a potential elevated 4\u20135 period demand profile without overshooting given current pipeline; 300 keeps total committed inventory near 1007, roughly covering ~5 periods at ~200 units/week while limiting holding exposure if demand normalizes post-holiday.",

OR recommended 244 units based on historical baseline, but that would create excess inventory given confirmed lead time and large in-transit.
