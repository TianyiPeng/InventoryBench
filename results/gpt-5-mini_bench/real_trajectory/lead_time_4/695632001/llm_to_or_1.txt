Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [172,178,181,109,165], mean=161. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals observed so no evidence of lead-time change or lost shipments. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample, ensuring coverage for the review+lead period while avoiding unsupported manual adjustments.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=210 (ordered in P1) and no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unconfirmed. Historical weekly demand samples (172,178,181,109,165) give mean=161.0. Use promised lead time and default demand/statistics to let OR backend compute base-stock and cap with full historical mean/variance; this is conservative given missing arrival confirmation and limits stockout risk for the next (L+1)=5 periods while avoiding speculative explicit adjustments.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly samples mean=161.0 (5 samples). Promised lead time=4. On-hand=0, in-transit=414; pipeline (414) < expected (1+L)*mean = 5*161=805 so inventory likely insufficient across review+lead. Orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 have not concluded but promised L=4 means arrivals are not yet expected. No sustained changepoint or lead-time evidence to override promised values. Use default statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock and caps using full sample history.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04): on-hand=0, in-transit=625 (sum of P1-3 orders). No concluded arrivals yet so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised 4. Recent concluded demands (P1-3) avg\u2248164, historical sample mean=161. Profit/holding implies high critical fractile (19/(19+1)=0.95) so maintain default lead time and demand estimates. Using default methods lets the OR engine compute base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and std over all samples, which balances high service level against holding cost given current large in-transit pipeline.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical weekly demand samples avg=161 units; promised lead time=4. On-hand=0, in-transit=832 (sum of prior orders). All prior period concludes show arrived=0 but with promised L=4 these orders are scheduled to arrive during this current period and will only be confirmed in the Period 6 conclude\u2014so no evidence of lost shipments or lead-time change yet. Pipeline (832) roughly matches expected (1+L)*mean = 5*161=805, so use default lead time and default demand stats to let the OR backend compute base stock and cap while respecting the large in-transit pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2130.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized demand (Periods1-5): [143,194,156,145,117] \u2014 no sustained upward regime; demand near historical mean with one lower week. On-hand=93, in-transit=686 (large pipeline). Period 5 conclude shows arrival of Period1 order (arrived=210, lead_time=4) confirming promised lead time. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=4). With stable demand samples and a large pipeline, use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)*sample mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, avoiding overreaction to the single low week while letting the backend cap orders given pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2063.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): demand context uses historical weekly samples (mean=161). On-hand=179, in-transit=585 (no new missing arrivals in concluded history). Lead time has been observed as 4 periods (Periods 1\u21925, 2\u21926). I choose L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding overreacting to short-run noise.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=285, in-transit=479 (total pipeline=764). Historical weekly mean=161 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). Lead time was confirmed as 4 periods in history, pipeline currently slightly below (1+L)*mean = 5*161=805 expected demand over review+lead window, so keep lead time and demand estimates conservative using defaults. I choose default L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses promised lead time (4) and full-sample demand stats to compute base stock and capped order\u2014this balances service level with holding cost given profit $19 vs holding $1.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concluded history shows stable weekly demand (historical samples mean=161) and confirmed lead time = 4 periods (arrival pattern P1\u2192P5 etc.). Current on-hand=289 and in-transit=364, so pipeline+on-hand is ample vs. expected demand. Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep forecasting simple and robust: L set to default (promised 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, leveraging the stable historical mean while letting the backend apply the service-level cap. This balances service (profit $19 vs hold $1) without overreacting to short-term noise or delayed shipments.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=218, in-transit=507. Historical conclude messages show orders placed in P1\u2013P5 arriving after 4 periods (arrived in P5\u2013P9), confirming actual lead time = 4. No sustained demand regime shift detected (recent demands vary but not systematically). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed LT=4. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the supplied samples) because the original sample series (2019-01 dates) is the primary demand seed and there is no strong sustained change; this keeps the OR engine's high service-level bias (profit/holding => q=19/20=0.95) while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise. These choices ensure pipeline + on-hand targeting covers the (L+1) periods of demand and respect the backend capped ordering policy.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (arrivals from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). On-hand=239, in-transit=555 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=794, which is near the (1+L)-period demand implied by historical samples (mean weekly demand \u2248161, (1+L)=5 \u2192 target \u2248805). No sustained demand regime change detected. Use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance and preserves service-level while avoiding ad hoc adjustments given consistent arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1576.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=248, in-transit=522; pipeline+on-hand comfortably covers several weeks but recent weekly demand has softened versus the Jan baseline. Lead time confirmed as 4 in prior concludes (sustained observation). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed value. Demand: recent 7 concluded weeks (Periods 5-11) show mean \u2248122/week vs historical sample mean 161/week \u2192 I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat to reflect the lower recent regime and avoid over-ordering. I also use recent_N (N=7) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce holding cost risk while maintaining service given full pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=219, in-transit=430. Historical demand samples (seed) show mean ~161/week and no recent sustained shift in demand; lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods and shipments have subsequently arrived on that cadence. No evidence of lost shipments in recent concluded periods. To keep the OR engine aligned with the promised/observed lead time and stable historical demand, use default methods so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (using established demand stats) against holding cost given current ample pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Current on-hand=322, in-transit=419 (total pipeline=741). Historical observed lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed in concludes). Demand history (Jan samples mean=161) and recent weekly demands (~80\u2013203) show no sustained regime shift. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This keeps target base-stock aligned with historical mean demand while the large pipeline provides coverage against variability and the 4-period lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=360, in-transit=361 (total pipeline+on-hand=721). Historical weekly samples mean=161 (5 samples); prior conclude messages confirm actual lead time=4 periods. I use L=default (promised=4) and default demand estimates (mu_hat and sigma_hat) so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps forecasts grounded in full-sample history while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time; pipeline coverage (721) is slightly below (1+L)*mean (805), so backend will order to restore target service level while capping order size per policy to control holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1-P11 all arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=351 and in-transit=393 (pipeline+on-hand ample vs recent weekly demand ~100-200). No sustained demand regime change detected in recent periods. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period reality, and use default demand/volatility (backend (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of samples) so the OR engine builds base-stock from the full-sample demand estimate while accounting for the 5-period exposure (review+lead). This balances service (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given ample on-hand/pipeline and steady demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1\u2192arrived P5 through P11\u2192arrived P15). On-hand=277 + in-transit=465 gives ample pipeline coverage; last conclude (P16) showed arrived=0 for the most recent order but this fits the 4-period arrival pattern (it would arrive during P17 and be visible in P18). I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and set L=default so the OR engine uses L=4. Demand history is limited and stable vs baseline samples, so I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This keeps the base-stock tied to full-sample estimates while the OR engine applies service-level tradeoffs given profit $19 and holding $1.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed repeatedly: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, etc.)

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; no missing shipments visible. On-hand=406, in-transit=334 => pipeline+on-hand comfortably covers multiple weeks of demand. Historical sample mean=161 (weekly). I keep L=default (promised 4) because concluded history matches promise. I choose mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples, giving the OR engine a stable 5-week demand forecast anchored to historical data. I choose sigma_hat=default so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples) for variability; conservative variance preserves service while respecting holding cost (profit/holding favors service but current inventory is ample). No explicit adjustments needed given strong on-hand+pipeline and consistent lead-time evidence.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concluded history shows stable weekly demand around ~100-200 with no sustained regime change; lead time repeatedly observed = 4. Current on-hand=451 and in-transit=299 (healthy pipeline). I select default lead time (use promised 4) and default demand moments so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This conservative choice leverages full-sample estimates to keep service high given ample inventory and confirmed 4-period lead time, while the backend cap will limit overly large single-period orders.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent concluded history firmly confirms actual lead time = 4 periods. Historical weekly demand (samples provided) has mean ~161 units/week; on-hand=501 + in-transit=235 => pipeline=736 units. (L+1)=5 implies expected demand over review+lead \u2248805 units, so pipeline is slightly short of cover. I select default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical mean/variance across all samples to compute base_stock and the capped order. This is conservative given the confirmed 4-period LT and limited recent demand shift evidence\u2014lets backend increase order if needed while respecting cap to limit holding cost exposure.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand history shows weekly demand in the ~50\u2013200 range with historical sample mean 161 (samples from Jan\u2013Feb). On-hand=515, in-transit=208 \u2014 ample coverage vs. typical weekly demand; no evidence of lost shipments (arrivals consistently show 4-period lead time). Use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples, letting the optimizer balance service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) automatically.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=495, in-transit=191 => pipeline+on-hand=686 vs. (1+L)*mean \u2248805, so current inventory is slightly below the default coverage for (L+1) periods. Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4; therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies its base-stock calculation consistently with observed history and promised lead time.

Historical weekly samples (172,178,181,109,165) give mean\u2248161 and moderate variability; recent concluded history consistently shows lead time = 4. I therefore use the default lead time (promised 4, confirmed by concluded arrivals) and default demand/statistics calculations ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This leverages the stable historical sample set, avoids overfitting to short-term noise, and lets the OR backend compute the base-stock and cap appropriately to balance profit vs. holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). Historical concluded arrivals consistently confirm actual lead time = 4. Current on-hand=444, in-transit=280 (total pipeline=724). Historical sample mean demand = 161 (samples: 172,178,181,109,165). I use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This keeps parameterization aligned with long-run historical demand and the confirmed 4-period lead time; given pipeline (724) < default base_stock target (~805), the backend will order to refill toward that target while capping order size to limit overstock/higher holding costs.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=434, in-transit=250 (pipeline total=684) which comfortably covers several weeks of recent demand (~80\u2013130/week historically). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments. I therefore use default lead time and default demand stats so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set. This prioritizes using long-run demand estimates to balance the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost while avoiding overreaction to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=421, in-transit=223. Historical concluded arrivals consistently confirm actual lead time = 4. Profit/holding implies very high target service level (q=19/(19+1)=0.95). Demand history (samples provided) shows no sustained recent regime shift. I therefore keep promised lead time and use default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock using all samples (conservative high service level) while the capped policy will limit excessive ordering and control holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent weekly demand ~80\u2013130 (recent weeks: 107,90,58,25,66,103,85,58,74,67,48,54,58,85,103,66,25,58,90,107).

Given confirmed LT=4 and ample pipeline, use default estimators so backend uses full-sample mean/SD scaled by (1+L); this balances service level with low holding cost while letting OR engine compute appropriate safety stock.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows stable weekly demand (historical samples mean=161) and multiple concluded arrivals confirming actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=402, in-transit=255 (healthy pipeline). To avoid overreacting to routine arrival variability and because lead time is confirmed, use default settings so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples. This balances service (use 5-period coverage) against holding cost given high on-hand stock and modest holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=354, in-transit=297 (total pipeline=651) which comfortably covers several weeks of demand at recent demand levels. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments. I select L=default to keep promised lead time (4) since observed data matches promise. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use default (all-samples) to let the OR backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the provided demand samples; this is conservative given stable demand history and avoids overfitting to short-term noise. These settings keep base stock tied to historical demand while the capped ordering rule will limit order size to control holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent weekly demand has ranged high (several weeks ~140\u2013181) but historical samples (Jan) mean ~161. On-hand=89 + in-transit=452 gives pipeline 541 units, which with L=4 covers ~ (1+L)=5 periods at an average ~161/week (5\xd7161\u2248805) partially funded by existing pipeline; no shipments appear missing and multiple conclude messages confirm lead time=4 in prior periods. Therefore use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base stock from all-sample mean/variance, balancing service level (profit/holding tradeoff) while avoiding ad-hoc downweighting of history.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 33 shows a single extreme demand spike (451) but it is not a sustained regime shift (only one period), so do NOT alter demand estimates yet. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (matches observed 4). For demand I select mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std)\u2014this avoids overreacting to the single-week spike while the sizable in-transit inventory (583) already provides coverage.

On-hand=0, in-transit=759 \u2014 large pipeline present (covers multi-period demand). Promised lead time remains 4 and recent concluded history confirms L=4 repeatedly, so use default promised L. To capture the recent higher demand regime and reduce stockout risk, set mu_hat using recent_N=5 (focus on last 5 observed demands). Use sigma_hat recent_N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias base-stock up to cover the observed spike while the large in-transit quantity limits immediate additional ordering and holding cost exposure.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=1199. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history (Periods 5,6,7,...,37), so use promised/observed L=4. Recent weeks (Periods 31\u201337) show a clear upward demand regime vs. earlier baseline (several large demands: 181,180,451,264,177,191,250) \u2014 I target the most recent regime to avoid understocking into the current high-demand run. I therefore forecast demand using a recent_N window to capture the surge dynamics (N=8 chosen to cover the last two months of weekly demand while respecting the N selection rule). I also estimate volatility from the same recent window so service-level sizing reflects current variability. These choices increase the base-stock to protect against stockouts during the elevated demand while the OR backend uses profit/holding to set safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=1268. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Large pipeline already covers multiple weeks of demand; to avoid excess holding while preserving service level, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the backend computes base_stock from full-sample statistics.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=1129 \u2014 substantial pipeline likely covers multiple periods of demand. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ...). Demand shows recent spikes (Periods 33-38) but pipeline is large; to avoid excess holding while keeping service, use promised lead time and default demand estimates so OR backend applies its base-stock/calibration using full historical samples. Selected L=default to reflect confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples given the large in-transit stock and no new sustained regime change requiring manual override.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods across concluded history (stable). Current position: on-hand=317, in-transit=684 \u2014 ample pipeline. No new missing-shipment signal. To keep the OR engine aligned with the confirmed promised lead time and long historical demand samples, I select default settings so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to recent volatility while the large pipeline limits stockout risk; it also reduces unnecessary extra ordering that would raise holding costs.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Demand context: recent history shows volatile weekly demand with several large spikes but no persistent new regime; confirmed lead time=4 in concluded history. Current inventory: on-hand=517, in-transit=310 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=827 which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of recent average demand. I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (backed by repeated conclude evidence). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all samples; this balances service level (using full-sample demand estimate) against holding cost given already-high on-hand + in-transit inventory and stable confirmed lead time.

Daily Reward (R_t): $13613.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a very large one-week demand spike (Period 42 demand=722) but this appears isolated versus the longer history. Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in prior conclude messages. Current on-hand=105 and in-transit=130 (total pipeline=235), which is well below what a 5-period demand forecast would require if demand is near historical averages. I select default lead time so the OR engine uses the promised L=4, and default mu_hat/sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)-period mean and volatility from the full sample set; this lets the OR engine raise base stock automatically in response to the backend's full-sample estimate while avoiding overfitting to a single large spike.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple conclude messages). Current inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=465 units (no arrivals visible yet). Week 42 saw a one-off extreme demand spike (722) but this is not a sustained regime shift across 3+ periods; overall historical samples remain the best estimator. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all historical samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the base-stock safety buffer calibrated to long-run variability while avoiding overreacting to a single holiday spike. Defaults also leverage the backend cap which limits overly large single orders and balances service level vs. holding cost given profit/holding (q\u22480.95).

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=799. Recent weeks show volatile/high spikes (e.g. Period 42 demand=722; Periods 43\u201344 demand=177,216) so pipeline is critical. I use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility; this lets the optimizer trade service level vs holding cost using full-data estimates while respecting the confirmed lead time and current large in-transit position.

Recent high demand spikes (e.g. Periods 32\u201342) and several large recent orders mean pipeline is sizable; no clear new demand regime shift. I use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history, letting the solver balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Recent demand shows a short-lived large spike at Period 42 (722) followed by elevated but variable weekly demand (177,216,193,127). On-hand=3, in-transit=1033 (large pipeline). Promised lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use default L to match supplier promise. To reflect the most recent demand regime (last 5 weeks including the post-spike pattern) and avoid overreacting to the single huge outlier, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures weeks 42\u201346). This keeps the OR base-stock responsive to recent demand while the large in-transit position prevents aggressive additional ordering, balancing service level vs holding cost.
