Cost tradeoff: profit = holding cost, so holding excess is expensive, but stockouts for high recent demand are costlier (lost profit).

Recent demand has been elevated (avg \u2248350/week over P41\u2013P46) but holding cost equals profit ($1), so excess inventory directly reduces objective. OR recommends 0 and its cap/base-stock logic yields no order when pipeline is high.
