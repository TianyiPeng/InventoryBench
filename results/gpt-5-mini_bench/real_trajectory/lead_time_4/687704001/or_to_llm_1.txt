{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history (multiple P arrivals show 4-period lag). Inventory: on-hand=341 + in-transit=240 = 581 units. Recent demand (P43\u2013P46) averaged ~51/week \u2192 (L+1)=5-week demand \u2248 255 units. Pipeline + on-hand (581) comfortably covers 5-week expected demand, so no replenishment is needed now. OR recommended 0 units (uses promised L and historical mean); given high holding cost equal to profit (holding=$1 = profit=$1) extra stock is costly and we already have ample coverage, I follow OR and order 0 to avoid unnecessary holding cost.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Following OR's 0 \u2014 on-hand+in-transit (581) > 5-week demand (~255) and lead time is confirmed at 4, so ordering would only add costly holding with little benefit.",
