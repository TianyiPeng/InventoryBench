Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows a sharp, sustained rise (weeks 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 = 56,216,319). No concluded arrivals in history so cannot infer lead time; use promised lead time. To capture the new higher regime, set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 3 samples (most recent stable changepoint) and align sigma_hat to recent volatility (recent_N, N=3). This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher demand while avoiding overstating variance from older zero-demand weeks.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 through 2019-02-04: recent mean of last 3 weeks = 197 units/week vs prior weeks near 0 (sustained for 3 periods).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand regime change confirmed (Periods covering 2019-01-21..2019-02-04: last 3 weeks mean \u2248197 vs prior \u22480). On-hand=0, in-transit=415 (ordered in P1) but no arrival yet in P1 conclude \u2014 insufficient evidence to change promised lead time. Use L=default to keep promised lead time. For demand, use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (weeks 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04). Use sigma recent_N (N=3) to reflect volatility in the new regime. These settings raise the base-stock to serve the sustained higher demand while sigma based on recent samples informs safety stock to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand regime confirmed: last 3 observed weeks (2019-01-21..2019-02-04) average \u2248197/week vs near 0 earlier; sustained for 3 periods so I use recent data. On-hand=0, in-transit=771 \u2014 with promised L=4 (default) the review+lead horizon is 5 weeks \u2192 required stock \u22485\xd7197=985 units, so pipeline is short; prior orders remain in-transit (no concluded arrivals yet) so I keep promised lead time and bias forecasts to recent regime. Choices: L default to keep promised lead time (no concluded arrivals to infer a different LT), mu_hat recent_N on the last 3 demand samples to capture the new regime, sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters push the OR engine to raise orders to cover the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding overstating uncertainty.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=1132; three consecutive concluded periods show sustained elevated demand (Period1=276, Period2=207, Period3=163). No concluded arrivals yet for placed orders, so no evidence to change promised lead time. I treat the demand shift as recent and use a recent_N=3 regime for demand estimates to reflect current higher mean and variability; keep L default to rely on promised lead time. This increases forecasted (1+L)-period demand to improve service level given high in-transit uncertainty while sigma uses same recent window to capture current volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift confirmed starting 2019-01-21: recent avg of last 3 concluded periods = 215.33 units/week (Periods 1-3: 276,207,163), sustained for 3+ periods and higher than prior near-zero levels.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand has clearly shifted from near-zero to ~200/week (sustained for 3+ periods). On-hand=0, in-transit=1132 which already covers multiple weeks of elevated demand. No concluded arrivals beyond Period4 (we cannot yet confirm actual lead time), so keep L at promised (default). For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher regime (uses the last 3 observed demands to avoid dilution by prior near-zero weeks). For sigma I also use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These settings prioritize service for the confirmed demand regime while leveraging the large in-transit pipeline to limit extra ordering and holding costs.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-99.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand regime: sustained elevated weekly demand since 2019-01-21 (historical concluded demands P1-P5 = 276,207,163,184,158). On-hand=257, in-transit=717 (includes arrival from P1 confirmed). Observed arrival pattern confirms actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192arrived P5). Choose L by 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (using last 5 concluded demand samples) so mu_hat reflects current elevated regime across the full review+lead horizon (1+L=5 weeks). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These settings prioritize meeting current sustained demand while limiting excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=484, in-transit=375 (total pipeline 859). Historical concluded lead times show consistent 4-period arrivals (P1->P5, P2->P6); demand regime shifted up starting 2019-01-21 and recent concluded demand shows a downward drift over latest weeks (Periods 4-6: 184,158,129). Set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times. Use mu_hat recent_N=3 and sigma_hat recent_N=3 to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent demand regime and capture the recent decline in weekly demand, limiting excess inventory while maintaining service given long lead time and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand regime (since 2019-01-21) is sustained; recent weekly demands (Periods 3-7) show a downward drift from initial spike. On-hand=676 with in-transit=14 provides large coverage (~3\u20134+ weeks of recent demand), so no aggressive replenishment signal is needed. I keep L at the promised lead time to align with confirmed historical lead-time behavior. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 5 demand observations (captures the current lower-demand regime and reduces overweighting of the early spike). This balances service (by accounting for recent demand) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): Recent weekly demand has settled from the earlier spike to a lower steady regime. Last 5 concluded demands (Periods 4-8): 184,158,129,169,193 (mean ~166.6). On-hand 483 + in-transit 127 = 610 units covers multiple weeks of demand; no evidence of new lost shipments. Lead time historically observed = 4 periods (confirmed P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). I set L by calculated historical lead times to reinforce the confirmed L=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the post-spike steady mean; sigma uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned to current run-rate while avoiding excess inventory given holding cost equals profit.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=379, in-transit=335. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P5\u2013P9) = [158,129,169,193,104], avg \u2248150.6/week, showing sustained nonzero regime since 2019-01-21. To focus the forecast on the current elevated regime and limit impact of earlier near-zero periods, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes demand and variability over the review+lead horizon based on the most recent 5 weeks. This balances service (capture current higher demand) versus holding cost by avoiding inflation from older zero-demand samples.

I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (4) which matches observed arrivals; for mu_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent downward shift (1+L multiplies the recent mean), and for sigma_hat I use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (cover next 5 periods of demand) while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals). Current inventory: on-hand=222, in-transit=360 -> pipeline=582. I choose L by calculation of observed lead times to confirm the known 4-period lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to recent drops; mu_hat thus reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 weeks. For volatility I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability. These settings keep base-stock sized to cover (L+1) weeks of the recent demand regime while avoiding excess holding given holding cost equals profit.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand stabilized well above prior near-zero regime; last 6 concluded weekly demands = [169,193,104,81,90,93], avg=121.67/wk. On-hand=242 + in-transit=247 => pipeline=489. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history (arrivals consistently 4 periods after order). I set L=default to use promised/confirmed lead time=4. I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current post-changepoint regime (N=6 is between 3 and 20 and uses the most recent stable periods). This yields a (1+L)-period demand forecast built on the recent mean and a volatility estimate from the same window, balancing service level vs holding cost while accounting for in-transit inventory and past delayed arrivals.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Observed lead times from concluded messages consistently show 4 periods (orders placed P1->arrived P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, etc.), so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand has settled from the earlier regime shift; current on-hand (384) + in-transit (159)=543 provides strong cover. To let the OR engine adapt to the most recent demand regime and volatility while acknowledging the 4-period lead, use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast weights the latest 5 demand observations and limits excess stock given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Current on-hand=364, in-transit=120. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirms). Demand regime increased starting 2019-01-21 and has been sustained (recent higher weekly sales). To reflect confirmed lead time I use calculated average of observed lead times. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility emphasize the recent elevated weeks. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by limiting the lookback to the recent regime rather than all historical near-zero weeks.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has fallen from the earlier spike; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [90,93,66,59,48], mean=71.2/week. On-hand 316 + in-transit 120 = 436 units which comfortably covers a 5-period demand forecast (1+L periods) using the recent mean (5*71.2=356). Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default for L. To adapt to the post-spike regime I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine reduces target stock relative to the earlier high-demand regime and avoids excess holding cost while keeping service.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent demand has declined from the Feb peak and stabilized at lower weekly levels. Last 6 concluded weekly demands (Periods 11-16): [90,93,66,59,48,34], mean=65 units/week. On-hand=282 + In-transit=120 => pipeline=402 units. Promised lead time is 4 and historical concludes consistently show lead_time=4. I choose L=default to use the promised (and confirmed) 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the recent lower regime (1+L=5 \u2192 (1+L)*mean_recent = 5*65 \u2248 325 expected demand over review+lead). Pipeline (402) exceeds that, so ordering should be conservative to avoid holding cost. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent demand volatility. These parameters lean toward preserving service while avoiding excess holding given current inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/10 (Period 18). On-hand=371, in-transit=0. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift: recent weeks (Periods 13-17) show low, stable demand (66,59,48,34,31). To avoid overstock while protecting service over the (1+L)=5-week coverage, set L to promised (default) and forecast using the recent 5-week regime: mu_hat uses recent_N N=5 (captures recent mean ~47.6/week \u2192 5\xb747.6\u2248238 units across review+lead), sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect the lower recent volatility. This reduces excess ordering relative to earlier high-demand regime while maintaining coverage for the confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has fallen substantially from the Jan\u2013Mar spike; last 5 concluded weekly demands = [59,48,34,31,22], recent mean \u2248 38.8. On-hand=349, in-transit=0 \u2014 inventory is ample relative to recent demand (covers ~9 weeks at recent rate). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; no lost shipments in recent history. I set L=default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current low-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 weeks and volatility of last 5 weeks). This reduces ordering relative to the earlier high-demand regime, limiting holding cost while still covering (L+1) periods of expected demand.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand decline confirmed: recent avg of last 5 concluded periods (Periods 14-18) = 38.8 units/week, down from the Jan\u2013Mar regime avg \u2248215 (+/-) \u2014 sustained for 5 periods (~82% decrease from spike).

Historical concludes repeatedly show orders arriving with a 4-period lag. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, set lead time to be inferred from observations (calculate). Forecast demand using the most recent 5 weeks to capture the new low-demand regime (mu_hat recent_N N=5) and set volatility from the same 5-week window (sigma_hat recent_N N=5). This reduces ordering to match the current lower demand and prevents further inventory build-up given large on-hand stock.

To avoid overstock given profit=holding= $1, use recent demand estimates: set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent low-demand window (N=9, Periods 14\u201322). This keeps target base-stock aligned with current low demand while preserving service with existing on-hand inventory.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Recent demand has declined and stabilized at low weekly levels since Period 19 (recent demands: P19\u2013P23 = 20,5,9,9,6). On-hand=300, in-transit=0; prior concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time history (consistently 4) rather than the promised default. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the recent downturn regime (recent average \u22489.8 units/week \xd7 (1+L) used by backend). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 so volatility reflects the lower, recent regime. These choices reduce forecasted demand and safety stock to avoid excess holding cost while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding stockouts given the new low-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=288, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Demand has been in a low regime since Period ~14; the most recent 5 concluded weeks (Periods 20-24) demand = [5,9,9,6,12], recent mean \u22488.2/wk. To avoid overstock (holding cost = profit), I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=5) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current low-demand regime. I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). These parameters reduce ordering toward current low demand while respecting observed lead time and limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand has returned to the low post-spike regime (Periods 21-25 demands = 9,9,6,12,58; recent mean \u224818.8). On-hand=230, in-transit=0; no overdue arrivals. Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods. To avoid overstock given holding cost = profit, I use a short-term recent demand estimate: set L to calculated average of observed lead times (matches confirmed 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand samples to capture the recent low-volatility regime (N=5), so the OR backend will target (1+L)\xd7recent mean and reduced uncertainty, preventing excessive replenishment.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=159, in-transit=0. Demand fell from the Jan\u2013May spike to a low regime (Periods 14\u201323 avg \u224838.8) but the last two weeks show an uptick (58,71) that is not yet a sustained regime change. Promised lead time was previously confirmed as 4, so use default L to keep the backend aligned with contract. To be responsive to the recent short-run increase while avoiding overreaction to a 2-week blip, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (last 5 demand samples) so the OR backend targets inventory for the near-term observed demand pattern and lets the cap limit excessive replenishment given holding cost = profit.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=58, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead time; recent demand has risen over the last 5 periods (Periods 23\u201327 = 6,12,58,71,101). To react to the recent uptick while the backend uses promised L=4 for cap calculations, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirming 4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the newest regime and short-term volatility so the OR engine targets higher service with limited holding risk given current low pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Recent demand uptick starting Period 23: avg of last 5 concluded periods = 49.6 units/week vs prior recent avg 38.8 (+28%).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent regime: demand uptick beginning Period 23; last 6 concluded weekly demands (Periods 23-28) = [6,12,58,71,101,74], avg \u224853.67. On-hand=0, in-transit=116 (ordered Period 28, not yet concluded). Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; use promised lead time to keep OR engine aligned with supplier promise. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new higher-demand regime (5-period review+lead horizon), letting the backend scale base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the recent mean while reflecting recent volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts during uptick) against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has risen since Period 23; last 7 concluded demands (P23-P29) show higher activity and last 3 weeks (P27-P29) average ~91.7. On-hand=0, in-transit=232 which provides partial cover but (1+L) periods of demand should be secured. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods (observed arrivals P5\u2013P17); no new evidence to change. I choose L=default to use promised lead time, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to focus the forecast/volatility on the recent uptick regime (captures most recent demand pattern while limiting noise). This balances service (capture rising demand) against holding costs given substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand increased over the last 3 concluded weeks (P28-30: demand = 74, 100, 157) after a mid-year trough; mean of last 3 = 110.33. On-hand=0, in-transit=344 (orders from P28-30: 116+116+112), no overdue/concluded shortages\u2014lead time has been consistently 4 in concluded history. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual LT=4; I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 3-week regime (recent_N N=3) to capture the current uptick and recent volatility so the OR backend sizes base-stock to meet (1+L) demand under the new regime while limiting holding cost given high holding=$1 and profit=$1.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead time. To balance service vs holding cost I set L to be inferred from observations, and forecast demand using the most recent 5 concluded weeks to capture the current uptick. Using recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine size base stock for the current higher regime while using recent volatility for safety; pipeline (in-transit) will be offset against that target.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=522 (matches orders from P30-P33). Historical concluded lead times show consistent 4-period arrivals (orders from P1,P2,P3,P6,P8,P9,P10,P13,P28,P29 all arrived after 4 periods) \u2014 use calculated average lead time. Recent demand has risen sharply in the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 29-33: 100,157,161,146,342) so I use a recent-5 demand estimate for mean and volatility to capture the current higher-demand regime while limiting influence from older low-demand periods. These parameters aim to raise the base stock to meet elevated near-term demand while the OR backend cap limits excessive orders given uncertainty.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=745. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has shifted up sharply since Period 29 (large weekly sales: 100,157,161,146,342,214); to capture this new regime I use a recent window over the last 6 concluded demand samples to set demand forecast and volatility. Using 'calculate' for L ensures the backend uses the observed lead-time average (4). The recent_N choice for mu_hat/sigma_hat biases orders toward the current high-demand regime and prevents understocking given long lead time and substantial in-transit that may still miss demand if treated as stale.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=0, in-transit=753. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Recent demand has shifted from the low summer regime to a stronger level since Period 31; last 5 concluded demands (P31-P35) average \u2248210.6/wk. To balance service vs holding given profit=holding, I use calculated L (avg observed), and recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets stock for the most recent regime while reflecting recent volatility.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21): recent demand has re-emerged into a high regime. Last 5 concluded demands (Periods 32-36) = [146,342,214,190,184], avg \u2248215.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=985 (no overdue/lost shipments visible; historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4). I choose L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=recent_N N=5 to focus the forecast on the new high-demand regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N N=5 to capture recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to stock for the observed high demand while using recent variability to balance service vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 32: avg of last 5 concluded periods (P32-36)=215.2 units/week vs prior recent avg 49.6 (+~335%), sustained for 5 periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has returned to the high regime that began at Period 32: concluded demands for Periods 33-37 = [342,214,190,184,213], recent mean \u2248 228.6 units/week. Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. On-hand=0, in-transit=915 \u2014 (1+L)=5 period coverage -> recent 5-period demand forecast = 5\xd7228.6\u22481143 units, so pipeline is short (~228 units). To drive the OR engine to replenish for the renewed high-demand regime I set L=default (use promised 4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed high regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters align the base-stock to the observed high mean while sigma reflects recent variability so the capped order logic will order additional units to cover the shortfall but avoid excessive overstock given holding cost=profit.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent history shows the higher-demand regime that began around Period 32 has persisted through Period 38 (recent demands: 146,342,214,190,184,213,192 \u2014 sustained high mean \u2248217). All observed arrivals that concluded show lead time = 4. On-hand=143, in-transit=808. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded lead-time evidence matches promised. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime (stable over the last 5+ periods) and reduce influence of earlier low-demand periods. Sigma is also recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR backend to stock for the current regime while avoiding over-weighting older low-demand data.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand regime (higher-demand regime starting ~Period 32) remains in effect: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 35-39) = [190,184,213,192,124], recent mean ~180.6/week. On-hand (208) + in-transit (661) is ample but demand remains elevated vs earlier low regime\u2014use a recent-N forecast to reflect current elevated but slightly variable demand and keep lead time at promised value. Chosen methods: L=default to use promised (confirmed) lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=5) to target the current high-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=5) to capture recent volatility and avoid under/over-stocking given holding cost equals profit.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed arrive after 4 periods). Recent demand regime since Period 32 is elevated: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 36-40) average = 168.4 units/week. On-hand 379 + in-transit 395 = 774 units, which covers ~4.6 weeks at the recent weekly rate. To match the confirmed lead time and recent high-demand regime I set L by observed lead times and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples (captures the current regime while keeping variability estimates local). This keeps the OR backend focused on meeting current weekly demand over the review+lead horizon (5 weeks) while avoiding excessive inventory from older low-demand periods.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has returned to the higher regime: last 5 concluded demands (P37-P41) = [213,192,124,129,109], avg=153.4/wk. On-hand=361, in-transit=372 \u2192 pipeline=733. With promised L=4 (review+lead =5 weeks), (1+L)*recent mean \u2248 767 units \u2014 pipeline is slightly below that, so replenish to cover the 5-week forecast. I set L=default to trust the promised 4-period lead (historically confirmed) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the current high-demand regime. This balances service (avoid stockouts given pipeline slightly short of 5-week demand) versus holding cost given already-large on-hand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent demand (Periods 38-42 concluded) averages ~156 units/week, reflecting the resumed high-demand regime that started around Period 32. On-hand=362 and in-transit=178 provide ample immediate coverage; we still set L to observed average (4) and forecast demand using the most recent 5 concluded weeks to capture the current regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand periods. sigma_hat uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility. These parameters aim to satisfy service while avoiding excess holding given $1 profit and $1 holding cost (balanced safety via recent volatility).

Demand has been volatile but recent concluded demands (Periods 39-43) show mixed high/low values; to be responsive I use a recent-window forecast. Choose L by calculating average observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most recent demand regime and volatility so the OR backend balances service vs holding given equal profit and holding cost.

On-hand 354 + in-transit 342 = 696 units covers multiple weeks (5-period coverage target). To reflect current short-term demand and recent volatility, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts based on the most recent regime while the backend cap will limit order size against pipeline.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods (many concluded arrivals from orders placed 4 periods earlier) so use calculated lead time. Recent demand is best represented by the last 5 concluded periods (Periods 41-45) where demand = [109,227,30,54,59], indicating a moderate recent average with notable variability. On-hand (363) + in-transit (274) = 637 units; with L\u22484 we must cover ~5 periods of demand. I set L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets inventory for the current reduced/volatile regime while accounting for recent variability and avoiding excess holding costs.

To capture the most recent regime while retaining responsiveness to recent volatility, set L by calculating observed lead times and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand based on the latest demand window.
