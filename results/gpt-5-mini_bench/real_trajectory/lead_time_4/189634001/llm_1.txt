Using lead-time evidence, these in-transit shipments will arrive across upcoming periods (P47:185 from P43, P48:185 from P44, P49:20 from P45, P50:220 from P46) and total 610, which already covers the ~5-week demand estimate. No overdue/ lost-order signals. Given substantial in-transit coverage and the holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($4/unit), placing additional orders risks excess holding cost with limited upside. Final action: place no new order this period.",
