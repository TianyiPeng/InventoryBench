Demand evidence: recent two periods show spikes (173,195) but not yet a sustained 3+ period shift vs. historical mean (~102). OR recommended 174 using promised L and historical demand; OR's base-stock logic implies ordering to bring pipeline toward ~526 units (base_stock) but applies a cap that yields a smaller single-period order. Given confirmed L=4 and large in-transit pipeline (371), we should not increase orders to chase the two-period spike. I follow the OR cap reasoning and choose a conservative capped order to avoid excess holding cost: order = 115 units. This reduces OR's 174 to 115 because pipeline already covers much of the 5-period (L+1) demand forecast and we lack 3+ periods of sustained higher demand to justify extra safety stock.
