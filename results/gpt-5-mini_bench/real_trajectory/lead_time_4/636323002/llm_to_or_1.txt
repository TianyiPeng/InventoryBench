Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. History shows low demand in early Jan (1,3) then a sustained higher regime for the last 3 weeks (27,17,34). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, and no concluded arrivals \u2192 no observed lead-time deviations, so keep promised lead time. To focus the forecast on the new high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (captures the 3-week elevated pattern); keep L=default so backend uses promised lead time. This balances service (capture recent spike) against holding cost by not inflating lead-time assumptions without evidence.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift detected: Periods 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04 avg=26 vs earlier 2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14 avg=2 (increase +24 units, +1200%), sustained for 3 periods.

On-hand=0, in-transit=41 (from Period1 order) which is insufficient vs expected demand over review+lead. Use promised lead time (default=4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=3 to capture the confirmed high-demand regime (1+L scaling handled by backend). Use recent_N N=3 for sigma to reflect recent volatility.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent demand regime is higher: historical samples show a sustained jump (weeks 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 avg=26 vs prior avg=2). On-hand=0, in-transit=95, recent demand has been volatile but clearly elevated. No concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in P1/P2 (possible delays), but insufficient evidence to change lead time\u2014stick with promised lead time. Set L=default to let backend assume promised 4 periods. For demand, use recent_N (N=3) to focus the forecast on the elevated regime (captures samples 27,17,34 \u2192 mean\u224826; backend will scale by 1+L). Use sigma recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to cover the higher recent mean while keeping lead-time assumption conservative given missing conclude evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand has shifted higher (recent demands: 43, 179, 136). On-hand=0, in-transit=314 \u2014 pipeline substantial but arrivals not yet observed (no concluded arrivals). Promised lead time still plausible (no concluded arrivals beyond promised window), so keep L as default. To capture the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 3 samples (N=3) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility, raising target base-stock to reduce stockouts while cap prevents extreme orders.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent demand shows a sustained higher regime: last three samples 27,17,34 (avg=26). On-hand=0, in-transit=548 (many outstanding orders); no concluded arrivals yet so do not infer lead-time change. Use promised lead time (default). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3-demand regime to reflect the sustained higher mean/vol and prioritize service while limiting excess holding.

Daily Reward (R_t): $134.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand has been elevated across the last 5 periods (demands: 43,179,136,67,35) versus earlier low levels; a sustained high-demand regime is in effect. Observed concluded arrival shows one order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time=4), matching the promised LT. On-hand=6, in-transit=702 (large pipeline) so orders should target demand forecast not immediate refill. I set L by averaging observed lead times to confirm actual LT=4 (method: calculate). For demand I use recent_N over the last 5 samples to capture the current high-demand regime for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5). This raises the base_stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher recent mean while sigma_hat recent_N captures volatility; together they balance service level (avoid stockouts given large recent demand) against holding cost (we note large in-transit pipeline so orders will be capped by OR engine).

Daily Reward (R_t): $200.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent observed arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1->arrived Period5; Period2->arrived Period6). On-hand=8, in-transit=648 -> pipeline large (656 total) so risk of excess holding if we overforecast. Recent demand (Periods 4-6 = 67,35,52) appears to reflect the new higher regime vs earlier tiny values. I set L by calculation to use observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N with N=3 (last 3 periods) to capture the current regime mean and avoid being pulled by early tiny samples; mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(last 3). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep replenishment responsive to confirmed lead time and recent demand while preventing oversized orders given large in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (orders: P1 arrived P5; P2 arrived P6).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-22.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand regime is elevated and sustained (carry-over noted: Jan21\u2013Feb04 avg jumped). Current inventory: on-hand=186, in-transit=429 (large pipeline). Recent concluded demands (Periods 5-7) = 35, 52, 41 \u2014 consistent higher demand. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior conclude messages. To keep service high (profit/holding \u2192 q=0.8) while avoiding excess stock given large pipeline, use promised/confirmed lead time and base forecasts on the most recent regime. Set L=default to use promised 4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (Periods 5-7) to capture current elevated mean and volatility and avoid dilution from older low-demand data. This biases ordering toward matching the recent higher demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering pressure.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent realized demand elevated and volatile: last 4 concluded demands = {P5:35, P6:52, P7:41, P8:99}, avg=56.75. On-hand=321, in-transit=195 -> ample pipeline but demand remains higher than long-run historical mean. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior conclude messages; use promised/default L to match backend. Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current higher-demand regime while avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples. This raises the base-stock target to maintain service given profit/holding tradeoff (profit=$4, holding=$1) while sigma estimated from the same recent window captures volatility for safety stock. No evidence of new lead-time shifts or lost shipments since last confirmations, so do not alter L explicitly.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15: recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4. On-hand is high (484) and in-transit = 0; recent realized weekly demand has been elevated versus the sparse 2019-Jan baseline. I set L by averaging observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime evident in the last several periods (periods with demands 35,52,41,99,32) so the OR engine targets a base-stock that reflects current demand and balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=461, in-transit=0; recent concluded periods show no overdue arrivals and actual lead time has been confirmed at 4 in prior history. Recent demand (Periods 5-10 = 35,52,41,99,32,23) averages ~47/week, noticeably higher than the very early samples. Use promised/default lead time to reflect confirmed L=4. For demand and volatility, use recent_N over the last 6 concluded demand observations to capture the current higher-demand regime and recent variability, so the OR base-stock and cap reflect current demand rather than the small early samples.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/29. Recent demand (Periods 6-11) shows a stabilized mean around ~45 units/week after earlier spike; on-hand=437, in-transit=0 so no incoming arrivals expected soon. Promised lead time is 4 and prior concludes confirm lead_time=4, so use promised lead time (default). To capture the recent regime (lower but variable demand) I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=6 (Periods 6-11) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, avoiding overweighting the early large spikes. This keeps base-stock sized to cover 5 periods of the current demand regime while avoiding excess holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$4.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand has settled at a higher regime (Periods 7-12 demands = 41,99,32,23,24,22; recent avg\u224840.17/week). On-hand=415, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample on-hand now but demand rate is ~40/wk. Promised lead time is 4 and prior confirms show actual L=4; use default lead time to keep backend aligned. To capture the recent higher demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 (uses last 6 demand samples, (1+L)-period aggregation) so the base-stock is sized to cover increased weekly demand while sigma reflects recent variability. This balances service level (avoid stockouts at ~40/wk) against holding cost given large on-hand stock.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. To avoid further excess holding given high on-hand, keep lead time estimate based on observed history and set demand forecast using the most recent 5 periods to reflect the downward trend.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent demand has fallen from the prior high regime; last 6 concluded weekly demands = [32,23,24,22,8,23], mean ~22. On-hand=384, in-transit=0 and no recent arrivals expected. Lead time has been observed as 4 in concluded history (stable). To avoid overstock while covering review+lead demand, set L by calculating observed lead times, and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using recent 6 weeks to capture the new lower-demand regime and reduced variability. This will reduce target base-stock versus using the earlier high-demand samples and prevent excess holding cost given profit=$4 vs holding=$1.

Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods; no new evidence of change. To avoid overstock while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (default) and estimate demand using the recent 6-week regime to reflect the lower recent mean and variance.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). On-hand=273, in-transit=0; no pending arrivals and recent demand has been variable with a large spike (93) in Period 16. Lead time has been confirmed historically as 4 periods; keep promised/default lead time. To balance service vs holding cost I bias demand forecast toward recent observations while smoothing noise: use an EWMA (gamma=0.3) for mu_hat so recent higher demands influence the base-stock but remain smoothed; use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility including the Period 16 spike. These choices keep orders responsive to recent demand spikes while avoiding overreaction given substantial on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=204 + in-transit=127 provides healthy coverage but demand has been volatile with recent higher weeks (Period 10-17 demands: 23,24,22,8,23,18,93,69). Previously confirmed lead time=4. Use promised lead time to remain consistent with observed arrivals. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=8 to capture the current post-change demand level and volatility (recent mean \u224835/week \u2192 (1+L)*mean used by backend). This balances service (capturing recent spikes) against holding cost given large existing inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Current on-hand=152, in-transit=127 (total pipeline 279). Recent weekly demand (history) shows a sustained higher regime established in late Jan\u2013Feb; lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior periods. Inventory + pipeline comfortably covers multiple weeks; to avoid excess holding cost I will use the promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/STD. No signs of new sustained changepoints or lost shipments requiring deviation.

Period 20 (2019-06-24). Current on-hand=84, in-transit=169. Recent demand has averaged higher than early-series lows with volatility from intermittent spikes (last 5 demands: 18,93,69,52,68; mean=60). Lead time has been confirmed historically as 4 periods; use promised/default L to keep OR engine alignment. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent regime (captures the recent spike and elevated mean), ensuring base_stock reflects current demand while sigma captures recent variability to avoid stockouts during spikes. No evidence of new lost shipments or lead-time change since last confirmation; existing pipeline (169) plus on-hand provides coverage but recent forecast keeps replenishment conservative to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Promised lead time=4 and past concludes confirm LT=4; use default L to keep backend aligned. Pipeline (251) < expected (1+L)*recent mean \u2248 5*84=420, so forecast using recent regime to react to higher recent demand while sigma uses same recent window to capture volatility.

Recent demand is volatile with several large spikes (periods 16,20,21,22) so I base forecasts on the most recent 20 demand observations to capture current regime and variability. Using L=calculate locks in the observed lead time while mu_hat and sigma_hat recent_N (N=20) let the OR engine compute (1+L)-period demand mean and scaled std from the recent window, balancing service (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding cost sensitivity.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has been elevated (Periods 16,20,21,22,23 show large spikes; last 5 concluded demands: 93,69,68,99,132,97,126 \u2014 recent high variability and elevated mean). To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default L=4) and set demand estimates using recent data (N=5) so the OR backend targets stock for the current higher-demand regime; apply recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This balances profit ($4) vs holding ($1) by focusing replenishment on the current high-demand cluster and letting the capped order cap limit over-ordering relative to pipeline (we already have substantial in-transit 346 units).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=26, in-transit=393 \u2014 ample pipeline but recent demand elevated (recent 5-week mean \u2248105.6). Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. To keep orders responsive to the current high-demand regime while avoiding excess holding cost, I use the promised/confirmed lead time and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 weeks (captures current regime). Volatility also estimated from the same 5-week window so the OR engine sizes safety stock to recent variability.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/5 (Period 26). Current on-hand=45, in-transit=429 (ample pipeline). Historical conclude messages show consistent arrivals with lead_time=4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P17\u2192P21, P19\u2192P23, P20\u2192P24, P21\u2192P25) \u2014 confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent realized demand (last 10 selling periods: P16\u2013P25 = 93,69,52,68,99,132,97,126,74,90) indicates a higher, sustained demand regime; use a recent-window forecast to capture current mean/volatility. Therefore set L by calculating average observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=10 so the backend bases base-stock on the current high-demand regime while recognizing large pipeline reduces urgent ordering.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has stabilized at a higher regime vs early samples: last five concluded demands = {97,126,74,90,94} (mean ~96.2). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. On-hand=88, in-transit=316 (pipeline ample). To match the observed regime and keep service while limiting holding cost, use promised/observed lead time and base-stock sizing driven by the recent 5-week mean. Chosen methods: L uses promised/confirmed lead time; mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture current elevated demand; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to current demand and avoids overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). On-hand=9, in-transit=429. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods consistently (orders in P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (Periods 24-27: 74,90,94,79; include P23=126 if needed) shows a higher sustained level vs early samples \u2014 use recent_N=5 to capture current regime for both mean and volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the present elevated demand while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples; it balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1, q=0.8) and holding cost risk given large in-transit volume.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent stable demand regime (captures current weekly mean \u224899 and variability), then let the OR backend compute base_stock balancing profit ($4) vs holding ($1).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent demand has stabilized around ~80\u2013100 units/week over the last several periods (Periods 22\u201329), while on-hand=119 and in-transit=335 provide ample coverage. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages, so use promised/default lead time. To size demand across review+lead, use a recent_N demand estimate focusing on the latest regime to avoid overreacting to early-year spike; selected N=8 to cover the most recent two months of weekly demand (captures recent mean ~80\u2013100). Keep sigma_hat as default to let the backend compute volatility from full history. These settings reduce new ordering given large pipeline inventory while preserving service level through a recent demand-based mu_hat and standard volatility estimate.

Recent 10-week demand (Periods 22-31) average=83.6; demand appears stable without new sustained changepoint. Historical conclues consistently show lead time = 4. I set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the current demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 5\xd783.6 \u2248 418 forecast across review+lead). Using recent_N keeps the base-stock responsive to the current observed mean/volatility, avoiding overweighting old low-demand samples while ensuring pipeline + on-hand cover L+1 periods of demand and balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Lead time has been empirically confirmed as 4 periods (consistent arrivals P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=190, in-transit=239 \u2014 pipeline covers many future periods so avoid large additional orders. Recent demand has moderated from earlier spike; last 5 observed weekly demands = [102, 80, 57, 37, 36], indicating a recent mean \u224862.4. I set L to default (promised 4) to reflect confirmed lead time but let mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility. This keeps the base-stock tuned to current demand while preventing excessive overstock given substantial pipeline inventory.

Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the sustained higher recent demand regime (last 8 observed weekly demands) so the OR engine targets a higher base-stock while keeping variability estimate current and avoiding excess during older low-demand weeks.

Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so set L by calculating observed lead time average. Recent demand (last several weeks) is moderate and stable vs earlier regime shift; to capture current demand level and recent variability, use recent_N with N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (focuses forecast on most recent 5 demand observations). This balances service (use recent demand to avoid overstock from earlier high regime) against holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent weekly demand has been moderate (typically 30\u2013100) after the early-year regime shift; historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. On-hand 306 + in-transit 13 = 319 provides substantial cover vs expected (1+L) demand. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent 20 weeks (captures current regime and reduces weight of early-year outliers), which helps the OR backend balance service level and holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent weeks show steady moderate weekly demand (last ~10 weeks demand values mostly 24\u201340 with occasional spikes). Current inventory (on-hand 295 + in-transit 111 = 406) is well above short-term expected demand. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; use promised lead time. To keep orders conservative and responsive to recent regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the most recent 8 demand periods to capture current mean/volatility while avoiding older regime noise. This reduces unnecessary holding cost while preserving service for short-term demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=260, in-transit=111. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4. Recent demand (Periods 31-37 plus P30) average \u224837.4/wk; using recent_N=8 covers the latest regime (no evidence of new sustained shift). Choose L=default to keep promised 4-period assumption (confirmed historically). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=8 to reflect current weekly mean/volatility over the review+lead horizon and to avoid overweighting early low-demand samples. This balances service (maintain stock for ~5-week coverage) against holding costs given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/4 (Period 39). Recent weekly demand has been stable ~25\u201340 units (last 8 periods mean \u224833.4). On-hand=235, in-transit=111 provides ample cover, but to avoid stockouts given confirmed 4-period lead time and recent regime, I set L by observed lead times (calculate) and use recent_N=8 for demand mean/volatility so the OR base-stock reflects the current higher-demand regime (weights safety vs. holding cost). This keeps orders moderate while preserving service during the sustained higher-demand period.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=206, in-transit=111. Promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time=4 (evidence in carry-over). Recent demand has been moderate (weekly demands mostly 20\u2013100) after the early 2019 regime shift; inventory + pipeline provides substantial cover. To let the OR engine use full historical demand statistics and the confirmed L=4, I choose default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (using confirmed lead time) vs holding cost without overfitting short-term noise or transient gaps.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). On-hand=293, in-transit=42 (pipeline=335) \u2014 ample cover vs typical weekly demand (~30s). Recent history confirms actual lead time=4 (observed consistently). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, keep promised lead time (default). Use a recent_N demand estimate (N=20) to capture the sustained post-regime demand pattern while de-emphasizing early small-sample weeks. Keep sigma as default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by review+lead. This yields conservative ordering (likely zero) given large current pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent weekly demand (last 7 concluded periods 35\u201341) averages ~30.6 units/week; inventory on-hand=262 + in-transit=95 => 357 units, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods of recent demand (~153 units). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods historically. To keep service while avoiding excess holding cost, use promised lead time and base demand estimates from the most recent 7 weeks so the OR engine sizes orders to recent demand patterns and reduces overstock risk.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand has been moderate (last 7 concluded demands: 24,35,25,29,24,31,62; mean\u224833) and historical observed lead times are consistently 4 periods. On-hand=200 + in-transit=95 gives good short-term coverage but we must replenish for the 1+L review+lead window. Set L by averaging observed lead times to lock in confirmed L=4. Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the forecast and volatility reflect the latest demand regime (captures the recent spike 62 while smoothing older extremes), letting the OR backend compute base stock vs holding tradeoff using profit/holding costs.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. On-hand=176, in-transit=95 (pipeline=271) with promised L=4 and prior confirmed actual L=4. Recent demand (Periods 39-43) = [29,24,24,62,24], recent mean \u224832.6; pipeline already covers multiple periods so we avoid inflating demand forecast. Set L by calculation to reflect observed lead-time history. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime and reduce influence of older high-variance early periods. This balances service (maintain coverage) versus holding cost given current healthy inventory/pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (last several months) centers around ~24\u201336 units/week with occasional spikes (e.g., 62 in P42). No new sustained regime shift since early-period increase. To keep the OR base-stock responsive to recent patterns while smoothing older volatility, I use recent_N=20 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures ~20 most recent demand samples). This balances service (capture recent demand level) versus holding cost given current healthy on-hand (203) + in-transit (53).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=235, in-transit=34. Profit/holding implies high service level (q=0.8) so keep conservative targets. Recent history shows stable arrivals with confirmed lead time=4 in prior periods; no new sustained demand or lead-time shifts observed. Use default lead time (promised 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical samples, which balances the high service target against holding cost given current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/30. Recent weekly demand has been modest (last 5 demands: 62,24,24,15,21,11 \u2014 recent 5-week avg \u224826), and total inventory (on-hand 224 + in-transit 106 = 330) comfortably covers multiple weeks (\u22485\u201312 weeks). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4. To avoid overreacting to recent noise while respecting confirmed lead time, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history. This keeps orders conservative, reduces holding cost risk given already-high inventory, and lets the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost using full-sample statistics.
