Recent realized demand (Periods 40\u201344): 35,23,46,23,39 -> 29.2 avg; more recent window (P41\u2013P44) avg = (23+46+23+39)/4 = 32.75 units/period. (L+1)=5 periods demand \u2248 32.75\xd75 \u2248 164 units. Current on-hand alone covers ~12.4 periods and exceeds the 5-period coverage target by a wide margin. OR recommended 0 units (base-stock capped) which is consistent given profit=holding so critical fractile=0.5 and safety factor\u22480. Ordering now would increase holding cost without materially increasing sales given current demand. Final strategy: place no order this period (0 units) to avoid excessive holding cost while on-hand inventory is ample to cover expected demand over the lead+review horizon.
