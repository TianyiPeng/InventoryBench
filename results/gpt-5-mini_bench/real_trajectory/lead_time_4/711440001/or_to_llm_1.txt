{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, etc.), so use L=4. Inventory & demand analysis: on-hand=101 + in-transit=178 => pipeline+on-hand=279 units. Recent demand (Periods 39\u201346) averaged \u224854 units/week; using a 5-period coverage requirement (L+1=5) gives target pipeline coverage \u224854\xd75\u2248270 units. OR recommends 86 but that policy uses promised LT and historical data; given confirmed LT=4 and current pipeline already slightly above 5-period demand, additional ordering would raise holding cost without materially increasing expected sales. Final strategy: place no order this period to avoid excess holding cost while pipeline suffices to cover the lead-time horizon and short-term demand volatility.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Confirmed LT=4 and current pipeline (279 units) already covers ~5 periods of recent demand (~54/week), so I place 0 to avoid excess holding cost instead of OR's 86.",
