Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand: 2019-01-07:11, 01-14:11, 01-21:10, 01-28:11, 02-04:74 (single large spike). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. The Feb 4 spike is a single-week event (not 3+ sustained periods), so no confirmed regime change. To avoid overreacting to a lone outlier while respecting the promised lead time, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demands show a large spike (74 on 2019-02-04 and 98 in Period 1) but only one concluded high period so not yet a sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=70 and Period 1 order arrived=0 in conclude \u2014 no confirmed lead-time change (no arrivals concluded). I therefore keep lead time at default (promised), and use default demand/volatility calculations (which incorporate all observed samples including Period 1) so the OR backend increases target base-stock to reflect the recent high draws while respecting holding cost tradeoff.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demand (Period1=98, Period2=107) is far above earlier Jan samples (11,11,10,11,74) but signal is only 2 periods long so not yet a sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=171 (matches orders placed in P1+P2) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer actual lead time; shipments may still arrive per promised lead time. To avoid overreacting to a short spike while the OR engine uses promised lead time, I keep L at default (promised) and use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L and corresponding std) so the backend balances increased service level versus holding cost without overfitting to a 2-period spike.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1-3 conclude) is high: 98, 107, 81 versus historical winter samples (~10-11 with one 74). No concluded arrivals have been observed despite substantial in-transit = 292, so shipments are delayed but no confirmed change in lead time (cannot infer from non-concluded). I set L explicit=4 (use promised lead time as best estimate given lack of confirmed different lead time). Demand appears to have shifted to a higher regime; I use a recent_N forecast to capture this: mu_hat uses recent_N N=3 (mean of last 3 demands scaled by 1+L) so the OR engine will target stock for the new higher demand over the review+lead period. I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=3 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize service (higher base_stock) to avoid lost sales given the sudden sustained jump in demand while avoiding overreliance on older low-demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 1 (2019-02-11 to 2019-02-25): recent avg = 95.33 (Periods 1-3) vs historical avg \u2248 11 (prior samples) (+>750%); treat as sustained until contradicted.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand elevated vs historical: last 4 demands = [98,107,81,67], recent mean=88.25 (regime starting Period1). On-hand=0, in-transit=410 which is close to (1+L)*recent_mean if L=4. No concluded arrivals yet that would allow inferring actual lead time, so keep L as promised (default). Use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new high-demand regime (regime length=4 \u2192 N=4). This balances service (avoid stockouts in elevated regime) while letting OR backend cap orders via its cap.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent history shows large demand regime beginning Period 1 but with cooling in the last two weeks; observed arrival in Period 5 confirms actual observed lead_time=4 (Order P1 arrived P5). On-hand=26, in-transit=405 (large pipeline). To respect observed lead time I set L by calculate (uses observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (Periods 1-5) to capture the new regime while including the most recent cooling; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base-stock to service the elevated regime while accounting for recent downward drift and the large in-transit pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent demand regime is much higher than historical: Periods 1-3 average \u224895.33/week vs prior \u224811. Observed arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2192P5 and P2\u2192P6), so use observed lead time. On-hand=72 and in-transit=318 => pipeline + on-hand = 390 units, which covers multiple weeks of the high-demand regime (expected weekly demand \u224895). To target service while limiting holding cost, set L to the calculated observed lead time, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the recent 3-period regime (N=3) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility reflecting the new higher-demand regime.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 1 (period demands: P1 98, P2 107, P3 81, P4 67, P5 44, P6 55, P7 44). Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P3 arrived after 4 periods). On-hand (149) + in-transit (197) = 346 units, which covers multiple periods of elevated demand. I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times to confirm the confirmed lead_time=4. For demand forecasting I use recent_N over the most recent regime (N=7, Periods 1\u20137) to capture the elevated demand level while accounting for recent tapering. I apply the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect current volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine to hold stock for the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting excess by using recent observations.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand since 2019-02-11 shows a sustained higher regime (Periods 1-8: {98,107,81,67,44,55,44,65}) vs prior historical low values; on-hand=202, in-transit=135 so pipeline is healthy but demand remains elevated. Multiple concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time \u22484. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N N=8 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the full elevated regime (captures current mean/variance and avoids diluting with older low-demand samples). This increases target base stock to maintain service while controlling holding cost given clear sustained demand shift.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8)

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent demand has fallen from the early spike (Periods 1-3 avg ~95) to lower levels in the most recent 3 periods (Periods 7-9 demands = 44,65,32; recent avg \u224847). On-hand=235, in-transit=128; pipeline provides coverage given confirmed lead time. Lead time historically observed = 4 (consistent with promised). To react to the now-lower recent demand regime and avoid excess holding cost, set L to calculated (uses observed lead times) and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent N=3 periods to reflect the downward shift in demand and reduce target base-stock and safety stock accordingly.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent historical demand showed a large regime shift starting Period 1 (Periods 1-3 mean \u224895.33/wk) which was recorded earlier and remains our primary forecast anchor. On-hand=225 + in-transit=114 = 339 units; promised lead time=4 and (1+L)=5 so target demand coverage should be ~5\xd7weekly mean. I set L to 'calculate' so backend will use observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand I choose recent_N with N=3 to preserve the detected high-demand regime (use the three high early samples), producing mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent_mean. Sigma_hat set to default to reflect overall sample variability across the (1+L) horizon. These choices prioritize service (avoid stockouts in a higher-demand regime) while sigma_hat/default and backend capping will limit extreme over-ordering.

Recent demand (Periods 5-11) has moderated vs the initial spike; using a recent-window forecast will better capture current demand level and volatility.

For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 (Periods 5-11) to forecast (1+L)-period demand and variability so the OR backend sizes base stock to current demand while avoiding excess holding given sizable on-hand + pipeline. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by focusing on recent realized demand rather than the early spike period.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-02-11 (many consecutive elevated weeks) though weekly demand has trended down from early peak; on-hand=235, in-transit=58 (no recent unexplained lost shipments; prior periods confirm LT=4). To ensure coverage for the review+lead horizon and reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 12 demand samples to capture the current regime (N=12 covers all available post-changepoint samples). This increases available safety stock for service while using recent volatility for realistic safety sizing given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since Period 1 (recent demands: P1-P13 = [98,107,81,67,44,55,44,65,32,24,24,22,22]); on-hand=271, in-transit=38 (no overdue missing arrivals). Lead time observations consistently show 4 periods. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N over the full recent regime (N=13) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand pattern across the review+lead window. L set to calculate to confirm observed lead time=4. This balances service (higher mean) versus holding cost by sizing base-stock to recent demand and actual variability.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20. Recent demand has reverted from initial spike to a lower stable level: last 6 demands (Periods 9-14) = [32,24,24,22,22,40], mean \u224827.33. On-hand=231 + in-transit=48 \u2192 279 units available. With promised L=4 and forecast horizon (1+L)=5, using a recent_N demand estimate (N=6) yields (1+L)*mean \u2248136.7 units \u2014 coverage appears sufficient and avoids excess holding given holding cost $1 vs profit $4. Lead-time observations (P1->P5 ... P4->P8) consistently show 4 periods; use calculated L from observed lead times. I choose: L by calculate to lock observed 4-period lead time; mu_hat by recent_N (N=6) to capture the recent lower-demand regime; sigma_hat by recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (enough to cover ~5 periods of recent demand) versus holding cost by not using the much larger early-sample mean.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent realized demand has declined from the early high spike (Periods 1-4) to much lower weekly sales in recent weeks (Periods 9-15 demand series: 32,24,24,22,22,40,25 \u2192 avg \u2248 26). On-hand=206, in-transit=48 (total pipeline 254) \u2014 ample cover for several weeks at current run-rate; no overdue arrivals beyond confirmed 4-period lead time. I set L to default (promised 4) consistent with confirmed observations. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (last 8 demand observations) so the OR backend will target lower target stock and reduce holding cost while maintaining service for current demand levels.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=197, in-transit=48. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 (multiple P1->P5 ... P4->P8), so use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Recent demand regime has settled to lower volumes since the early-Feb spike; I base demand forecast on the most recent 12 periods to capture the post-spike regime (stable lower demand). Thus set L=calculate (avg observed=4), mu_hat=recent_N with N=12 to compute (1+L)\xd7mean of last 12 demands, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=12 to capture recent volatility. These choices align pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods while avoiding overweighting the early spike, balancing service (profit $4 vs holding $1) and holding costs given large on-hand inventory.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=220, in-transit=10; inventory is ample relative to recent demand, so no aggressive replenishment needed. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent P1->P5 ... P4->P8). Demand has shown a sustained lower regime since the early spike; I therefore base demand estimates on the most recent contiguous regime to avoid over-ordering. Set L to promised/default (4) to align with confirmed arrivals. Use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the post-spike demand regime (Periods 5\u201317), reducing forecast bias from the early spike and keeping stock targets moderate given holding cost >0 and profit=4. This approach keeps OR backend service-level conservative while avoiding excess holding costs given current high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17 (Period 19). On-hand=218, in-transit=0, no arrivals expected this period. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods; use calculated lead time. Recent demand since arrivals resumed has moderated versus the early spike; to reflect the current lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand and volatility to focus the (1+L)-period forecast on the most recent observations (balances service vs holding given high on-hand). recent_N chosen as 8 to cover ~2 months of recent concluded weeks while remaining >=3 and <=20. These parameters reduce ordering pressure given large on-hand and confirmed L=4.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent observed demand has fallen to ~13 units/week (Periods 17-19: 15,12,12). On-hand = 206, in-transit = 0; several prior orders confirmed with lead time = 4. To avoid excess holding cost given high inventory and low recent demand, keep promised lead time and base mu_hat/sigma_hat on the most recent 3 weeks. L uses promised (default). mu_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect current low regime: (1+L)*mean_recent = 5*~13 = ~65 forecast across review+lead. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=3) to capture recent low volatility. These parameters reduce replenishment given ample on-hand stock and zero pipeline while the OR engine will cap orders appropriately.

To keep inventory responsive and limit holding cost given high on-hand, set mu_hat using recent_N=6 (covers review+lead demand = 5\xd7recent mean).

Date 2019-07-22. Recent demand has returned to low baseline since the Feb spike: last 8 demands (P16-P23) avg \u2248 9.1 units/week. On-hand=181, in-transit=0 \u2014 large on-hand cushion vs expected near-term demand. Lead time evidence (concluded history) consistently 4 periods; use calculated lead time. Set demand forecast to reflect the recent low regime using the last 8 periods to avoid over-ordering from the Feb spike. Use same recent window for volatility.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29 (Period 25). On-hand=176, in-transit=0; recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods and there are currently no overdue arrivals. Demand spiked early (Feb) per carry-over but recent weekly demand has been much lower and variable; no new sustained regime shift detected. To keep the OR engine calibrated to its historical statistics and to rely on the confirmed lead-time, I select default lead time and default demand moment estimates so the backend uses promised/observed LT=4 and the full-sample mean/std for (1+L) demand and volatility. This avoids overreacting to transient spikes while letting the OR cap/order logic decide replenishment given large on-hand stock.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been low and stable since late April (Periods 11-25) after the early-Feb spike; I therefore use a recent-sample forecast to capture the current low regime. On-hand=158, in-transit=43 (no arrivals yet visible from Period 25 order). Lead time remains 4 (promised and historically confirmed). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=15 to reflect the last 15 demand observations (captures the sustained low-demand regime and recent variability) so the OR backend sizes the base-stock to meet (1+L) periods of current demand while avoiding excess holding given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit. No explicit sigma/value overrides.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has settled at low weekly levels since Period 11 (multiple consecutive periods with single- to low-double-digit demand) after the early spike in Feb\u2013Mar. On-hand=128 + in-transit=43 = 171 units; with promised L=4 (use default) this provides coverage for (1+L)=5 periods. I select L=default to trust the promised lead time (confirmed historically as 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=16) to base mu_hat on the most recent stable regime (Periods 11\u201326) and sigma_hat recent_N (N=16) to reflect recent volatility; using recent samples prevents the early Feb spike from inflating forecasts and reduces excess holding cost while maintaining service. No evidence of new lost shipments or lead-time changes since confirmations; parameters aim to align base-stock with the current low-demand regime and limit over-ordering given $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Historical early spike (Periods 1-4) was large, but demand since Period 5 has been substantially lower and stable. On-hand=64, in-transit=43 (pipeline=107) \u2014 sufficient to cover several weeks at recent demand levels. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default. Detected demand regime change starting Period 5; use recent_N (N=20) to capture the post-spike regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR base-stock reflects the lower sustained demand and avoids excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 5: avg decreased from 95.33 (Periods 1-3 spike) to 25.52 (Periods 5-27) \u2248 -73%, treat as new sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26): recent demand regime (Periods 5-27) is the sustained lower-demand regime (avg \u224825.5/week). On-hand=2 + in-transit=81 -> pipeline=83, which covers several weeks under the lower regime but recent spikes (Periods 26-28) warrant keeping some buffer. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use promised/default. For demand forecast use recent_N over the established lower-demand regime to reflect current mean and variance; regime length is 23 periods so cap N at 20 per rules. Thus set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the most recent 20 demand samples, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

LLM Rationale:

Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 5 (Periods 5-27 avg \u224825.52 vs earlier spike); use recent regime data to forecast. Set L by calculation to reflect observed lead times. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to capture the current lower-demand regime (capped at 20). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 for volatility from the same recent regime. These choices ensure the OR backend targets service appropriate to the sustained lower-demand regime while respecting confirmed lead time and avoiding excess holding costs.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. Recent demand shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 5 (covered in carry-over), but weeks 28-30 show transient spikes; to be conservative for the OR engine I use average recent demand over the last 20 samples to capture the post-spike regime while smoothing short blips. Set L via calculated observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the most relevant recent regime while limiting noise from the immediate 3-week spike. This balances high service-level (profit/holding -> q=0.8) with avoidance of overstock from one-off surges. Current on-hand=0, in-transit=146 will be reconciled by backend ordering rule.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=0, in-transit=241. Historical mid-year regime (Periods 5-27) averaged \u224825.5/week, but Periods 30-32 show a clear upward shift (demands 131,164,131). Pipeline (241) covers only ~1.7 weeks at recent demand; likely undersupplied if spike persists. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use calculated lead time. For demand I use a recent_N=3 estimate to capture the new high-demand regime (samples P30-P32) and same for sigma to reflect recent volatility; this alerts the OR engine to raise the base stock and service level while acknowledging increased variability. These choices prioritize meeting the observed surge while the carry-over records the new regime for future periods.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 30: avg P30-32 = 142.0 vs prior regime avg \u224825.5 (+456%); treat as new sustained higher-demand regime until contradicted.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent demand has been in a confirmed high regime starting Period 30 (P30-34 high: 131,164,131,293,96). On-hand=0, in-transit=614\u2014pipeline is large but arrivals have shown consistent 4-period actual lead time. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (P30-34) to capture the current high-demand regime; sigma_hat also uses recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR backend toward a higher base stock to avoid stockouts during this sustained high-demand regime while relying on observed lead-time behavior to avoid over-ordering for lost/delayed shipments.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand shows a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 30 (weeks P30-P35: 131,164,131,293,96,60). On-hand=0, in-transit=844 (large pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent_N over the 6-period regime (P30-35) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand; keep L as default (promised 4, consistent with observations). This balances higher service from increased forecast against holding cost because substantial in-transit inventory (844) already provides coverage; recent_N prevents overreacting to older low-demand history.

Period 37 (2019-10-21). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple P conclude messages P1->P5 ... P4->P8). Current inventory: on-hand=34, in-transit=807 \u2014 large pipeline relative to recent demand. Recent demand regime shift began at Period 30; I use the recent regime to forecast.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand regime: sustained high demand starting Period 30 (P30-37 shows large spikes vs prior regime). Lead time has repeatedly been 4 periods (multiple concluded P->P+4 arrivals). On-hand=145, in-transit=633 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand is elevated; use recent-demand estimates to size base stock to current high regime while keeping L estimated from observed arrivals. Set L=calculate to lock in observed LT=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (Periods 30-37) to reflect the new high-demand regime and variance, so OR backend will target service at current profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (P1->P5 ... P34->P38). Current inventory is high: on-hand=342, in-transit=326. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 30 (Periods 30-38 show elevated demand vs prior regime). I therefore keep L at the promised/confirmed value and set demand forecast and volatility using the recent high-demand regime. Chosen methods: L=default (use promised 4); mu_hat=recent_N using the most recent regime since Period 30 \u2014 regime length = 9 (Periods 30\u201338) so N=9 to capture current higher mean; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=9 to capture recent volatility. This biases orders to satisfy elevated demand while the OR backend will cap orders given pipeline and holding cost tradeoff.

Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=555, in-transit=117. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Demand regime: sustained high-demand regime starting Period 30 (P30-32 avg \u2248142 vs prior \u224825). I set L by calculating observed lead times to capture confirmed L=4. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=10 (regime from P30 to P39 is 10 periods) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability using the most recent high-demand regime, balancing service (avoid stockouts in current high regime) versus holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; on-hand=520, in-transit=128 (ample short-term cover). Recent demand (Periods 36-40 = 40,63,110,76,72) averages ~72 and reflects the post-Period-30 higher-demand regime, so I bias mu and sigma to recent data to avoid overstocking from older low-demand samples while preserving service. I set L via recent observed lead times to confirm actual LT=4; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5) to target the current regime and keep holding costs reasonable given high on-hand inventory.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Recent demand regime is the high-demand regime that began at Period 30 (sustained elevated demand through Period 41). Inventory is ample: on-hand=475, in-transit=128. Set L via 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (all observed =4). For demand forecast use recent_N over the current high-demand regime to capture elevated mean and variance; regime length since P30 = 12 periods, so N=12 (per rules N = min(regime_length,20), \u22653). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the OR backend on the current high-demand mean and volatility while the calculated L ensures pipeline coverage for the confirmed 4-period lead time. This balances service (avoid stockouts in high regime) against holding cost given large on-hand position.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02. Recent history shows the higher-demand regime that began at Period 30 (P30-42 length = 13 periods) remains in effect (many large weekly demands including a P42 spike =148). On-hand=327, in-transit=191 provides ample coverage short-term but demand remains elevated. I keep L at the promised lead time (4) because concluded history consistently shows 4-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N over the most recent regime (N=13) to capture the sustained higher-demand mean and volatility; this focuses the OR base-stock on the elevated demand pattern while avoiding dilution by pre-regime low-demand samples. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=13) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias ordering toward higher service during this sustained high-demand regime while limiting excess inventory from older low-demand data.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=381, in-transit=271. Historical concluded data confirm actual lead time=4 (multiple P->P+4 observations). Recent demand has been elevated/volatile (recent 5 concluded demands P39-P43 = 76,72,45,148,26; mean\u224873.4) reflecting the high-demand regime that began around Period 30. Pipeline + on-hand (652 units) currently large vs short-term demand, but volatility and holiday timing justify using recent data to size review+lead demand. Set L to promised/default (4) since actual lead time already confirmed and equals promised. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the current high but variable regime ((1+L)\xd7recent mean will anchor base-stock to current demand levels). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility and ensure safety stock scales to observed variability. These choices help the OR backend balance service level during sustained high-demand regime while avoiding excessive long-term overstock by using a short recent window.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 and recent demand regime has been volatile (large spikes around Periods 30-39, then mixed lower weeks). Current inventory on-hand=403 + in-transit=223 = 626 units, which is well above typical (recent) multi-period demand; to avoid excess holding cost I will keep lead time and demand estimates at defaults so the OR engine uses full historical mean/variance with promised L=4. This balances service level (profit/holding ratio implies high fill target) while avoiding additional explicit replenishment bias given ample pipeline.

LLM Rationale:

On-hand=428, in-transit=160 (ample pipeline). I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead times (all observed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=17 (Periods 30-46) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while letting the backend scale mu_hat by (1+L). Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=17 to reflect recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to the current high-demand regime while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock given already-large on-hand + pipeline.
