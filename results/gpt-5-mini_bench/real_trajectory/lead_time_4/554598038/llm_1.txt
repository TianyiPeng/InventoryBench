{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (year-end/holiday trough likely completed). Product is a basic women's T-shirt (low seasonality at year-end). Demand analysis: recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 34 (avg \u224818/week, more recent 7-week avg \u224812/week). Lead time: historically confirmed as 4 periods. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand=114, in-transit=0. With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand; at recent demand \u224812\u201318/week that implies 60\u201390 units needed over the next 5 weeks. Current on-hand (114) already covers this with cushion. Ordering would arrive after 4 periods and incur holding costs meanwhile. Given high holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs profit ($4/unit sold), avoid overstock. Final action: place no order this period.",
