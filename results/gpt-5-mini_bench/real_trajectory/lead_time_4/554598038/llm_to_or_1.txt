Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand shows a clear upward shift starting 2019-01-21 (11, 17, 38), suggesting a new higher-demand regime. No concluded arrival messages exist to suggest lead-time deviation, so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent demand increase while remaining parsimonious, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (regime length=3: 2019-01-21..2019-02-04). This raises the (1+L)-period demand forecast and variance to improve fill rates given high service target (profit/ (profit+holding)=0.8).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: recent avg (2019-01-21..2019-02-04)=22 units/week vs prior avg=0 (samples before 2019-01-21); treat as sustained unless reversed.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 2 (2019-02-18). Recent sustained demand regime beginning 2019-01-21: recent weekly avg \u224822 (samples 2019-01-21..2019-02-04). No concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 ordered=46 arrived=0) \u2014 insufficient evidence to declare lead-time change or lost shipment. Use promised lead time. Set demand forecasts based on the recent regime (regime length=3 \u2192 N=3) so the backend scales (1+L)\xd7mean to cover review+lead period. This addresses the observed on-hand=0, in-transit=46 which is below the (1+L)-period demand under the new regime.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent observed demand has jumped (Period1 demand=54, Period2=100) on top of earlier regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (samples: 11,17,38). On-hand=0, in-transit=113; P1 and P2 orders not yet concluded but not overdue given promised L=4. I keep L=default (promised=4) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time. To capture the clear upward demand acceleration while still smoothing noise, I use EWMA for mu_hat with gamma=0.5 so recent large demands get substantial weight; sigma_hat stays default to let the backend scale volatility from full history. This raises the base-stock to favor service (profit>holding) while avoiding overreaction to one-off spikes; using default L avoids misinterpreting in-transit non-conclusions as lost shipments.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). Recent demand regime since 2019-01-21: mean \u224822 units/week (samples 2019-01-21,01-28,02-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=243 but orders from P1-P3 show arrived=0 -> evidence of delayed/lost shipments. To protect service given confirmed higher demand and likely extended/uncertain lead times, set lead time explicitly longer than promised to account for delays; use recent demand samples (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the new higher regime. This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while acknowledging holding cost tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Delayed/lost shipments: orders placed in Periods 1-3 (46,67,130) all show arrived=0 while in-transit=243, indicating shipments delayed or lost (sustained for 3 periods).

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent demand jumped starting 2019-01-21 (samples 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 mean=22 vs prior=0). On-hand=0, in-transit=383. Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals yet so do not change L. Use recent_N=3 for demand and volatility to capture the new higher regime (weeks with 11,17,38). This raises base_stock to cover (1+L) periods under the new regime while keeping L at promised value so OR backend accounts for lead time correctly despite in-transit uncertainty.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent demand has risen sharply (Period1-5 demands = [54,100,113,88,56], recent avg=82.2) versus earlier low-Jan samples; pipeline shows large in-transit (458) with one concluded arrival confirming lead time evidence. I set L to calculate to use observed lead-time data (observed = 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (use last 5 periods). Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the new higher demand while L informed by observed arrivals avoids underestimating pipeline delay from past missing shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent history: sustained demand increase beginning 2019-01-21 (recent avg\u224822 from early samples) and much higher realized weekly demands in Periods 1\u20136 (54,100,113,88,56,71). Two concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6) and multiple prior delayed arrivals indicate shipments may be unreliable; pipeline=394. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time average (captures confirmed L=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to base mu_hat on the last 6 observed demands (captures the new higher-demand regime and recent volatility). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=6) so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices prioritize meeting elevated near-term demand while recognizing confirmed lead time and recent variability, mitigating stockouts despite past delays.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent weeks show sustained higher demand versus early Jan baseline; recent sold/demand history (Periods 3-7 = 113,88,56,71,114) indicates current regime mean ~88.4/week. On-hand=16, in-transit=317 (large pipeline from earlier orders) \u2014 no new confirmed lost shipments; observed lead times consistently 4 periods. I set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent high-demand regime (last 5 weeks) so the OR engine targets service for current demand while avoiding excessive extra ordering given large in-transit stock and $1 holding cost vs $4 profit.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods (arrivals from P1..P4 each showed W=4). Recent demand regime increased starting 2019-01-21 (recent weeks avg ~22/wk vs prior ~0). On-hand=49 and in-transit=308 provide substantial cover; no outstanding unexplained losses currently. I set L explicit=4 to lock in the observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize the new higher-demand regime and recent variability (captures most recent 5 weeks of realized demand), which guides the OR backend toward a higher base-stock while controlling holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Lead time has been confirmed at 4 periods from concluded history (P1\u2192P5). Current on-hand=48 and in-transit=312 (pipeline=360) which already covers multiple future periods. Recent demand regime is much higher than early samples (sustained high weekly demand across Periods 1-9). To reflect the new, higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility (N=5 most recent demand observations) while keeping L as the promised/default 4 so the OR backend aligns with contract lead time. This balances service (capture higher recent demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22): on-hand=0, in-transit=451. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders from P1..P6 all arrived with W=4). Demand has been elevated and stable since the late-Jan regime shift; recent 10 concluded demand observations (Periods 1-10) show sustained high weekly demand. I set L using calculate to lock in observed lead time=4. I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the most recent sustained demand regime, balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Demand has been high and rising since the Jan 21 regime shift; recent weekly demand (Periods 7-11) avg \u2248128 units. On-hand=0, in-transit=478 which is below (L+1)*recent demand (~5*128=640) so pipeline is currently insufficient. Use promised lead time (default) since concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period LT. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (5-week window covers latest stable high-demand periods) so the OR base-stock and cap reflect current elevated mean and volatility while limiting inventory build-up given holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-05-06 (P13). Demand has been elevated since 2019-01-21 and recently (P8..P12) shows sustained higher weekly demand (107,122,133,164,150). Lead time repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. I set L via observed average (calculate). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher regime (weeks P8\u2013P12) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent volatility over the same 5-week window. This balances service (capture recent higher demand) against holding cost by focusing on the most recent sustained regime.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand regime (since 2019-01-21) is much higher (~100\u2013160/week in most recent 9 weeks) vs prior near-zero; on-hand=7, in-transit=560 (large pipeline). Historical concludes consistently show 4-period actual lead time. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times and set mu_hat/sigma_hat using the most recent 9 demand periods (periods 5\u201313) so the OR backend targets a base-stock sized for the current high-demand regime while sigma is estimated from the same recent window to capture higher variability. This balances service (avoid stockouts given strong recent demand) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

On-hand=27, in-transit=491 \u2014 ample pipeline but historical patterns show 4-period actual lead time confirmed repeatedly. Set L via observed averages to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). Demand has been in a higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained elevated weekly demand across periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=0, in-transit=533 (pipeline large). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend confirm observed lead time from concluded history (matches confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=11) to base mu_hat on the most recent sustained high-demand regime (captures the last ~11 weeks of demand after the uptick) so the base-stock target reflects current higher mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=11 to capture recent volatility. These choices prioritize meeting elevated demand while the large in-transit reduces aggressive ordering; using recent data avoids diluting the forecast with the pre-uptick zeros and helps balance service level vs. holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead-time observations (concluded arrivals) consistently show 4 periods. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I set lead time by observed average and compute demand parameters from the recent regime data (to capture current mean/volatility). This keeps the base-stock sized to meet service with acceptable holding given profit=$4 vs holding=$1.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand regime is elevated and stable (recent weekly demand ~120\u2013150 units). On-hand=68, in-transit=460 => total pipeline=528 units, which covers ~4+ weeks at current demand; we still use an inferred lead time from observed concludes. Set L by calculating average observed lead time (consistent 4). For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the post-changepoint high-demand regime (N=12 covers the most recent periods of the new regime). Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale variability over (1+L) periods. These choices keep service high during sustained elevated demand while allowing the OR engine to cap orders to limit holding costs given large pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-17 (Period 19). Recent history shows stable actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime established since 2019-01-21. Current on-hand=59 and in-transit=592 (ample pipeline). No evidence of new changepoint or lost shipments. Use default lead time (promised 4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses full historical mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps service level tuned to observed demand while avoiding unnecessary extra safety stock given large in-transit quantity.

On-hand=54, in-transit=470 (large pipeline). To keep service high while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default) and set demand/volatility from the most recent data window to capture current regime. recent_N=8 balances responsiveness to current demand pattern with some smoothing; this raises base stock to avoid stockouts given observed high weekly demand while the OR cap limits excessive ordering.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=35, in-transit=504 \u2014 ample pipeline but shipments historically have 4-period lead time. I set L=calculate to lock actual observed lead time (historical concludes consistently show 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained regime (~last 20 weeks), which captures the post-changepoint higher mean and current variability and balances service vs holding costs given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Pipeline + on-hand (519 total) appears ample vs. recent demand, so use default lead time and default demand-statistics to let the OR backend compute base-stock and cap from full-sample mean/variance ((1+L) scaling). This balances service (use confirmed L=4) against holding cost by not overreacting to short-term noise.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent realized demand is in a higher regime (sustained weekly demand ~110\u2013150 since 2019-01-21). On-hand=183 and in-transit=301 provide ample coverage vs. typical weekly demand; no overdue shipments visible. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and recent variability; sigma_hat uses the same recent window so safety stock scales to recent volatility. These parameters aim to balance service (higher recent mean) with holding cost by basing forecasts on the most recent sustained regime rather than older zero-demand samples.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=66, in-transit=455. Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (many P1..P18 orders observed with W=4) so use calculated average lead time. Demand underwent a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (recent weekly mean ~22 vs prior 0) and recent weeks show elevated, variable demand; to capture the current regime I use a recent_N estimate for demand mean and volatility with N=20 (capped at 20) to prioritize latest 20 samples. This raises the backend base-stock to preserve service while capping orders limits inventory risk given holding cost (Profit=$4, Holding=$1).

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=119, in-transit=413. Historical concluded arrivals show a consistent 4-period lead time; recent single missed arrival (Period 23) is not yet a sustained loss pattern. Demand shifted up starting 2019-01-21 and has persisted; to capture the current higher-demand regime I use a recent-window forecast. Choices: L kept at promised/default (4) because concluded history consistently shows LT=4; mu_hat uses recent_N (N=20) to focus the (1+L) demand forecast on the sustained higher-demand regime; sigma_hat uses default to let backend scale volatility over (1+L). These params prioritize service (higher mu_hat from recent demand) while default sigma and confirmed L keep order caps consistent with observed lead time and limit excess holding costs given current sizable pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-08-05 (P26). Recent weeks show stable demand ~100-160/week with on-hand=108 and in-transit=465. Historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=4 for many periods. I choose L=calculate to use observed lead-time average (confirmed =4). Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=12) to capture the current post-launch regime (recent sustained higher weekly demand) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent demand volatility. This keeps base-stock responsive to the higher recent demand while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand samples. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments needed because concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand has been a sustained higher regime since 2019-01-21 (weekly demand ~100\u2013150 in recent months vs near-zero earlier). On-hand=74, in-transit=479 \u2014 pipeline is large and consistent with observed 4-period arrivals (many concluded lead_time=4). No new evidence of lost shipments since arrivals consistently matched orders with lead_time=4 after Period 5. To capture the recent elevated demand regime and reduce sensitivity to old near-zero samples, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 20 demand observations (largest reasonable recent window per rules). I keep L as default (promised lead time=4) because concluded history confirms 4-period arrivals and no sustained change. This balances service (covering the (1+L) review+lead horizon using recent demand) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). SKU 554598038 has on-hand=159 and in-transit=420. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P arrivals confirm), and demand has been elevated since 2019-01-21 (sustained regime). Given confirmed LT=4 (matches promised) and stable higher demand regime, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean across all samples and variance across all samples. This leverages full history to smooth variability while the pipeline (420) plus on-hand provides several weeks of cover; defaults let the capped policy moderate order sizes vs holding cost (profit=4, holding=1 implies moderate service quantile). No evidence of new lost shipments or fresh changepoints since Period 27.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows stable observed lead_time = 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). On-hand=201, in-transit=303 \u2014 pipeline healthy. Demand regime shift identified earlier (starting 2019-01-21) persists (sustained higher weekly demand). I set L using observed data (calculate) to ensure backend uses measured lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime while smoothing older zero-demand weeks; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward servicing the higher recent demand while limiting excess holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (high service-level weight).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has settled lower vs the early-Feb/March ramp; latest weekly sales (Periods 22-29) ~64\u2013117 with a recent run ~64\u201375. Current inventory: on-hand=282, in-transit=291 (healthy pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 periods. I set L='calculate' to use observed lead-time average (matches promised 4). For demand I use a recent_N window to focus the (1+L) demand forecast on the latest regime (N=8 captures the most recent ~2 months of weeks including current lower sales). I use recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base stock responsive to the current lower-demand regime while recognizing the stable 4-period lead time and the large existing pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Recent history shows stable realized lead time = 4 periods and steady weekly demand since the early 2019 regime shift; on-hand=292, in-transit=228 (pipeline sufficient near-term). No new prolonged missing shipments observed. I therefore use calculate for L to reflect observed lead-time data (will yield 4). Use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history, leveraging the confirmed lead time and long-run demand estimates to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has been stable since the regime shift that began 2019-01-21 (samples 2019-01-21..2019-02-04 avg=22/week vs prior=0); recent weekly demand over the most recent history is moderate (many weekly samples since shift). On-hand=350, in-transit=156 => pipeline inventory comfortable versus weekly demand, so avoid escalating target stock. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. I set L using calculated observed lead times to match confirmed behavior, use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat (to bias to recent demand levels and avoid over-ordering given high on-hand), and keep sigma_hat as default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (match observed L and recent demand) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). Recent demand has trended down since July (Period 23..32 demand series: 117,106,104,83,69,75,64,53,37,29) while on-hand=321 and in-transit=252 (pipeline=573) \u2014 ample cover vs expected demand. Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods in history. I select L=default to use promised lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to capture the current lower-demand regime (Periods 23\u201332) so mu_hat reflects the recent weekly mean scaled by (1+L) and sigma_hat uses recent volatility over the same window. This reduces over-ordering versus using long-run averages and balances service level with holding cost given high on-hand+pipeline.

Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead time and prior sustained demand regime shift (higher demand since 2019-01-21) but recent trailing weeks (Periods 22\u201333) show a declining/stable lower-demand regime. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead-time average (confirmed ~4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 (covering Periods 22\u201333) so the forecast and uncertainty reflect the most recent demand level and volatility, avoiding over-ordering given high on-hand and non-negligible holding cost (holding $1 vs profit $4).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent weekly demand has fallen from summer peaks to ~30\u201355/week (last 5 demands: 53,37,29,45,24 -> avg ~38). On-hand=385, in-transit=119 provides large coverage vs current low demand; no new sustained lead-time or demand regime changes since prior insights. I keep L as promised (default=4) because concluded history consistently shows 4-period arrivals. To capture the recent lower-demand regime and reduce excess holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses last 5 demand samples) so the backend computes a (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility focused on the current low-demand regime. This reduces target base-stock and caps ordering to limit holding cost while preserving service given observed lead time.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Recent demand has been much lower than the early-2019 surge; on-hand=392, in-transit=96 (ample coverage). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 when shipments arrive, though occasional lost arrivals occurred earlier. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead-time history (confirmed = 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained lower-demand regime since mid-2019 (reduces overstock risk while maintaining service). These parameters keep pipeline + on-hand sufficient for (1+L) periods while lowering forecasted mean and volatility to avoid unnecessary holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=471, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4; recent demand has fallen to low single-/double-digit weekly sales (recent 7 weeks mean used). To avoid fresh receipts given high on-hand, set L inferred from observed history, and use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so base-stock reflects the low recent demand and reduces ordering pressure.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has been low and stable (Periods 30-37 demands = 53,37,29,45,24,16,17,27) after the earlier regime shift in Feb\u2013Mar; on-hand is high (444) and in-transit 0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. To avoid over-ordering given large on-hand, keep lead time estimate based on observed history and use recent demand (last 8 periods) for mu and sigma so the OR engine targets a lower base-stock aligned with current lower demand. This balances service (using observed LT=4) against holding cost by shrinking forecasted demand window to recent behavior and capturing recent volatility.

To avoid unnecessary replenishment given high on-hand, set lead time to calculated average (confirmed 4) and use default demand estimates so backend's base-stock will reflect full sample history and suppress ordering.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11. Recent weekly demand has fallen from summer peaks (100s) to low teens (most recent demands: 12,12,27,12,17,16,24,45,29,37,53,64...). On-hand=420, in-transit=57 \u2014 ample cover vs current low demand but pipeline shows occasional missed arrivals historically. Observed lead time has been stable at 4 in concluded history; therefore keep promised lead time. To reflect the clear recent downward demand regime, use a recent-N forecast (captures current low-level regime) with N=12 (recent 12 concluded periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend sets a lower base-stock and reduces holding cost while preserving service. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments since lead time has been confirmed at 4 across many periods.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=412, in-transit=57. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple P -> P+4 observations), so use calculated lead time. Demand regime shifted up in Feb 2019 (avg ~22) but recent weeks (Periods 34-40 demands = 24,16,17,27,12,12,8) indicate a sustained lower recent demand regime. To reflect recent demand and lower recent volatility I use recent_N with N=7 (last 7 demand samples) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility; this balances service (avoid stockouts) with holding cost given high on-hand inventory and confirmed lead time. No explicit correction for lost shipments is needed because concluded history shows arrivals consistent with L=4.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent demand has been low and stable (last 5 weeks demand: 27,12,12,8,15 \u2192 avg ~15/week). On-hand=397, in-transit=57 provides large coverage versus recent demand; several past shipments confirmed lead_time=4. I set L via observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=5) to capture the validated low-demand regime and avoid overstocking given high on-hand. Sigma uses the same recent_N window to reflect recent low volatility. These choices reduce ordering to match current low demand while acknowledging the 4-period replenishment lag.

On-hand (379) + in-transit (57)=436 units, which already covers multiple weeks at recent demand rates. Lead time has been stable at 4 periods historically, so use promised/default L. To avoid overstock given high on-hand, set demand forecast using a recent-window average (N=8) so the OR backend reduces target base-stock; use the same recent window for volatility.

Lead time evidence is strong and consistent at 4 periods (many concluded arrivals show W=4). To reflect confirmed LT use calculated average lead time. To capture the recent lower-demand regime I use a recent-N demand estimate (N=20) covering the most recent ~20 weeks so the OR backend reduces recommended ordering from earlier high-rate regime. Keep sigma at default to reflect full-sample volatility scaling. These choices prioritize avoiding excess holding cost given high on-hand while still meeting demand and the confirmed lead time.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent weekly demand has been low (last months mostly 8\u201318 units/week) after the earlier regime shift in Feb\u2013May. On-hand=393, in-transit=35 \u2192 ample cover vs current low demand; no evidence of new lead-time disruption (historic actual lead time =4). To keep orders conservative and avoid excess holding cost, use the promised/default lead time and base demand estimates on recent history (capture the current low-demand regime). Chosen: L=default to keep lead time at the promised 4; mu_hat=schedule based on recent_N (uses last N samples to reflect recent low demand); sigma_hat=recent_N to reflect recent variability. This reduces inventory churn while maintaining service for current demand.
