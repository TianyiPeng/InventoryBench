  "rationale": "History shows a clear upward demand trend: weekly samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04 = [0, 2, 10, 16, 24]. OR computed base-stock using promised L=4 and historical stats and capped the order at ~27 units (matches OR output). Calculations: sample mean = 10.4 units/week, sample std \u2248 9.94; \u03bc\u0302 = (1+L)*mean = 5*10.4 = 52; \u03c3\u0302 = \u221a5*9.94 \u2248 22.24; base_stock \u2248 52 + 1.645*22.24 \u2248 89 (order_raw \u2248 89); OR cap \u2248 10.4 + 1.645*9.94 \u2248 26.8 \u2192 OR order 27. I believe demand has shifted upward recently (last 3 weeks avg = (10+16+24)/3 = 16.7, ~60% above the full-sample mean), so the OR cap is likely too conservative and risks stockouts during the 4-period lead time. With on-hand=0 and in-transit=0, we must cover (L+1)=5 upcoming weeks. Conservatively projecting continued elevated weekly demand ~16\u201324 (use midpoint ~20), 5-week demand \u2248100. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1), I favor ordering above OR's cap to avoid lost sales. I choose 40 units: it raises pipeline toward meeting elevated demand while limiting overstock risk (holding cost is low). This is a moderate upward override (\u2248+48% vs OR) to protect against the clear upward regime during the long lead time. I will monitor arrivals/concludes for lead-time confirmation and adjust future orders if arrivals or demand deviate.",
