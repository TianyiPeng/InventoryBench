Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a clear upward trend (0,2,10,16,24) with the last 3 periods averaging 16.67 units/week vs earlier very low demand. No concluded arrivals or observed lead-time data yet, so use promised lead time. To capture the new higher demand regime while limiting overreaction to volatility, set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect the sustained rise in the most recent 3 samples. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility around the new regime. This increases the base-stock to meet higher upcoming demand while keeping safety stock calibrated to recent variability, balancing service level and holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21: avg of last 3 samples (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04) = 16.67 vs earlier avg (2019-01-07 to 2019-01-14) = 1.00 (\u2248+1567%).

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand shows a sustained regime shift beginning 2019-01-21 (recent 3-sample mean >> earlier). On-hand=0, in-transit=29 units (ordered P1, not yet concluded). I keep L as default (promised 4) because no concluded arrivals exist to confirm a different lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher-demand regime (samples 2019-01-21..2019-02-04). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=3) so safety stock reflects the elevated recent variability. These choices focus the OR backend on the new higher demand while relying on the promised lead time until arrivals confirm otherwise; in-transit + new orders will be compared to (1+L)\xd7recent demand to balance service vs holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=56. Recent historical samples show a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (last 3 samples avg=16.67 vs earlier avg=1.0). Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals yet, so do not change L. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) to capture the new higher demand regime; set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent volatility. This biases orders upward to meet higher demand while the OR backend will cap by its cap formula.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent demand has risen sharply (last 3 concluded demands: 20, 55, 81) indicating a new higher regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=121 \u2014 this covers only part of the (L+1) demand under a higher regime. Promised lead time remains 4 (no concluded arrivals yet so cannot confirm a lead-time change). I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new regime (N=3 is the last consistent segment of high demand). Keeping L=default (promised) because no concluded arrivals contradict promise. This raises the base_stock to reflect higher short-term demand while sigma recent_N captures elevated volatility to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical demand shows a sustained upward regime since 2019-01-21 (recent 3-sample mean \u224816.67). Recent concludes show no arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (29,27,65,103 ordered; arrived=0), indicating shipments are delayed or lost and effective lead time > promised 4. To be conservative, set explicit lead time longer to let mu_hat cover a longer review+lead horizon and avoid stockouts. Use recent_N=3 for demand mean/volatility to capture the new higher-demand regime. These parameters raise the base stock to protect service level given delayed arrivals while sigma_recent captures current volatility; this balances profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by targeting demand-driven coverage rather than historic low mean.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed P1-P4 (29, 27, 65, 103) all arrived=0 through Period 4 conclude \u2014 suggests lead time exceeds promised 4 or shipments lost; treat as sustained delay.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime (large demands in Periods 3-5) and one confirmed lead-time observation: order placed P1 arrived in P5 => lead time = 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=364 (multiple older orders outstanding; one batch arrival confirmed). To capture the new higher-demand regime I use recent_N=3 (focus on the most recent 3 demand periods) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the (1+L)-horizon forecast and volatility reflect current elevated demand. For L I select 'calculate' so the backend uses the average of observed lead times (confirmed =4). These choices raise base-stock to meet the sustained higher demand while keeping sigma derived from recent volatility to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost=$1 and profit=$19.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent demand regime is elevated since 2019-01-21 (last 3 samples: 10,16,24 \u2192 mean=16.67). On-hand=0, in-transit=499 (several outstanding orders). Two concluded arrivals show actual lead_time=4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6) so use observed lead time. To capture the recent higher demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 samples (captures the new level and volatility). Using recent_N=3 keeps orders responsive to the sustained higher demand while the OR backend will cap ordering; L set to calculated average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order P1 arrived P5, order P2 arrived P6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=624. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Demand has shifted up markedly since Period 3; recent demand (Periods 3-7) = [81,144,89,157,184], mean=131 units/period. To capture the new high-demand regime and confirmed LT=4, set L based on observed average lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods to reflect the sustained higher mean/volatility. This yields a (1+L)-period demand forecast that matches recent demand while letting the OR engine compute safety stock from profit/holding tradeoff. In-transit (624) should cover much of the pipeline but parameters use recent demand to avoid underordering if shipments are delayed or lost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead time = 4 (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21 (sustained high weekly demand in recent periods). To reflect observed lead time use calculate (average observed). For demand, use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime and limit influence of low early samples; same recent_N=5 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias base-stock upward to meet high demand across the review+lead period while keeping variability estimated from the recent regime to avoid excess holding cost given holding=$1/unit.

To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime and recent observations, set L using observed lead times and set demand forecasts using the most recent 5 periods to capture the elevated mean/variance. This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit) against holding cost by letting the OR engine compute base-stock from recent demand estimates.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent weeks show a sustained high-demand regime (weekly demand \u2248135\u2013190) and lead time has been empirically confirmed as 4 periods from concluded arrivals. On-hand=61 and in-transit=643 (pipeline=704) comfortably cover several weeks of the elevated demand, so we use an observed lead-time estimate and a recent-window demand estimate to keep targets responsive to the new high-demand regime while avoiding excess stock. Set L based on observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand samples (Period 7\u201311) to capture the current high-demand mean/volatility.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6 (Period 13). On-hand=51 + in-transit=659 \u2192 ample pipeline vs. recent high demand. Historical concludes (Periods 5-12) consistently show actual lead time = 4. Demand shifted up starting 2019-01-21 and has remained elevated for many periods; use recent data to capture current regime. Choices: L: "calculate" to use observed lead times (confirmed = 4) so OR backend sizes pipeline correctly. mu_hat: "recent_N" with N=10 to forecast (1+L)-period demand using the last 10 demand samples, capturing the sustained higher-demand regime. sigma_hat: "recent_N" with N=10 to reflect volatility in the same recent window. These settings prioritize service (given high recent demand and large pipeline) while keeping holding costs in check by using a recent-regime mean/variance.

Early-sample demand shows a sustained regime shift starting 2019-01-21 (last 3 samples avg \u224816.67 vs earlier \u22481.0). To capture the higher recent demand level while using confirmed L=4, set L to default (promised), and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the post-changepoint regime and keep safety stock aligned with recent volatility. This balances service (higher mean) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=0, in-transit=752 \u2014 large pipeline but current on-hand empty. Historical concludes show consistent observed lead_time = 4 (multiple orders with W=4). Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21; recent periods show high weekly demand (several 100+ values in concludes). To respect confirmed lead time I set L via observed average (calculate). To capture the recent elevated demand regime and keep service while controlling holding cost I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases base_stock on the most recent demand behavior (short window to react to recent volatility). This balances profit ($19) against holding cost ($1) by focusing replenishment on recent high demand rather than long-run low mean.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=874. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 confirmations). Demand has moved to a higher regime since 2019-01-21 and recent weeks show elevated, volatile weekly demand (several weeks >140, recent peaks to 268). To capture the recent elevated regime I use recent_N=8 for demand mean and std (weights recent 8 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current higher demand while L uses calculated observed lead times (stable at 4). This balances service (avoid stockouts given large in-transit but zero on-hand) against holding cost by basing targets on recent realized demand and confirmed lead time. No shipments appear lost now; in-transit is large and will arrive per observed L.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent weeks show a sustained higher demand regime since 2019-01-21 (much larger weekly sales vs early Jan). On-hand=0, in-transit=905 \u2014 substantial pipeline but current on-hand is zero so we must keep stock to cover demand while avoiding excess holding. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4; use calculated lead time to reflect observations. For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the post-changepoint higher mean/volatility; selected N=8 to cover the most recent two months of weekly data (balances responsiveness vs noise). Using recent_N for sigma_hat aligns variability with the recent high-demand regime so the OR backend sets base stock to preserve service while limiting holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-01-21 and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand is low (5) with large in-transit (993) \u2014 pipeline coverage is substantial. I set L via observed lead-time average to lock in the confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=12) to focus the forecast on the sustained higher-demand regime and avoid diluting with the two low Jan samples. I match sigma_hat to the same recent window (N=12) so uncertainty reflects current volatility. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the confirmed higher demand while accounting for the long pipeline to avoid over-ordering and high holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has been consistently high since the regime shift starting 2019-01-21; on-hand=44, in-transit=908 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock to the confirmed value=4. For demand I use recent_N (last 12 periods) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime and avoid diluting with the very low early samples; sigma_hat also uses recent_N (N=12) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with the current high-demand regime while recognizing abundant pipeline inventory to limit new ordering and holding costs.

On-hand=77, in-transit=849 \u2014 ample pipeline but demand volatility persists. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use calculated L to reflect observed lead times.

Demand experienced a sustained upward regime starting 2019-01-21 and recent periods show high, variable weekly demand; to capture the recent regime I use recent_N=20 to estimate demand over the review+lead horizon, while keeping lead time as default (promised=4, which matches observed). Using recent_N for sigma captures current volatility and lets the OR engine size base-stock and cap appropriately given the higher mean and variance, balancing service and holding cost given Profit=$19 and Holding=$1.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent history shows stable observed lead time = 4 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime established from 2019-01-21 onward. On-hand = 554, in-transit = 438 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is ample vs recent weekly demand (recent weeks 50\u2013135). I choose L=default to use the promised/observed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to let the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean over the most recent regime samples (captures the post-2019-01-21 elevated demand while smoothing recent declines). I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=20) so safety stock reflects recent volatility rather than long-ago low-demand noise. These settings keep service high while avoiding excessive hold given large current inventory.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent on-hand=805, in-transit=197 \u2014 ample coverage versus recent low summer demand. Historical concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Demand has fallen from spring peaks; recent weeks (Periods 21-24 demands = 103,84,50,43) show a lower summer regime. I set L by calculate to let backend use observed lead times (matches confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the recent downshift while smoothing weekly noise; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to estimate recent volatility. These settings reduce target base stock relative to spring peaks, lowering holding cost while preserving service given strong on-hand+pipeline.

Period 26 (2019-08-05): on-hand=771, in-transit=197. Historical concludes show a sustained higher-demand regime since 2019-01-21 and observed lead times consistently 4 periods. On-hand + pipeline is ample vs recent weekly demand, but to keep service while avoiding excess stock I use estimated lead time from observations and base demand on the recent high-demand regime. Set L by calculating average observed lead times (reflects confirmed 4-period LT). Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std), balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=19 and holding=1.

To avoid excess holding cost while respecting confirmed lead time, use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates (uses full-sample mean scaled by 1+L). This keeps OR backend conservative (no extra uplift) given high on-hand + pipeline and prevents further overstocking.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent demand has settled to low weekly levels (Period21-27 demands: 103,84,50,43,34,24,22) after earlier spike; on-hand=869, in-transit=129 \u2014 ample cover vs. recent demand. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. I set L=default (promised 4) to align with observed confirmations. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the post-spike low-demand regime (Periods 21\u201327) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current lower mean and variability over the most relevant 7 weeks; this keeps base-stock moderate to avoid excessive holding cost while preserving service. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments are needed now since arrivals have been consistent at lead time 4.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). On-hand=895, in-transit=76. Historical concluded arrivals show a stable actual lead time of 4 periods and recent demand has been low (periods ~21-28 showing weekly demand mostly 20-50). To keep orders aligned with recent summer demand and avoid excess holding cost, set lead time to be inferred from observations (calculate). Forecast demand using the most recent 10 samples to capture the current low-demand regime (recent_N, N=10). Use recent_N N=10 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstating mean/variance from early high-demand weeks and balance service level vs holding cost given high on-hand.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has settled to low weekly levels after the early-year spike; last 9 concluded demands (Periods 21-29) average \u224849 units/week. On-hand=856, in-transit=76 \u2192 ample coverage vs recent demand; no overdue shipments visible. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use calculated L to reflect observed data. To keep orders responsive to the current lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (uses the last 9 demand samples ~Periods 21-29). This reduces forecast bias from the early spike and lowers target base-stock, balancing high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1).

Inventory is very high vs recent demand; avoid increasing forecast/volatility estimates. Choose L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses all historical demand data scaled by (1+L); this keeps orders conservative given large on-hand and high profit:holding ratio (encourages service but backend cap limits order size).

For demand I use recent_N (N=8) because the last 8 periods (P25\u2013P32) show a new low-demand regime (avg \u224826.75/week); using recent data focuses the (1+L) forecast on current steady demand and avoids inflation from early high peaks. Sigma set recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago spikes.

No new evidence of lead-time changes; previous history shows consistent 4-period arrivals. To avoid overstocking given high on-hand, use promised lead time and base forecasts from the most recent short-term demand (reduce mu_hat to recent mean). Selected methods: L=default to keep promised 4; mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture current low-demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent low volatility. This reduces ordering aggressiveness and balances service vs holding cost while pipeline is zero and inventory is ample.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand = 839, in-transit = 0; recent weekly demand has been low (Periods 29\u201335: 39,48,9,11,9,9,7) indicating a sustained lower-demand regime vs earlier peaks. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) to capture the recent low-demand regime (reduces ordering to avoid excess holding). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=8) to match volatility to the same recent window. These parameters will lower the base-stock to better balance service vs holding given high on-hand and no in-transit units.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=833, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand is low and stable (periods 28-36: 27,39,48,9,11,9,9,7,6), well below the early-2019 spike. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods. I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed = 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=10) to focus the forecast and variability on the most recent low-demand regime so the OR backend reduces replenishment and holding cost while preserving service. This balances profit vs holding by shrinking forecast and uncertainty to recent demand levels given large on-hand inventory and zero pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Current on-hand=827, in-transit=0; demand has been low & stable recently after earlier high-volatility months. Observed lead times from concluded history average 4 periods (consistent with earlier confirmation). To avoid overstock given high on-hand and low recent demand, set L to calculated (uses observed avg). Use recent_N=9 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (last 9 demand samples from Period29-37) to capture the recent low-demand regime and lower volatility so OR backend reduces order quantity and holding cost exposure.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04): recent demand is low and stable (Periods 31-38 demands = 9,11,9,9,7,6,6,6) after earlier high-volatility months. On-hand=821, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock now, so forecast should use the recent low-demand regime. Lead time historically confirms 4 periods (sustained observations P5-P28). I set L to calculate (use observed lead times average) and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the replenishment on the last 8 low-demand samples, reducing inventory risk while maintaining service level.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=813, in-transit=0; recent demand has been low (mostly single digits since Period 29) so we need (1+L)-period forecast based on recent regime. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period lead time \u2014 use calculated lead time. To avoid overstocking from early high-demand weeks, set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 20 demand samples to capture the current low-demand regime and reduced volatility. This keeps base_stock tuned to current demand while L=4 ensures pipeline coverage; smaller recent-based \u03bc\u0302 reduces holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Current on-hand=805, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock vs recent low weekly demand (~6-9/week across recent months). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period actual lead time; no recent missing shipments. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised/observed lead time and stable low demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from all samples). This favors minimizing holding cost while preserving service given large on-hand.

Historic concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and recent demand has fallen to a low, stable regime (weekly sales \u22486\u20139 over many recent periods). To avoid overstock while preserving service, use promised lead time (default) and base forecasts on the most recent stable regime: use recent_N (N=12) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the recent low-demand window.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded-history, so use calculated lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 12 samples to reflect the current low-demand regime and avoid overstock growth. This keeps the base-stock sized to meet expected demand over the review+lead horizon while limiting holding cost drag given already-large on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=785, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been persistently low since late summer (many periods of 6\u20139 units/week), so I bias forecasts to the recent low-demand regime. Actual lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods, so I keep the default promised lead time. I choose recent_N for demand mean and volatility using the most recent regime (last 15 samples) to reflect the sustained lower-demand pattern and avoid overstocking. This keeps base_stock smaller (reducing holding cost) while still covering (1+L) periods of expected demand given the confirmed L=4.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Demand has been in a low, stable regime since mid\u20102019 (recent weekly demand ~2\u20139) after the spring spike; no evidence of a new upward shift. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To avoid excess future stock while maintaining service, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the last stable periods (reducing overreaction to the spring spike). This reduces target base-stock and cap, lowering holding cost risk given large on-hand inventory.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent demand has been low and stable (periods 29\u201346 mostly single-digit weekly sales); on-hand = 779, in-transit = 0, so inventory is ample. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4. To avoid over-ordering given high holding cost relative to demand, use promised/default lead time and base demand forecast from the recent stable regime. I choose recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the latest low-variance demand pattern while keeping L as default (promised 4). This keeps the OR base-stock conservative (low \u03bc\u0302) to minimize holding costs while satisfying typical low weekly demand.
