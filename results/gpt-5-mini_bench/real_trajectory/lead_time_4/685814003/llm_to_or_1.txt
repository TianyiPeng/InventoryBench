Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals. Historical weekly samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) mean=78.0. Promised lead time=4 periods. Profit=1 and holding=1 \u2192 service quantile q=0.5 (z*=0) so base_stock \u2248 mu_hat. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates based on all samples to cover review+lead (1+L)=5 periods: default mu_hat => 5\xd7mean of all samples. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical variability. This balances service (meet demand over 5 periods) while avoiding extra safety since q=0.5.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=125 (order placed P1). No concluded arrivals yet so cannot infer actual lead time; use promised lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) show no sustained changepoint. Set L=default to use promised 4-period lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to base forecast on all 5 available demand samples (captures current short-run mean including latest week). Use sigma_hat default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (using recent mean) against holding cost while awaiting confirmed arrivals.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). On-hand=0, in-transit=244 (orders from P1+P2); no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time cannot be confirmed\u2014orders may still be en route. Historical weekly demand samples mean=78, std~25 (samples: 75,51,57,123,84). Promised lead time retained (default) due to lack of confirmed arrivals. Use default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)*mean = 5*78=390 target coverage; current pipeline (244) is below that target, so the engine will order to top up. Profit and holding equal, so backend will set service quantile; defaults balance service vs holding given limited evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=377. Historical demand samples (5): mean=78 units/week. No concluded arrivals yet for orders placed in Periods 1-3; insufficient evidence to confirm lead-time change or lost shipments (promised L=4, arrivals would not be visible until later). Use default promised lead time to avoid overreacting. Set L=default so backend uses promised L=4; mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (=5\xd778=390) capturing expected demand over review+lead; sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples (propagates observed variability). This balances service level versus holding cost while preserving caution given delayed/unknown arrivals.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Historical weekly demand mean = 78 (samples: 75,51,57,123,84). On-hand=0, in-transit=382, and four consecutive conclude messages show arrived=0 for prior orders \u2192 evidence of delayed/lost arrivals but no concluded lead-time to compute a new average. To avoid over-adjusting from unconfirmed lead-time shifts, use promised lead time (default) and historical demand average scaled by (1+L). This provides mu_hat that covers review+lead demand and lets the OR backend balance service vs holding costs given equal profit and holding ($1 each). Sigma left as default to reflect historical variability.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 have not concluded (arrived=0 across four consecutive concludes); in-transit reported 382 units \u2014 possible delayed or lost shipments requiring monitoring.

Daily Reward (R_t): $15.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concludes confirm an actual lead time of 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5 => lead_time=4). On-hand=55, in-transit=257; earlier concludes showed multiple periods with arrivals=0 but one arrival now confirms lead time=4 rather than longer. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (consistent with confirmed 4). Demand historical mean = 78/week; with (1+L)=5 the default forecast covers 5 periods -> use mu_hat='default' to let backend compute (1+L)*mean and remain aligned with long-run samples. Use sigma_hat='default' so backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service (use confirmed lead time, full-sample demand estimate) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-25. On-hand=147, in-transit=196 (matches P3=133, P4=5, P6=58 pending). Observed concluded arrivals: P1->P5 and P2->P6 => actual lead time consistent with 4 periods. No sustained demand regime shift detected; recent demands (P5=70, P6=27) are within historical variability. Use lead-time inference via calculate (average observed lead times = 4) and default demand stats so backend computes base-stock from full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L). This balances service (confirmed L=4) without overreacting to short recent dips, and avoids excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived Period5; Period2 order arrived Period6).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). On-hand=262, in-transit=69. Concluded history shows three observed arrivals with lead_time=4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7) so actual lead time is confirmed at 4 periods. Use L=calculate to lock in observed lead time. Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples (historical mean=78 \u2192 implied (1+4)\xd778=390 demand across review+lead). This keeps a conservative base-stock given equal profit and holding cost and the confirmed 4-period lead time, helping buffer against prior missing/delayed shipments while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1/unit/period.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). On-hand=242, in-transit=64. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived at P5\u2013P8), so no persistent loss signal now. Demand has softened in the most recent concluded periods (Period5-8 demands = 70,27,18,25); I use a recent window to capture this regime. Set L via calculate to lock in observed lead time=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N N=4 (last 4 concluded demand samples) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std based on the recent lower-demand regime\u2014this reduces ordering aggressiveness and limits holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent concludes show actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals for orders placed P1\u2013P4). On-hand = 227, in-transit = 64; pipeline plus on-hand adequate vs. recent low weekly demand (historical sample mean = 78/week). I use lead-time inference from observed concludes (calculate) to lock L=4, and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service (use confirmed L) while avoiding unnecessary extra stock given modest demand and equal profit/holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent realised demand has fallen sharply vs. earlier historical samples (recent weeks mostly teens-to-20s). On-hand=266, in-transit=10 (no large pending arrivals expected). Actual lead time has been observed as 4 in concludes. To avoid overstock given low recent demand, set L by calculation (uses observed lead times). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new low-demand regime (last 5 demands: 27,18,25,15,19). This reduces target base-stock and limits fresh receipts while preserving service given profit=holding cost parity.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical mean ~78 (Jan samples) vs. recent 5-period mean ~20.8 (Periods 6-10), drop \u2248 -73%; record as sustained (5 periods of low demand).

Daily Reward (R_t): $-228.00

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has settled at a lower regime: Periods 6-10 demands = [27,18,25,15,19] with 5-period mean \u224820.8 vs. historical Jan mean \u224878 (\u2248-73%). On-hand=250, in-transit=4 \u2014 ample on-hand stock today; no incoming batches pending aside from 4 units. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the 4-period reality. Because demand regime has shifted and is sustained for 5 periods, I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current low-demand regime, avoiding overordering given high holding cost equal to profit ($1 each). This reduces base-stock and caps ordering to preserve profit while minimizing holding penalties.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=212, in-transit=4. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Demand has shifted down since early periods; recent 5-period demand is low and stable (~20\u201324/week). To reflect confirmed LT=4 and the recent low-demand regime, set L by calculation from observed lead times and set demand forecast/volatility from the most recent 5 weeks to avoid overweighting the earlier high-Jan samples. This reduces over-ordering and holding cost while preserving service given current demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=192, in-transit=4. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). Recent demand regime has dropped and stabilized over ~5 periods (Periods 6-10 avg \u224820.8 vs historical Jan mean \u224878). To avoid excess holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/unit), I use a lead-time estimate based on observed arrives and base demand on the most recent 5 periods to reflect the sustained low-demand regime; same recent window for volatility so OR backend sizes orders conservatively and avoids replenishing to the old higher mean.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=174, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11, P10\u2192P14) \u2014 no recent lost shipments. Demand has exhibited a sustained downward regime since Period 6 (noted Period 11 insight: recent 5-period mean \u224820.8 vs historical ~78). To reflect confirmed lead time and the lower recent demand, set L by averaging observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (regime length=5) so the OR engine plans to stock for the lower-demand regime and avoids excess holding cost given equal profit and holding=$1/unit.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent demand has been in a lower regime since Period 11 (5-period recent mean = 22.8 units/week for Periods 12-16). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes and matches the promised LT, so keep promised LT. To align the OR base-stock with the sustained lower demand, set demand forecast using the recent 5 periods (N=5). Use the same recent window for volatility (N=5) so the backend's base_stock balances service level against holding cost given profit=holding_cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=126, in-transit=0. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 (arrivals from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.) and there are no outstanding in-transit shipments. Demand has undergone a sustained downward regime: recent 5-period demands (Periods 13\u201317) = [20,22,12,22,14], recent mean \u224818 (\u2248-73% vs. historical Jan mean ~78). To avoid overstock while preserving service, I use the promised/confirmed L=4 and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime. I select recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility, reducing orders to match the lower demand and lowering holding cost exposure.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Current on-hand=118, in-transit=0; no pending arrivals visible. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods repeatedly. Demand has been in a low regime since Period 6 (recent 10 weeks show low weekly demand vs. historical Jan samples). To avoid overstock given Profit=Holding ($1/$1) and sustained low demand, set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent low-demand regime while the OR backend computes base-stock and caps accordingly. This avoids assuming high historical Jan demand and reduces ordering risk given zero in-transit and no new conclude signals.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=113, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has been persistently low since Period 6 (sustained low regime previously recorded), so use recent data to set demand estimate. Promised lead time has been confirmed historically as 4 periods; keep L=default to match contract. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=11) to capture the most recent 11 weeks of demand and reflect the lower demand regime, reducing unnecessary ordering. Set sigma_hat using recent_N (N=11) to estimate variability from the same recent window to avoid overstating safety stock. These choices lower target base stock to preserve profit vs. holding cost given holding cost equals profit (q=0.5), while using recent observations to remain responsive to the sustained low-demand regime.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent sustained low-demand regime since Period 6 (many periods averaging ~20 units) vs. historical Jan mean ~78. On-hand=54, in-transit=0; no recent arrivals outstanding. To reflect the sustained low-demand regime I set lead time to promised default (4) because concluded history repeatedly shows LT=4, and use recent_N=15 for demand mean/volatility to capture the full low-demand regime (Periods 6\u201320). This reduces planned replenishment vs. legacy high-Jan mean and prevents excess holding given equal profit and holding costs (q=0.5 -> moderate service target).

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

Recent demand has been lower than Jan historical levels but shows a recent spike (last 5 demands: 14,8,5,59,98) \u2014 to balance responsiveness to the recent spike while de-emphasizing older winter data, set mu_hat using a recent_N=5 mean (covers the most recent regime including the jump). Keep sigma_hat at default to let backend use full-sample volatility scaled for (1+L). This combination reduces overstock risk from winter means while allowing the policy to react to the latest demand increase and the small in-transit quantity.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=137. Historical data and concluded messages have repeatedly confirmed actual lead time = 4 earlier; recent concludes show orders from Periods 21\u201322 not yet arrived but only two missed-conclude periods (not yet a sustained lost-shipment pattern). Demand regime shifted down around Period 11 and has persisted; to avoid overstock I use a recent-window demand estimate. Choices: L set to promised (default=4) since concludes historically confirm 4 and no strong evidence to change; mu_hat use recent_N to reflect the low-demand regime (N=12 covering Periods 11\u201322); sigma_hat use recent_N with same N=12 to capture recent volatility. These settings reduce target base-stock to match the sustained lower demand while keeping lead-time assumption consistent with observed concludes, limiting risk of ordering into delayed/lost shipments.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): on-hand=0, in-transit=170. Recent 3 concluded periods (P21-23) show high demand (98,87,65) with stockouts each period, indicating a new higher-demand regime vs prior low-demand run. Historical observed lead times have been 4 periods; use calculated average to reflect confirmed pattern. To respond to the recent uptick, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N on the most recent 3 periods to capture the new mean and volatility; this increases target base-stock to reduce imminent stockouts while relying on L=calculate so arrivals align with observed 4-period lead time. No new evidence that in-transit shipments are lost (they're still reported), so parameters assume they will arrive per inferred lead time.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 21: avg demand P21-23 = 83.3 vs prior recent 5-period avg ~20.8 (+300%); sustained for 3 periods

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent weeks (Periods 21-24) show a clear demand uplift vs earlier low-demand regime (demands: 98,87,65,30); prior carry-over already recorded this regime shift starting Period 21. On-hand=0, in-transit=281; promised lead time remains 4 and recent concluded history confirmed LT=4 earlier, and there is not yet enough overdue evidence to mark shipments lost. I set L to default (promised=4). For demand I target the new higher regime using recent_N on the last 4 periods (regime length=4) so mu_hat uses recent_N N=4 and sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to reflect recent mean and volatility and to keep the base-stock responsive to the July demand spike while the pipeline (281) provides intermediate coverage.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=306. Recent demand (Periods 21-25) = [98,87,65,30,58], 5-period mean=67.6, indicating the higher-demand regime noted starting Period 21 remains active. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes; use promised/default L. To capture the new higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (Periods 21-25) so the OR engine stocks to meet the (1+L) review+lead demand under current volatility while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand periods. This balances service (protect against stockouts given on-hand=0 and sizeable in-transit) vs holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent demand increased starting Period 21 (sustained spike recorded P21-23) and remaining volatile through P26 (demands: P21-26 = 98,87,65,30,58,117). Actual lead time has been observed as 4 in prior concludes. On-hand=0, in-transit=245 (some shipments recently concluded so pipeline exists). To capture the new, higher demand regime I set L to promised (default=4) and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecasts on the most recent 6 periods (P21\u2013P26), which balances responsiveness to the regime shift while providing enough sample size to estimate variability. This increases target base stock to better cover (L+1) periods of elevated demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current volatility so the OR backend can size safety stock appropriately.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=340 units (multiple concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead time). Recent demand has elevated since Period 21 (P21-27: 98,87,65,30,58,117,154) indicating a new higher-demand regime; use a recent-window forecast to capture this shift. Set L by calculation to reflect observed lead times (observed = 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=7) to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over the last 7 demand samples, which balances responsiveness to the detected regime shift while preserving stability. This helps the OR backend raise the base stock to meet higher demand while controlling holding cost by using a limited recent window.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=9, in-transit=324 provides pipeline cover but recent high demand warrants forecasting from the recent regime. I set L to default (promised 4) since concluded history confirms it. I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the latest high-demand regime, improving service while avoiding over-reaction to older low-demand periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Current on-hand=11, in-transit=367. Historical Jan mean \u224878 but a clear regime change began Period 21 with elevated demand (P21-29 demands: 98,87,65,30,58,117,154,102,67 \u2014 recent regime average \u224899.6). Lead-time evidence: multiple concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead time. Some earlier missing shipments occurred (Periods 1\u20134) but subsequent patterns (Period5 onward) show reliable 4-period arrivals. To adapt the OR backend to the sustained higher-demand regime while respecting promised lead time and accounting for past delays, set L to default (promised=4), set mu_hat using recent_N to capture the new higher mean (use last 9 demand samples covering the post-changepoint regime), and set sigma_hat using recent_N with the same N to reflect recent volatility. This raises the base-stock to meet the elevated demand while preserving cap constraints and avoiding excess safety stock from older high-variance history.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=390. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple orders observed arriving after 4). Recent demand has rebounded: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 26-30) = [117,154,102,67,108], mean \u2248109.6, showing a sustained higher-demand regime versus earlier low-demand periods. To reflect confirmed LT=4 and recent high demand, set L by calculation (uses observed lead times=4). Forecast demand across review+lead using recent 5 periods to capture current regime (mu_hat recent_N N=5). Use sigma_hat recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility. These settings supply the OR backend with a higher base-stock aligned to recent demand while keeping variance estimate tuned to recent variability; with profit=holding cost, target service level is 50%, so we avoid excessive safety stock beyond recent demand patterns. Pipeline (390 units) should cover several periods of demand (~3.5 periods at ~110/week); no immediate additional safety ordering required beyond OR output.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods repeatedly; recent demand has seen regime shifts but with mixed signals (some high weeks in Jul\u2013Sep and low earlier). Given large in-transit pipeline and confirmed LT=4, use default lead time to match promised. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history\u2014this balances service level using all data while the large pipeline already provides coverage against short-term spikes. Monitoring of in-transit remains necessary for lost/delayed shipments.

Demand increased starting Period 21 and has persisted through Period 32; to capture this sustained higher-demand regime I use a recent-window demand estimate. Set L by calculating observed lead times to match confirmed LT=4. Use recent_N (N=12, P21\u2013P32) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the resumed higher-demand regime and recent volatility.

Lead time has repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use calculated lead time. For demand forecast use recent data to capture the sustained high-demand regime (use recent_N with last 6 periods to reflect current weekly sales pattern). Use recent_N for sigma to measure volatility in the same recent window. These choices prioritize matching base-stock to the higher recent demand while relying on observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering or overstocking given significant pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=436. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 consistently; earlier missing shipments have since resolved. Demand regime increased starting ~Period 21 (sustained higher demand through Periods 21-34, recent spikes including Period 34 demand=210). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I set L=default (use promised 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the recent high-demand regime; N chosen to cover the recent regime length (~14 weeks) so the base-stock will reflect current higher mean and volatility and avoid stockouts while keeping holding costs in mind.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; on-hand=91, in-transit=356 (large pipeline). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 21 with recent volatility \u2014 I use a short recent window to capture current pace. I set L to default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent 5 weeks of demand (captures recent high-demand regime and short-term variability). This keeps the OR base-stock responsive while the large in-transit reduces upside ordering risk given equal profit and holding costs.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent demand has rebounded from the low regime (Periods 6-10) to much higher weekly demand in the last 5 periods (P32-36 demand = 115,105,210,67,60; recent mean \u2248111.4). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods across many concluded arrivals (multiple P\u2192P+4 confirms). Current inventory: on-hand=31, in-transit=527 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent demand (~111/wk). To capture the recent high-demand regime while respecting observed lead time and the large pipeline, I set L by calculating the average observed lead time (confirming 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent N=5 samples (captures the current high-demand regime over the last 5 weeks and matches review+lead aggregation (1+L)=5). This raises the backend base-stock to cover the present high-demand level while sigma from recent variability tunes safety stock; using recent_N avoids diluting the forecast with the older low-demand regime. Large existing in-transit reduces immediate order quantities in the OR engine via pipeline subtraction.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=100, in-transit=384 \u2014 strong pipeline coverage. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; no recent evidence of further shift. Recent demand has been higher and more volatile (Periods 33-37: 105,210,67,60,74) so I use a recent-window forecast to capture current regime. Choose L=default to keep promised lead time (4) since concludes match promise. mu_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the last 5 realized weekly demands, capturing the recent higher-mean regime. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep service targeted to current demand while avoiding overstating uncertainty; with on-hand + in-transit large, orders will be conservative.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=205, in-transit=281. Historical lead time repeatedly observed as 4 periods (confirmed in concludes); no sustained new lead-time signal, so use promised/default L. Recent demand shows elevated/volatile weekly sales (Periods 34-38 demand = [210,67,60,74,30], recent 5-mean \u224888). To balance service (profit=holding, so q=0.5) I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the latest regime while keeping sigma from the full-sample to avoid overfitting to one spike. This helps the OR backend size base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of current demand while not overreacting to the single large spike at P34. On-hand + in-transit (486 units) already provides substantial coverage, so parameters prioritize matching recent demand rather than inflating safety stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=124, in-transit=203 (pipeline total=327). Historical lead time has repeatedly been 4 periods (confirmed in prior concludes) and recent arrivals show no new sustained delays; therefore use promised lead time. Demand has recent volatility (including a large spike in Period 39) but the long-run mean (~78 from available samples) remains a reasonable anchor; no sustained new demand regime since last recorded insight. To let the OR backend compute safety stock and cap with its statistics, I select default methods so it uses the promised L=4 and the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L). This balances service level for intermittent spikes while avoiding unnecessary explicit increases in forecast that could raise holding costs.

Recent demand (Periods 34-40) shows elevated and volatile sales vs the long-run Jan samples, so I bias forecasts toward the recent regime. Set L to default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand level and volatility (balances service vs holding cost by reacting to the recent uptick while keeping cap on orders).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=0, in-transit=265. Historical lead times consistently observed at 4 periods (many concluded Pn\u2192Pn+4), so use promised lead time. Recent demand has been elevated and volatile: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 37-41) = [74,30,159,190,205], recent 5-period mean \u2248131.6 which is materially higher than older low-demand regime. To make the OR engine responsive to the current demand regime while limiting reliance on long-ago low-demand samples, I use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std. This keeps service during the current high-demand run while capping order size via the engine's cap parameter. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments because lead time remains 4 in concluded history and in-transit balance (265) will be considered by the backend pipeline calculation.

Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=490 (matches outstanding orders from P41=231 + P42=257 \u2248488). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period lead time (multiple P->P+4 confirms). Recent demand has jumped sharply in the last 5 concluded periods (P38-P42). To reflect confirmed LT=4 and capture the new high-demand regime while limiting excess holding, set L to promised (default) and use recent-5 demand statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine targets a base-stock appropriate to the elevated short-term demand while keeping volatility estimated from the same window.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 38: avg demand P38-42 = 197.6 (30,159,190,205,404), sustained 5 periods; record as new high-demand regime.

Recent demand spike persists around Periods 38-42 (demands: 30,159,190,205,404) with Period 43 demand=73; to be responsive to the recent high-demand regime I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 concluded demand samples) so the OR base-stock covers the review+lead horizon. L kept at promised (default) because concluded history confirms 4. Sigma estimated from the same recent 5-sample window to reflect current volatility and avoid under-ordering during the high-demand regime. No new sustained lead-time or demand regime changes beyond those already recorded.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=0, in-transit=1029. Recent concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent P1->P5, P2->P6, ... P40->P44). Demand has risen into a high regime: last 5 concluded demands (Periods 40-44) = [190,205,404,73,129], 5-period mean \u2248 200.2 and high volatility. To match the OR engine's (1+L)-period forecast and capture the new high-demand regime, set L by calculating observed lead times (will yield 4), use a recent_N=5 mean for mu_hat to target current regime, and use recent_N=5 for sigma_hat to reflect elevated volatility. This balances service (avoid stockouts given heavy recent demand) against holding cost by basing parameters on the most recent high-demand samples while relying on confirmed lead-time observations.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent history confirms a sustained high-demand regime starting Period 38 (Periods 38-45 show elevated demand; recent 5-period avg \u2248 189.6). On-hand=94, in-transit=798 so pipeline is large; still need forecast over (1+L) periods. Set L=default (promised 4 periods) because multiple concludes confirm 4-period actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecast/volatility to the current high-demand regime (captures recent mean/variance and avoids dilution from earlier low-demand periods). This biases the OR base-stock upward to prioritize service during the high-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N limits overreaction to older variability. Monitoring for lost shipments continues but no new sustained lead-time or regime change since Period 43.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand regime is the high-demand regime that started around Period 38 (P38-42 avg ~197.6) and persists through the last 5 concluded periods (P42-46). On-hand=240, in-transit=597 \u2014 substantial pipeline that will cover several weeks of elevated demand; no evidence of lost shipments for recent orders (many P-arrivals at LT=4). I keep L as default (promised 4) because concluded messages consistently show 4-period arrivals. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime (use the last 5 concluded demand samples) so the OR engine targets a base-stock appropriate for the new higher mean while sigma reflects recent volatility. This avoids overreacting to older low-demand history and aligns ordering with observed high demand; given heavy pipeline, the capped order will naturally limit new receipts and reduce holding cost risk.
