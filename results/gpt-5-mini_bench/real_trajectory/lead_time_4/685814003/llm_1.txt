With no evidence yet of lead-time deviations or lost orders, plan to cover expected demand for next 5 periods: 5 * 78 = 390 units. Balance vs. holding cost: holding cost equals profit, so I avoid excess safety stock beyond covering the (L+1)-period expected demand.

Game history: Period1 demand=49, Period2=123 \u2014 high variance but no sustained shift (only two recent periods). Use a conservative mid/high short-term demand estimate ~80\u2013100 units/week. c) Lead time vs missing orders: Promised lead time is 4 periods. The only order (390 units placed in Period1) has not concluded yet; this is expected (would arrive during Period5 if actual lead time = promised 4). No evidence of lost shipment or reduced lead time. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand=0, In-transit=390. Pipeline of 390 likely covers ~4\u20135 weeks at 80\u2013100/wk (390/80\u22484.9, 390/100=3.9).
