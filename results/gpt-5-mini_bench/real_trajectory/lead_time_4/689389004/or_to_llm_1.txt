======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed as 4 periods from history (Period1\u2192P5, P3\u2192P7, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=184, in-transit=0. Demand outlook: historical sample mean=75.2 (OR uses this), but a sustained lower-demand regime was previously recorded (Period12\u201317 avg \u224832.7 and subsequent weeks remain low: recent weekly demand mostly 9\u201317). Profit and holding cost equal ($1), so critical fractile=0.5 \u2192 no safety stock premium. OR recommended 69 units based on promised lead time and historical mean, but with confirmed L=4 and high on-hand that already covers multiple (L+1)=5 periods of expected low demand, placing more stock increases holding cost without meaningful sales upside. Therefore order 0 units to avoid excess holding costs and because no in-transit stock is needed given current on-hand relative to observed lower demand.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Override OR's 69\u21920: confirmed 4-period lead time and sustained lower demand plus on-hand=184 (enough for many weeks) \u2014 avoid extra holding cost.",
