Decision logic: Because of the 4-period lead time, an order placed now cannot satisfy demand for the next 4 periods; we must balance risk of over-ordering (incurring $1/ unit/period holding cost and possible lost/unit markdowns later) against risk of stockouts once the order arrives. We have no concluded arrivals yet to confirm a lead-time deviation or lost shipments, so do not assume earlier arrival. The OR recommendation of 30 equals the cap designed to limit switching volatility; it provides a modest replenishment that limits holding cost exposure while beginning to build pipeline for when supply eventually arrives. Given limited evidence (small historical sample, no confirmed lead-time change, high expected demand over 5 periods but large uncertainty about future regime and lost shipments), I accept OR's capped recommendation rather than placing a much larger order that could create high holding cost if demand softens or shipment is lost. Action: order 30 units.",

Recent sustained demand regime is very low: Periods 42\u201346 demands = 17,2,5,6,6 (most recent five weeks average \u22487.2/wk) and earlier carry-over shows sustained low regime since Period 43 (avg \u22489.8 then falling).
