Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 1 (2019-02-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised 4. Historical weekly demand mean=22 (samples: 20,26,22,27,15) and variance modest. To ensure (L+1)=5 periods coverage and because no changepoint or delayed shipments observed, use defaults: L=promised, mu_hat=(1+L)*mean of all samples, sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This balances service level versus holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent observed weekly demands (historical sample set) average ~22 units/week (samples: 20,26,22,27,15) and Period 1 demand was 19 \u2014 no sustained shift detected. On-hand=0, in-transit=30; promised lead time is 4 periods and there are no concluded arrivals yet (Period 1 order arrived=0), so no evidence actual lead time differs. Pipeline (30) is well below the (L+1)-period expected demand (~5\xd722=110), so we should use the default promised lead time and lifecycle-wide demand estimates to let the OR engine compute a base-stock covering typical demand and safety stock. Therefore set L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat to default methods so the backend uses all-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L).

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=59. Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrivals have been observed yet (Period 1 and 2 orders show arrived=0, which is expected given L=4). Recent demand history (historical samples) available but no sustained changepoint: use defaults so OR backend applies promised L and full-sample demand statistics. This keeps parameters conservative given pipeline stock and avoids overreacting to two recent high-demand observations.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=98 (sum of prior orders 30+29+39). Historical weekly demand samples mean\u224822 (samples: 20,26,22,27,15). No concluded arrivals yet\u2014shipments still in-transit (possible normal lead time >= promised). Pipeline (98) is slightly below the (1+L)*mean demand target (~110 for L=4), so let the OR backend use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats to compute replenishment. Methods chosen: use default promised L to avoid overfitting to unconfirmed lead-time shifts; use all historical samples for mu_hat and sigma_hat to provide a stable forecast for the OR engine.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Historical demand samples avg=22 units/week (samples: 20,26,22,27,15). Four consecutive conclude messages (P1\u2013P4) show ordered units but arrived=0, indicating promised lead time (4) is not being met or shipments are lost. To be conservative I increase lead time to avoid over-ordering into an unseen pipeline and set mu_hat to cover the longer review+lead window: (1+L)*mean = 9*22 = 198 units. sigma_hat left as default so the OR backend scales observed volatility by sqrt(1+L). These choices reduce the risk of placing orders that will never arrive quickly while ensuring enough units are ordered to cover the extended horizon and balance profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 did not arrive (arrived=0 for P1\u2013P4), suggesting actual lead time > promised 4 periods or lost shipments (sustained for 4 periods).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Concluded arrivals show an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 (lead_time=4) \u2014 so actual lead time confirmed at 4. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 1\u20135) averages 32 units vs historical sample mean 22, a sustained increase; pipeline (on-hand 0 + in-transit 149) is slightly below a (1+L)-period forecast given the higher recent mean, so we should target the new regime. Therefore: set L by 'calculate' (uses observed lead times -> 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime and recent volatility.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: historical sample mean=22 (Jan samples) -> recent Periods 1\u20135 mean=32 (+45%), sustained over 5 periods.

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded arrivals show orders from P1->P5 and P2->P6, implying actual lead time = 4. Demand has shifted up (recent 5-period mean \u224832 vs historical mean 22). On-hand=0, in-transit=149. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed actual lead time. For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime; same N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters steer the OR backend to raise base-stock to cover (1+L) periods at the new demand level while recognizing updated lead time and recent variability.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (orders: P1 -> P5 arrived, P2 -> P6 arrived).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7) and a sustained demand increase: recent Periods 1\u20135 avg demand \u224832 vs historical Jan mean 22 (+45%). On-hand=0, in-transit=150 (covers several future periods). I set L=calculate to use observed lead times (avg observed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher regime (use (1+L)*mean of last 5 samples). For sigma I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet higher demand while using recent volatility to avoid excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 (service emphasis but capped order will limit over-ordering).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Recent demand has risen sharply (last 5 demands: 27,32,36,53,85; mean \u224846.6) vs historical mean \u224822. On-hand=0, in-transit=162 (orders from P5\u2013P8). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed arrivals P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.), so use observed lead time. To capture the sustained demand regime shift, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (captures current higher mean and volatility). These parameters will raise the base stock to improve service through the lead time while sigma_hat recent_N reflects increased variability, limiting over-ordering.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has risen materially versus historical Jan baseline (historical mean=22; recent periods show elevated demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=210 (covers multiple future arrivals given confirmed 4-period lead time). Lead times observed in concluded periods are consistently 4, so set L to the calculated average of observed lead times. To capture the recent higher-demand regime, use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 demand samples (captures the sustained upward shift while keeping estimates responsive). This balances service (higher mu_hat raises base stock) against holding cost by limiting the lookback to recent data rather than the low historical mean.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has increased sharply beyond historical Jan samples: last 5 periods demand = [36,53,85,77,129], mean=76, indicating a new high-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=277 (pipeline healthy but demand run-rate is high). Lead time observations (concluded arrivals) consistently show 4-period arrivals; use observed-average. Set L via calculate to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the new high-demand regime over the most recent 5 periods (covers review+lead scaling). Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture elevated volatility from the same recent window. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher base-stock to avoid stockouts given strong recent demand while letting the backend cap orders per its safety-cap formula.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. On-hand=0, in-transit=372. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (orders P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use calculated lead time. Demand has shifted sharply upward starting Period 7 (recent demands: 53,85,77,129,184) \u2014 I treat the last 5 periods as the new regime when forecasting. Therefore set L by calculate (uses observed lead times), set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the current high-demand regime and recent volatility. This biases orders toward meeting much larger near-term demand while the OR backend will cap orders via its cap rule to limit overstock given holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 7: avg demand increased from 22 (historical Jan samples) to 105.6 (Periods 7\u201311 mean = 105.6), +380%, sustained for 5 periods.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has shifted up and is sustained: periods 7\u201312 demands = [53,85,77,129,184,111], mean=106.5. Observed concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=508 which is slightly below (1+L)*recent mean demand (5*106.5=532.5) so pipeline nearly covers the review+lead demand but is marginally short. Set L by calculate to confirm observed LT=4; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet higher demand while controlling holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13): recent demand has been much higher than historical Jan samples (last 5 demands = 77,129,184,111,79; mean=116). On-hand=7, in-transit=534 \u2014 pipeline is large and with promised lead time=4 this coverage meets (1+L) demand for the short term. Actual lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes. I therefore keep L as default (promised=4). To capture the recent high-demand regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 (reflecting the last 5 observed demands) and set sigma_hat to recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These choices steer the OR engine to a base-stock that matches the new demand level while letting the cap limit excessive orders given the large in-transit stock.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). On-hand=20, in-transit=560. Historical Jan samples mean=22 but demand jumped starting Period 7 (Periods 7\u201311 mean=105.6, +380%) and has persisted through Period 14; lead time has been consistently 4 periods (observed P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). I set L to default (promised=4) because concluded arrivals confirm 4-period actual lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (regime from Period 7\u201314, 8 periods) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 8 demands to capture the new high-demand regime. Sigma_hat uses recent_N N=8 to capture recent volatility. These choices align pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods under the sustained higher demand while avoiding underforecasting due to outdated low-Jan samples.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand regime is elevated vs. historical Jan samples: last 9 demands (Periods 7\u201315) = [53,85,77,129,184,111,79,83,122], mean \u2248102.6 (\u2248+366% vs 22). On-hand=33, in-transit=425 (total pipeline=458) \u2014 ample coverage but demand remains high. Lead time evidence: concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period lead (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so set lead-time to observed average. Use recent_N (N=9) for demand mean and volatility to capture the new high-demand regime (1+L periods = 5 review+lead window). These choices bias the OR backend toward higher base stock to meet the sustained elevated demand while using recent volatility to avoid under/over-stating safety stock given clear regime shift.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent history shows sustained high demand since Period 7 (periods 7\u201316 demand average elevated) and concluded arrivals consistently indicate 4-period lead time. On-hand=52, in-transit=363 \u2014 pipeline is sizable. I set L to 'calculate' to confirm observed lead time from concluded arrivals (backend will compute average observed lead times \u22484). For demand I detect a changepoint at Period 7 with a sustained higher-demand regime; I provide recent_N=10 to base mu_hat on the last 10 samples (Periods 7\u201316) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of those recent samples, capturing the new elevated demand. I also provide sigma_hat recent_N=10 so variability is computed from the same recent regime. These choices prioritize service (higher base stock) to avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand regime while the large pipeline limits excessive new ordering risk.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been much higher since Period 7; last 5 demands (P13\u2013P17) = [79,83,122,172,185], supporting a high forecast. On-hand=0, in-transit=431 provides cover but arrivals lag due to 4-period lead time. Set L to promised lead time to reflect confirmed historical arrivals. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime so the OR engine orders to meet elevated demand while limiting holding cost exposure.

On-hand=0, in-transit=518 (covers several weeks but arrivals are delayed by lead time). I set L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 to capture the current high-demand regime (last 7 observed periods) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service under the new higher mean and observed volatility while respecting the capped ordering cap.

Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 7 (elevated weekly demand, multiple periods of 100+ units) and observed lead times consistently equal 4 in concluded arrivals. On-hand=0, in-transit=713. Use lead-time inference via observed arrivals (calculate) to reflect confirmed L\u22484. For demand, use recent_N over the current high-demand regime to capture the new mean and variability (N=13 periods: Periods 7\u201319) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the elevated demand and recent volatility, letting the OR backend set a higher base-stock while capping orders via its cap. This balances service level for high demand against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent demand has been much higher than historical Jan samples: sustained regime shift beginning Period 7 (Periods 7\u201320 show consistently elevated weekly demand). On-hand=0, in-transit=598 (large pipeline). Lead time: all concluded arrivals show 4-periods when arrivals occurred, so set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. Demand forecast: use recent_N for mu_hat using the most recent sustained high-demand regime (Periods 7\u201320), regime length = 14 \u2192 N=14 to capture the new higher mean while smoothing older low-Jan samples. Volatility: use recent_N with N=14 to reflect recent demand variability. These parameters prioritize service (higher mu_hat) to avoid stockouts given strong recent demand, while sigma_hat via recent samples lets OR backend size safety stock; using calculated L aligns pipeline coverage with observed arrivals and avoids underordering given past delays.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=33, in-transit=588. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 4 periods (multiple P1->P5..P17->P21 observations) with an isolated missing arrival at P19 only; demand regime shifted sharply upward starting Period 7 and has been sustained (recent high-demand regime). To supply (L+1) periods under the sustained high-demand regime, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times and use recent_N (N=15) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the base-stock on the 15-period high-demand regime (captures means/volatility since the regime change and avoids diluting with low pre-shift demand). This balances service level for the sustained high demand while keeping holding exposure tied to the measured volatility.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=96, in-transit=528. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time (many P->P+4 confirmations), so use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. Demand has shifted up sharply since Period 7; recent realized weekly demands (Periods 17-22 = 185,140,219,220,147,146) average ~176. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=6 to capture the new high-demand regime and recent volatility so the OR engine builds a larger base stock while avoiding overreaction to older low-demand samples. This balances service (high profit $4 vs holding $1) by sizing safety stock to recent demand variability and confirmed lead time.

Daily Profit: $436.00, Daily Holding Cost: $182.00
Daily Reward (R_t): $254.00

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22): demand has been in a sustained, higher regime since Period 7 (multi-period elevated weekly demand). Current on-hand=182 and in-transit=571 (pipeline=753) providing strong coverage against near-term demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To capture the sustained post-Period-7 demand regime and its volatility, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent 17 periods (regime length Periods 7\u201323 = 17) so the OR backend targets a higher base-stock and accounts for increased variability, balancing the high service-level objective (profit $4 vs hold $1) against holding cost.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/07/29 (Period 25). Recent history shows a sustained high-demand regime since Period 7 (large, multi-week increases) and confirmed actual lead time \u22484 in concluded messages. Current inventory: on-hand=52, in-transit=564 (pipeline total 616) which covers several weeks of current elevated demand. I set L via 'calculate' to let the backend use the observed lead-time average (concluded arrivals consistently indicate 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=18 to capture the post-change high-demand regime (regime spans Periods 7\u201324 => length 18, use N=18 per rule). Using recent_N for both mu_hat and sigma_hat ensures the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and variability from the current high-demand regime, balancing service-level needs against holding cost given ample pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=128, in-transit=539. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed repeatedly), so keep L as promised to match OR engine assumptions. Recent demand (Periods 19\u201325) shows a sustained high regime vs. Jan samples; I use a recent_N demand estimate to capture the current elevated mean and volatility. Selected N=7 (Periods 19\u201325) to reflect the most recent stable high-demand window so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current demand and avoid diluting with older low-demand January samples. This balances service (high fill rates) against holding cost given profit/holding q=0.8 (high service target).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/08/12 (Period 27). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods (many concluded orders P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting ~Period 7 (Periods 7\u201326 show much higher demand vs. historical Jan samples). On-hand=221, in-transit=586 (pipeline healthy). I set L=calculate to reflect observed lead times (average observed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 (use the last 20 periods since the regime shift at Period 7 to capture the new higher mean across the review+lead period). Similarly set sigma_hat recent_N N=20 to capture recent volatility. These choices align the base-stock target to the current high-demand regime while using observed lead time; with profit=4 and holding=1 this balances service level vs holding cost given strong pipeline.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent observed lead times consistently 4 periods; pipeline+on-hand = 396+348=744 units which covers several weeks of recent demand but demand has been variable. I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time=4. Demand has shifted recently; using recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the most recent summer demand regime (Periods 23\u201327 demands = 109,144,94,56,63) to keep orders responsive to current volatility while limiting excess holding given $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26. Recent demand has pulled back from the large spike earlier in the year but remains well above Jan baseline. On-hand=358, in-transit=341 (pipeline sufficient to cover lead+review). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods; no recent persistent loss. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (back-end uses 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current regime: last 5 demands = [144,94,56,63,45], mean=80.4 \u2192 mu_hat uses recent 5 periods to focus the base-stock on current realized demand. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility rather than long-ago low-variance Jan samples. These settings balance service level (capture elevated mid-year demand) while avoiding overstock from older low-demand history.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-09-02 (Period 30). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods across many orders \u2014 stick with promised/default behavior. Recent demand has fallen from the large spike (Periods 7\u201311) and the last 5 selling periods (P25\u2013P29 demands = 94,56,63,45,38; mean=59.2) better reflects near-term demand. To align the OR engine to current regime while preserving lead-time assumptions, use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=5 so (1+L) scaling uses current L and variability captures recent volatility. This keeps service aggressive enough to protect sales but reduces excess holding versus using the earlier high-demand regime.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). On-hand=627, in-transit=0 \u2014 large on-hand, no inbound expected (no overdue/ lost shipments currently). Historical lead times have repeatedly conformed to 4 periods (observed arrivals P1->P5 etc.), so keep L as promised to align OR engine with supplier promise. Recent demand has fallen from the earlier peak; last 5 realized demands (Periods 26\u201330) = [56,63,45,38,34], mean=47.2. To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and the recent lower demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean = 5*47.2 (it will compute exact value). Volatility should reflect recent variability, so set sigma_hat recent_N (N=5). These choices reduce target base stock relative to the earlier high-demand regime and limit new orders while current inventory depletes, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26 (2019/8/5): avg demand fell from previous high (Periods 7\u201311 mean=105.6) to recent Periods 26\u201330 mean=47.2 (\u2248-55%), sustained for 5 periods.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has settled lower after the high summer spike: Periods 27-32 demands = [63,45,38,34,32,?] (most recent 5 observed mean=42.4; regime since Period 26 showed mean\u224847.2). On-hand=595, in-transit=0 so current inventory is ample vs. short-term demand; no urgent arrivals expected. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default lead time. To match the recent lower post-spike regime and avoid excess holding cost, set demand forecast using recent data (recent_N) over the current regime (N=6) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This reduces excess ordering while preserving service given high on-hand inventory.

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods, so keep promised/default. Use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the new lower-demand regime while smoothing short noise; this focuses the OR backend on (1+L)-period demand estimated from the most recent 5 observations to balance service level vs holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). Recent demand (Periods 29-33) = [38,34,32,25,31], mean=32 units/week; on-hand=539, in-transit=0. Lead time has consistently concluded as 4 periods historically, so keep promised lead time. Demand has declined from the mid-summer regime (Period 26\u201330 mean=47.2) to the current lower regime; therefore set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods to target (1+L)\xd7current mean and recent volatility. This keeps orders aligned to the current lower demand and avoids excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: avg demand fell from 47.2 (Periods 26\u201330) to 32.0 (Periods 29\u201333), \u221232%, sustained for 5 periods

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=524, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible recently and no overdue shipment signals beyond historical resolved issues. Recent demand has been low (Periods 30\u201334 demands = 34,32,25,31,15; recent mean \u224827.4). To avoid excess holding cost while matching the current lower-demand regime, use recent_N (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from the most recent 5 periods. Use default lead time (promised L=4) because concluded history repeatedly confirms 4-period arrivals and no sustained evidence to change it now.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=513, in-transit=0. Recent demand has fallen from earlier peaks; latest 5 demands show a lower recent regime. No new confirmed lead-time change (historical concluded lead times = 4). To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and reduced demand, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the most recent short-run regime (recent_N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and volatility estimates accordingly.

Use observed lead-time average (confirmed as 4 historically) so backend uses realistic L. Demand has been low and stable for six periods so use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current low-regime mean/volatility and avoid inflating target stock; this balances profit ($4) vs holding ($1) by lowering replenishment compared with older high-demand regimes.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=481, in-transit=0. Recent demand (Periods 31\u201337) = [32,25,31,15,11,18,14], mean\u224820.9, showing a sustained decline vs prior regime (Period 29\u201333 mean=32). Lead time has been consistently 4 in concluded messages earlier; use promised/default L to align with supplier. To keep service while avoiding excess holding (Profit=$4, Holding=$1 \u2192 target service quantile q=0.8), use recent demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat: recent_N with N=7 (regime length=7) so (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std reflect current lower-demand regime. This reduces orders vs older high-demand periods and prevents waste given large on-hand position.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 31: recent mean (Periods 31\u201337)=20.9 vs prior regime mean=32.0 (\u2248-35%), sustained 7 periods.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has settled into the low regime observed since Period 31 (demands P31\u2013P38 = [32,25,31,15,11,18,14,12], mean \u224819.75). On-hand=469, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover for many periods at current demand; no arrivals expected (no recent orders in transit). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods historically; no new evidence of change. I set L to default (promised = 4). To reflect the current low-demand regime, I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures P31\u2013P38). This keeps the OR base-stock tuned to the current lower mean while letting the backend compute safety stock from recent volatility, balancing service vs holding cost given large on-hand inventory.

Lead time has been confirmed historically as 4 periods; no new evidence of change. To avoid overstock while preserving service, use promised lead time and a recent-window forecast reflecting the low-demand regime (use last 9 periods = regime length). This keeps base_stock aligned with current low demand and reduces excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 31 (Periods 31\u201340 average \u224821 then drifting lower to ~10s). On-hand = 452, in-transit = 0 \u2014 ample on-hand now versus low recent demand; no recent arrivals suggest shipments paused but historical lead time was confirmed at 4 earlier. I keep L at promised (default) and use recent demand statistics to capture the low-demand regime: set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 10 periods (N=10, regime length = 10) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to current low demand and reduces risk of excess holding costs while preserving service. This balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost given high current inventory and absent pipeline.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=449, in-transit=0; no shipments currently arriving. Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods, so using the promised/default lead time is appropriate. Recent demand has settled into a low regime (Periods 31\u201341: 11 weeks of recent demand observations); to capture the current lower mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=11 for demand mean and std. These choices keep L conservative (matches observed lead time) and base stock responsive to the recent low-demand regime, reducing holding cost while maintaining service.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=432, in-transit=0. Recent demand has settled into the low regime observed since Period 31 (Periods 31\u201337 mean=20.9; Periods 31\u201342 show consistently low weekly demand: 32,25,31,15,11,18,14,12,7,10,3,17). No arrivals expected (no in-transit). Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods; use promised lead time (default). To avoid overstock while maintaining service, set demand forecast using the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N on the last 12 observed weekly samples (Periods 31\u201342) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std over the recent regime.

On-hand=430, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample cover vs current low demand; no recent arrivals outstanding. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default L. To avoid excess holding cost while meeting service, forecast demand using the most recent 13-week regime (recent_N, N=13) for both mean and volatility so the OR engine sizes orders to current low demand rather than outdated high-demand regimes.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=425, in-transit=0. Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 31 (Periods 31\u201344 demand series: 32,25,31,15,11,18,14,12,7,10,3,17,2,5) \u2014 sustained lower-demand regime (~14 periods). Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). To avoid overstock while meeting near-term demand, keep promised lead time and base mu/sigma on the recent low-demand regime. Set L=default (promised 4). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=14 (covering Periods 31\u201344) so (1+L)*mean reflects the current low regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=14 to capture current lower volatility. This reduces ordering toward current low demand and limits holding cost given large on-hand stock.

Recent demand has fallen and remained low over the last 8 periods (Periods 39\u201346 demands = 7,10,3,17,2,5,6,6; mean \u22487.25), so use recent_N=8 to capture the current low-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This prevents over-ordering given high on-hand inventory and zero pipeline while the OR backend will compute base_stock and the capped order accordingly.
