Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 554792001 (women's belt). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean \u224835.2 units/week; on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet. Promised lead time retained (default) because no arrival history to infer a different L. Use full-sample defaults for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances target service level (driven by profit/holding cost ratio) against inventory holding given current zero inventory and no evidence of regime change.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed demand samples show weekly values around 7,33,28,63,45 and period-1 demand=29. On-hand=0, in-transit=70 (ordered in P1 but arrived=0 in P1 conclude). Promised lead time is 4 and there is no concluded arrival yet, so no evidence to change lead-time assumption or demand regime. Use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set; this balances service level given limited evidence while avoiding overreacting to one period's demand.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/2/25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples (Jan 2019): [7,33,28,63,45], mean \u224835.2. On-hand=0, in-transit=135 (orders from P1/P2) \u2014 shipments overdue relative to observation but only 2 missed conclude messages so far (insufficient to confirm lost shipment or change lead time). Use promised lead time to let OR backend assume L=4. Use default demand/volatility calculations so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this maintains service-level targeting while avoiding premature regime shifts given limited evidence. This balances profit vs holding cost conservatively while in-transit stock exists.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=201 with no arrivals concluded for Periods 1-3 so actual lead time unconfirmed; cannot infer reduced/changed lead time. Recent realized demand (conclude demands: 29, 47, 38) is materially higher than older historical sample mean, so I use a recent_N demand estimate (N=3) to capture the current higher regime. Keep L as promised (default) to let OR engine assume promised lead time; use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat to raise target base-stock and safety stock reflecting the demand uptick while avoiding overreaction to a single week.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent weekly demands (samples) avg=35.2 units; on-hand=0, in-transit=207. Four consecutive conclude messages show arrivals=0 for orders placed in Periods 1-4, so no confirmed shorter lead time; pipeline (207) exceeds (1+L)*mean demand (with promised L=4 gives 176) so no urgent replenishment needed. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes base stock from full-sample mean/std while respecting the observed large pipeline and avoiding extra orders that risk holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Orders placed in Periods 1-4 all concluded with arrived=0 (P1 ordered=70, P2 ordered=65, P3 ordered=66, P4 ordered=6) and remain unconfirmed; in-transit=207 -> significant delayed/lost-shipment signal (4 consecutive periods of no arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $100.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history shows the Period1 order arrived in Period5 => observed lead_time = 4. Current on-hand=36, in-transit=142 (pipeline substantial). Use L=calculate to reflect observed lead time (avg observed = 4). Demand history mean ~35.2/wk; with L=4 the default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean) captures demand over review+lead horizon. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical variability over the same horizon. These choices align the OR base-stock with confirmed lead time and historical demand while letting the backend cap orders to limit exposure to lost/delayed shipments.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period5)

Daily Reward (R_t): $124.00

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent demand has been elevated and stable (last 6 period demands: 29,47,38,38,34,45 \u2192 mean ~38.5). On-hand=56, in-transit=108; two concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and several earlier ordered units were delayed but now arriving, so continue using observed lead time. To balance service vs holding cost (profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 target fill high), I use recent data (last 6 periods) for demand forecast and volatility, and compute lead time from observed concludes (average). This keeps the base-stock responsive to the recent higher-demand regime while accounting for pipeline inventory and past delayed arrivals.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent concluded history shows three confirmed arrivals with lead_time=4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7) and demand samples mean ~35.2. On-hand=79, in-transit=84; prior multi-period delay/loss signal resolved by consecutive arrivals confirming actual lead time=4. Use L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (evidence supports 4). Use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this balances service level given profit/holding cost and leverages confirmed lead-time and full sample history.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). On-hand=48, in-transit=128; pipeline + on-hand provides coverage for upcoming periods but we must plan with confirmed L=4. I choose L by 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times. Demand history is limited and stable (samples 7,33,28,63,45); use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014this balances service level (using empirical mean/variance) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments is needed because lead time has been confirmed as 4 and recent arrivals matched orders.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): recent demand has been stable in the high-30s (last 9 periods mean \u224838.6). On-hand=17, in-transit=159 (total pipeline 176) and prior concludes confirm actual lead time = 4. To capture the recent regime and avoid overstating legacy older samples, I set L by calculating observed lead times (all observed =4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (last 9 demand observations) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std \u2014 this targets service while limiting extra holding given holding cost >0.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent weekly demand has been ~34-45 in periods 5-9 then dipped to 25 in period 10; on-hand=23 and in-transit=156 (large pipeline from prior orders). Past concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. I set L via calculate to confirm observed lead time. For demand I use recent_N (last 6 periods, P5-P10) to capture the most recent regime (includes the recent dip) so mu_hat reflects current demand trend across the review+lead window. I also set sigma_hat recent_N with same N to capture recent volatility. These choices keep target base stock sensitive to the recent lower demand while recognizing the sizable pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders placed earlier all arrived after 4 periods). On-hand=36, in-transit=132 -> pipeline + on-hand = 168 units, which covers ~4.8 weeks at historical weekly mean (~35.2). Demand samples (provided) have mean ~35.2/week; no recent sustained demand regime change observed. Given confirmed lead time of 4 and stable demand, use calculated L to reflect observed lead times and default demand/volatility that leverage all historical samples: this yields mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to target service level per profit/holding tradeoff, and sigma_hat default to capture overall variability across the full sample set. This balances avoiding stockouts (confirmed LT=4) while limiting excess inventory given holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=56, in-transit=118. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving 4 periods after ordering (e.g., P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8), so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. No new sustained demand regime or lead-time changes detected. I select L by "calculate" to use observed lead times, mu_hat "default" and sigma_hat "default" so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full history\u2014this keeps the base-stock aligned to the confirmed 4-period lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=92, in-transit=92 (pipeline healthy; recent arrivals confirm stable 4-period lead time). I set L=calculate to lock in observed lead time average (confirmed = 4). I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to bias forecasts toward the recent lower-demand regime (N=6 covers the most recent consistent 6-period demand pattern). This reduces overstock risk while keeping service given current pipeline.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=79, in-transit=74; profit=$4, holding=$1. Historical demand samples (Jan-Feb) average ~35.2/week. Recent history shows stable arrivals with confirmed actual lead time=4 (orders consistently arrived after 4 periods). No evidence of a demand regime shift in the last concluded periods (demands in concludes: 34,45,43,37,36,25,29,30,15,13,31). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (which matches observed lead time). Use mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level (using historical mean) against holding cost given moderate on-hand and pipeline inventory. No explicit adjustments despite past delayed shipments because lead time has been confirmed as 4 and recent arrivals are consistent.

Demand history (samples provided) shows no sustained regime shift; recent weeks' demand is moderate and stable. Use lead-time estimate computed from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period actuals (method: calculate). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost given stable demand and current healthy inventory/pipeline positions. No new missing-shipment signals detected in the last concluded periods.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has declined vs. the early-sample mean: last 5 demands (Periods 13-17) = [15,13,31,15,10], avg = 16.8 units/week. On-hand=117 and in-transit=60 (total pipeline 177) comfortably covers (1+L) periods at the recent demand rate. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 repeatedly; no new lost-shipment signals since Period 5 resolution. I set L=default (use promised 4). I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to anchor the forecast to the most recent regime (captures the sustained lower demand over the last 5 periods). I also use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices tighten target base-stock to avoid excess holdings while preserving service given confirmed LT=4 and current pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent history shows steady observed lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4) and demand has been moderate with no sustained regime shift beyond initial sample set. On-hand = 105, in-transit = 49 (pipeline adequate for near-term demand). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time average (4) rather than default promise, keeping arrival timing accurate. mu_hat and sigma_hat use 'default' so the OR backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all available demand samples, providing a conservative base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost (backend will set service quantile accordingly). This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while respecting confirmed lead time and current healthy inventory position.

Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and recent large demand spike (Period 19 demand=88) appears isolated (not yet 3+ periods). No sustained demand regime change detected. To be conservative and consistent with confirmed lead time, use default promised lead time and default demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level given current pipeline while avoiding overreacting to a single high-demand week.

Recent concluded arrivals consistently show a 4-period lead time; no sustained, multi-period demand regime shift (recent large spike at P19 appears isolated). I choose L by "calculate" to reflect observed lead-time data (matches confirmed 4).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=0, in-transit=153. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (confirmed in prior history). No sustained demand regime shift in recent periods (demand volatility and mean fluctuate but not persistently changed for 3+ periods). Pipeline (153) provides coverage toward (1+L)=5 periods. I therefore use the default promised lead time and default demand/statistics so the OR backend computes base_stock and cap using the full-sample mean/std; this balances service level (q=profit/(profit+holding)=0.8) against holding cost while relying on observed stable lead time and full-sample demand estimates.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-15 (Period 23). Recent demand has surged vs. early-sample baseline: Periods 19-22 demands = [88,50,127,113] (large, sustained increase). On-hand=0, in-transit=232 (pipeline sizable but some recent orders showed arrived=0 indicating occasional lost/delayed shipments). Lead time historically observed = 4 (consistent recent concludes). I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to let backend confirm average (matches confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (Periods 19-22) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent volatility (recent_N N=4). This raises target base-stock to meet higher demand while relying on pipeline=232 to cover some of the upcoming demand; using recent-based std improves safety stock to balance profit ($4) vs holding cost ($1).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand has increased sharply since Period 19 (recent 5-period mean ~83 vs prior mean ~29.9). On-hand=0, in-transit=356 (large pipeline) and prior history confirms actual lead time ~4. Given a clear, sustained demand regime change starting Period 19, I use a recent_N demand estimate (last 5 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and volatility. For L I select calculate to let the backend use observed lead-time history (which has repeatedly been 4). This balances service (higher target stock for the new regime) against holding cost by adapting forecast and volatility to recent data while relying on backend lead-time calculation.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 19: recent 5-period avg demand = 83.2 vs prior (Periods 1-18) avg = 29.9 (+178%), sustained for 5 periods

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand has shifted up since Period 19 (recent 5-period avg \u224884). On-hand=0, in-transit=426 (multiple arrivals concluded at 4-period lag historically). Lead time therefore treated as the observed average. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 periods so the backend sizes base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the higher mean while reflecting increased volatility.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime established at Period 19 (recent 5-period avg \u2248 88 units/week vs prior ~30). On-hand=0, in-transit=432 \u2014 ample pipeline but we must base forecast on sustained higher demand. Lead time has repeatedly observed as 4 periods. I set L based on observed lead times (calculate) to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new high-demand regime (uses last 5 weeks to compute (1+L)\xd7mean). Volatility also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect current variability. These choices steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock appropriate for sustained elevated demand while using recent variability to limit overstock given holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 19 (higher demand since then) and observed lead times consistently 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=428 (large pipeline). To respect confirmed LT evidence, set L via calculate (backend will infer avg observed LT=4). For demand forecast, use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 19-26, regime length=8) so mu_hat reflects elevated demand: choose recent_N with N=8. Use the same recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices focus the OR base-stock on the new high-demand regime while acknowledging the large in-transit pipeline (which the backend will net against), balancing service level against holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/08/19 (Period 28). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 19 (sustained; recent weeks demand ~85\u2013118). On-hand=33, in-transit=338 \u2014 pipeline comfortably large but recent high demand requires forecasting using recent data. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; I keep L at promised (default). Set mu_hat using recent 5 samples to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 5 demands). Set sigma_hat using recent 5 samples to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the base-stock up to meet elevated demand while sigma from recent data sets safety stock appropriate to recent variability, balancing service and holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1 (q=0.8).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 19 (recent 5-period avg \u224883.2). Observed lead times in concluded messages consistently equal 4. Current on-hand 88 + in-transit 323 = 411 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand for L=4. Choose L='calculate' to use the observed average lead time (4). Use mu_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to target the new higher-demand regime (captures recent avg \u224883.2 \xd7 (1+L)). Use sigma_hat='recent_N' with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to meet elevated demand while the sigma estimate controls safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/2 (Period 30). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 19 (recent 5-period avg demand \u224886). On-hand=101 + in-transit=350 = 451 units; promised lead time=4. I set L=default to use promised lead time (actual LT previously confirmed as 4, so default is appropriate). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) because the sustained regime shift (Periods 19+) makes the last 5 weeks the best predictor; mu_hat will therefore target (1+L)\xd7mean(last5)=5\xd7~86\u2248430. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias the OR engine toward covering 5 periods of elevated demand while keeping variance estimates current to avoid excessive safety stock given holding cost $1 and profit $4.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has been at the higher regime since Period 19 (recent 5-period avg \u224882 units/week). On-hand=129 + in-transit=305 => pipeline 434 units which covers (1+L) periods of expected demand under L\u22484. Observed concluded lead times have been consistently 4 periods; use calculated average lead time to reflect that. For demand, use recent_N (N=5) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (stabilized over the last 5\u201312 periods). Use recent_N for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices tighten the base-stock to the new demand level while the calculated L keeps reorder timing aligned with observed arrivals, balancing service (profit) vs holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand regime (from Period 19) is sustained high: last 5 demands = [118,78,56,47,46], recent-5 mean=69. On-hand=144, in-transit=279 (healthy pipeline). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4; use promised lead time. To capture the validated higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures most recent demand variability and centers base stock on current demand). This balances higher service needs (avoid stockouts under elevated demand) against holding cost by relying on recent data rather than long-run averages.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand regime (Period19+) shows higher mean than early history, but the most recent 4 weeks demand = [56,47,46,46] (avg \u224848.8). On-hand 216 + in-transit 161 = 377 units, which comfortably covers ~5\xd7recent weekly demand (~244 units) so we should not inflate forecast. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; use promised/default. Set demand forecast to recent_N (N=5) to capture the post-changepoint regime while emphasizing recent weeks; likewise use recent_N for volatility. These parameters steer the OR engine to a base-stock reflecting the recent realized demand (keeps service high but avoids excess holding given current large pipeline).

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=251 + in-transit=65 gives healthy cover vs (1+L) demand, so avoid aggressive extra ordering. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods -> use calculated lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (short window to react to regime while avoiding older low-demand data). This balances service (protects against stockouts under elevated demand) versus holding cost by not inflating estimates with long-history lows.

Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. To reflect the sustained higher demand I use a recent-demand estimate over the recent regime (N=16) so the OR engine raises the base stock; keep L as promised (default) since concluded data confirm 4. Sigma left as default to let backend use full-sample volatility. These settings prioritize service (capture higher demand) while relying on backend cap to limit overly large single orders.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 19; recent five concluded demands (P32-P36 = 46,61,72,88,126) average \u224878.6 which I use to capture the sustained elevated demand. Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 in conclues; use default promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 to respond to the confirmed regime while limiting exposure to older low-demand data. This increases target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of the current high demand while sigma from recent data controls safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost. No new carry-over insight.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand remains in the elevated regime (sustained high weekly sales since Period 19). On-hand=0, in-transit=380 (sizable pipeline). Actual lead time has been confirmed repeatedly as 4 in concluded history. To reflect the sustained higher demand while keeping pipeline-aware safety stock, I use the promised/default lead time and compute demand over the most recent 5 periods (captures current high regime). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N (N=5) so backend builds a base stock tailored to current demand volatility; L kept default to leverage confirmed 4-period flow and avoid over-adjusting for transient signals. This balances service (high profit relative to holding cost) against holding given large in-transit units.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=0, in-transit=526. Historical concluded lead times have been consistently 4 periods; recent demand is in the elevated regime (sustained higher demand since Period 19). However, several recent concludes (Periods 36-38) show arrived=0 suggesting some shipments may be missing/delayed. To capture true lead time use calculate (average observed lead times = 4). To reflect the elevated demand regime and recent variability I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (captures the last 5 demand samples to adapt forecast and risk buffer). These choices keep the OR engine targeting service for the higher-demand regime while using recent volatility to set safety stock, and using observed lead time to avoid underordering given overdue shipments and large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments resurfaced: Periods 36-38 concluded with arrived=0 for three consecutive periods (evidence of resumed lost/delayed shipments).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand remains elevated vs early history: last 5 demands (P35-P39) = [88,126,128,76,42], 5-period avg = 92. On-hand=85, in-transit=415 (large pipeline). Lead-time observations across concluded periods consistently show 4-period arrivals; use calculated/observed lead time. Set L by calculating observed lead times to keep backend aligned with confirmed behavior. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the current high-demand regime while limiting influence of older low-demand samples. This balances service (higher forecast for elevated demand) against holding cost given substantial pipeline inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-19.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent history: observed lead times consistently 4 periods (concluded arrivals show orders from Pn arriving at Pn+4), and delayed shipments from Periods 36-38 were followed by normal arrivals in Periods 39-40, so no persistent lead-time change. Demand regime shifted up around Period 19 and has remained elevated (recent 5-period avg demand \u224883.2 vs prior avg \u224829.9). Current inventory: on-hand=171, in-transit=320 \u2192 total pipeline=491. With promised L\u22484, review+lead horizon =5 periods; using recent 5-period demand avg (\u224883.2) gives (1+L)*mean \u2248416, so current pipeline comfortably covers expected demand while still exposing holding costs. Therefore: set L by averaging observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4), set mu_hat using recent_N with N=5 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime, and set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters prioritize service (q=0.8) while using recent demand to avoid under/overstock given resumed but previously intermittent shipment issues.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand remains elevated vs early-history (sustained regime shift detected earlier around Period 19). On-hand=272 + in-transit=193 gives substantial coverage vs expected demand; recent 5-period demand average used to capture current elevated regime while keeping responsiveness to short-term variation. Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods across many concluded arrivals, so use calculated lead time from observed lead times. Chosen methods: L by calculate to reflect observed lead times; mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to target the current elevated demand regime; sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility and avoid under/over-stocking given resumed but intermittent shipment issues.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). On-hand=379, in-transit=47. Historical concluded arrivals consistently imply actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) has moderated vs earlier spike; use a 5-period recent estimate to capture current regime. Set L to calculated average lead time to reflect observed confirmations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to target current demand level and volatility so the OR backend sizes base-stock to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Current on-hand=383, in-transit=31 (healthy buffer vs recent weekly demand). Recent concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (many observations) so use calculated average lead time. Recent demand has reverted to lower levels over the last 5 concluded periods (demands: P39-P43 = 42,38,28,39,12; recent avg \u224831.8) so I choose a recent_N forecast to tie mu_hat and sigma_hat to the most recent regime (N=5). This keeps target base-stock responsive to the current lower demand while relying on a confirmed lead-time estimate to avoid underordering if shipments resume delays.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/16 (Period 45). On-hand=402, in-transit=2. Recent concluded lead times remain consistent at 4 periods (no new sustained lead-time shift). Demand has fallen in the most recent five weeks (Periods 40-44 demands = 38,28,39,12,10) after earlier summer spike; use a recent-5 forecast to capture current low-week demand. Set L to promised (default). Set mu_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect current 5-week average demand ((1+L)\xd7mean recent demand). Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices reduce ordering while on-hand is high, lowering holding cost risk but keeping coverage for (L+1) periods of current demand.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=385, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible this period so pipeline is empty and current stock is sufficient for near-term demand. Historical concluded lead times have repeatedly been 4 periods (confirmed many times), so use promised/default lead time. Demand shows a sustained higher regime since Period 19 (large, sustained uplift); to capture the recent elevated demand level and variability I use recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the most recent 5 demand observations). This keeps the base-stock anchored to current demand while the empty pipeline avoids over-ordering; the OR backend will combine these estimates with profit/holding to set service level. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments now because recent concludes show arrivals consistent with L=4.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=371, in-transit=0. Recent concluded arrivals show lead time still consistent with promised 4 periods; no sustained new LT evidence. Demand has fallen from the mid-year spike \u2014 last 5 concluded demands (Periods 42-46) = [39,12,10,19,14], indicating a lower recent regime. To avoid over-ordering from the historical mid-year peak, keep L as default (promised 4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend sizes base-stock and safety stock to the most recent low-demand regime and reduces holding cost exposure given high on-hand inventory.
