  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period date 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas); recent weeks showed elevated demand but a single huge spike (P42=661) likely promotion/Black Friday. Demand analysis: exclude the 661 outlier; recent 4-week avg (P43\u2013P46) = (118+101+124+135)/4 = ~120/week. Lead time & pipeline: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals in concludes). In-transit=1016 equals outstanding orders 400 (ordered P43, arriving this period) + 616 (ordered P44, arriving P48). On-hand=0 but 400 will arrive during Period 47 and be available to satisfy Period 47 demand. Ordering logic: required cover = (L+1)=5 periods demand \u22485*120=600 units. Pipeline already provides 1016 units; placing additional order would increase holding cost ($1/unit/period = profit per unit) and risk overstock. Therefore place no new order this period.",
