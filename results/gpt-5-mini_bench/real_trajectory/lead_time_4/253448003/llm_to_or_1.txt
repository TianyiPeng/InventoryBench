Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. No on-hand or in-transit inventory; no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time. Historical weekly samples (5 weeks, early Jan\u2013Feb) are the only demand signal. Using promised lead time (default) and default demand estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (using full sample mean/variance) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=60 from Period 1 order which concluded as arrived=0 (no confirmed arrivals yet) \u2014 insufficient evidence to infer a lead-time change or lost shipment. Use promised lead time and historical demand: five weekly samples (mean=43.6/week) drive the forecast. Choose default L to keep promised lead time (no concluded lead-time observations). Choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service level (using full historical mean across the review+lead period) against holding cost given available pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=118 (orders 60+58). No arrivals have concluded yet (Period1 and Period2 orders show arrived=0) so actual lead time is not confirmed; shipments may still be in transit. Use promised lead time to avoid prematurely changing L. Demand history (five samples: 54,38,37,54,35) has mean 43.6; no sustained regime change detected. Set L to default (promised 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level versus holding cost given current uncertainty and outstanding pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent historical weekly demand (samples provided) averages ~43.6 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=178 (multiple outstanding orders placed in P1\u2013P3). No concluded arrivals have been observed yet; however promised lead time is 4 and those orders are not yet due to conclude, so no confirmed lead-time shift. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand stats to let the OR engine compute base stock from full-sample mean/variance. This keeps the policy responsive to the established historical mean while avoiding premature adjustments for potentially delayed but not-yet-confirmed shipments. Holding cost is low relative to profit, so default statistics maintain adequate service without overreacting to unconfirmed delays.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Historical weekly demand samples (54,38,37,54,35) \u2192 mean=43.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=240 (sum of orders P1-P4). No concluded arrivals that indicate an actual lead-time different from the promised 4; orders are merely in-transit. Using promised lead time keeps consistency with available evidence. Default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean) yields (1+4)\xd743.6=218 forecast over review+lead window; pipeline (240) already exceeds this forecast so no aggressive uplift needed. Volatility set to default to reflect sample variability. These choices avoid over-ordering given holding cost while maintaining service given current in-transit stock and no confirmed lead-time changes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $540.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=30, in-transit=198. History shows one concluded arrival: Period 5 conclude -> 60 units arrived (ordered P1), confirming an actual lead time of 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 1-5) = [37,55,55,37,30]; mean = 42.8, showing moderate volatility but a slight downward pull in P5. I set L using calculated/observed lead times to align promised vs. actual. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (including the last five observed demands) so the backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std. This balances service (use recent demand) against holding cost given tight visibility of lead time and in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent weekly demand samples (provided) have mean ~43.6; no sustained regime shift detected. On-hand=45, in-transit=169 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=214 units, which roughly matches (1+L)*mean \u2248 218, so no aggressive correction needed. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior history and matches promised lead time; use default lead time so backend uses promised L. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This balances service (keeps supply near target coverage of 5 weeks) against holding cost given low holding cost ($1) relative to profit ($19).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent weekly demand samples (N=5) have mean 43.6 units/week; confirmed lead time = 4 periods (carry-over). Current on-hand=60, in-transit=146 => pipeline=206, well above expected 5-week demand (~218 using sample mean). I choose default lead time (promised 4) consistent with observed confirmations, and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical mean and std to compute base stock. This balances service (high profit per unit) against holding costs given already-large pipeline and avoids overreacting to small demand noise.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1-P4 arrived in P5-P8). On-hand=39, in-transit=128 \u2192 ample pipeline but recent demand spike (Period 8 demand=83) raises short-term risk. Use observed lead-time average to lock L=4 so backend scales review+lead period correctly; use default demand aggregation for mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples) to smooth the recent spike while remaining responsive via the OR cap. This balances service level (protects against the Period 8 surge) against holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time \u22484 periods. Current on-hand=16, in-transit=180 -> pipeline+on-hand=196. Historical weekly mean from samples = 43.6; (1+L)=5 implies expected 5-period demand \u2248218, so pipeline slightly short (~22 units). To reflect confirmed lead time and use full historical sample for stable demand estimate, set L by averaging observed lead times and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (acknowledging a small shortfall) against holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, in-transit=220. Historical concluded lead times all 4 periods (orders placed P1-P6 arrived after 4), so use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time. Demand history (samples from Jan-Feb) shows no strong recent regime shift; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps policy aligned with observed LT=4, leverages entire sample set for stable demand estimate, and avoids overreacting to short-term demand volatility while covering (L+1) periods of demand given current pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=0, in-transit=246. Recent concluded demands show a regime shift upward around Period 8 (demands P8-P12 = 83,41,58,64,73) vs earlier lower values; I treat the most recent 5 periods as the current demand regime. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior insight, so keep promised/default lead time. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to capture the higher recent mean over the review+lead horizon, and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR base-stock toward meeting the elevated recent demand while reflecting increased variance, balancing lost-sales profit vs holding cost given the large in-transit position.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). On-hand=0, in-transit=266 units which exceeds the (1+L)-period demand implied by historical mean (mean demand \u224843.6, (1+4)\xd7mean \u2248218), so pipeline appears sufficient. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and population-wide demand statistics (no recent changepoint detected) so the OR backend can compute the base-stock and cap reliably while avoiding extra holding cost exposure.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (carry-over). On-hand=0, in-transit=244 which covers multiple future periods given L=4. Historical sample mean (5 weekly samples from Jan) = 43.6. I choose L=default (use promised lead time 4). For demand forecast I use mu_hat=default so backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples (captures baseline weekly demand \xd7 review+lead). For sigma_hat I use default so backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). No new sustained changepoint (recent spike in Period 14 is single large observation), so be conservative to avoid overreacting and excess holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=0, in-transit=287. Recent demand has stepped up starting Period 13 with two very large weeks (163,141 in P14\u2013P15); I treat this as a new higher-demand regime. Promised lead time was 4 and prior conclude messages confirm lead time=4. To capture the recent demand increase I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 weeks (Periods 13\u201315) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility; I keep L=default (promised=4) since concluded history supports it. This balances higher service level for the new regime while relying on observed lead time consistency and the large in-transit stock to avoid immediate stockouts.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=0, in-transit=444. Past concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals P5\u2013P16). Pipeline (444) is sizeable and likely covers upcoming demand for the next (1+L) periods. I therefore use the default promised lead time and default demand estimates based on the full sample history: L default (promised=4) so backend uses (1+L)*mean of all samples for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)*std for sigma_hat. This keeps forecasting anchored to the historical weekly mean (43.6) scaled by review+lead window (5) \u2192 mu_hat baseline=218, while sigma default captures observed variability scaled by \u221a(1+L). Given large in-transit inventory, defaults avoid overreacting to recent high-demand spikes while the pipeline is consumed; if arrivals fail or further conclude messages show lost shipments, I will switch to explicit/recent_N lead-time adjustments.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand has stepped up vs the historical 2019-Jan samples: periods 11-17 demands = [64,73,79,163,141,139,105] (mean=109.14), indicating a sustained higher regime starting around Period 11. On-hand=0, in-transit=374 (covers multiple future periods). Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods (carry-over). I set L to default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=7) to capture the new high-demand regime (regime length 7 periods from P11\u2013P17). Using recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) captures volatility in this regime. These choices push the backend to raise base stock to meet higher demand while sigma from the same recent window controls safety stock to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=501 units (ample pipeline). Promised lead time is 4 and past concluded arrivals confirm L=4. I set L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the new high-demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)*mean of the last 5 demands). For volatility I use recent_N N=5 so the OR engine inflates safety stock to reflect observed variability. These choices align ordering with the confirmed higher demand while the large in-transit position prevents over-ordering.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/1. Recent demand has shifted materially higher since Period 14 (weekly demands: P14\u2013P20 = 163,141,139,105,80,120,89). Current inventory: on-hand=111, in-transit=374 \u2192 pipeline=485. Anticipated demand over review+lead (1+L periods) should reflect the new high-demand regime; pipeline (485) is short of ~5\xd7recent weekly demand (~5\xd7119.57=598.8), so orders are needed. I set L by calculating observed lead times (all concluded arrivals show 4), and I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=7 (periods 14\u201320) to capture the sustained higher demand regime and recent volatility. This guides the OR backend to raise the base stock to meet the new demand level while sigma_hat recent_N captures recent variability for safety stock.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 14: avg weekly demand increased from 43.6 (historical sample mean) to 119.57 (Periods 14\u201320 mean), +174% (P14\u2013P20 = 163,141,139,105,80,120,89).

Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To protect service during the higher-demand regime, I use the promised/default L and set demand forecast using the recent regime (last 7 weeks, Periods 14\u201320) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean over the review+lead period. I use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to capture volatility of that same regime. This increases target base-stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat informs safety stock to balance profit vs holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 14 (weekly demands P14\u2013P22: 163,141,139,105,80,120,89,70,85) with on-hand=150 and in-transit=401 (no obvious lost shipments; arrivals have matched a 4-period lead time historically). I set L via "calculate" to let the backend confirm observed lead time from concluded arrivals (evidence: multiple P* conclude messages showing 4-period lag). For demand I use recent_N with N=9 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 14\u201322) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(latest 9 samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(latest 9 samples) via recent_N N=9; this raises target base-stock to meet the new demand level while sigma_hat recent_N captures the current volatility. These settings prioritize meeting elevated demand (protect profit) while keeping holding cost in check by using the capped-order logic.

I set mu_hat to recent_N with N=7 to base the (1+L)\xd7mean forecast on the identified high-demand regime (Periods 14\u201320) so the base-stock targets the new demand level while avoiding excessive stock from older low-demand data. I set sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7 to capture current volatility in that regime, which lets the OR backend size safety stock appropriately and balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=146, in-transit=340. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (higher weekly demand through Periods 14\u201324). To capture the post-shift demand level and recent volatility I use recent_N over the most recent 11 weeks (Periods 14\u201324). This raises mu_hat to meet service under the higher-demand regime while sigma_hat recent_N reflects recent variability; L kept at promised to match observed lead time and avoid over-adjusting for lost shipments.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (weekly mean rose from ~43.6 to ~119.6 for P14\u2013P20) and high weekly demand has persisted through P25. On-hand=240 + in-transit=327 provides healthy coverage but some in-transit arrivals may be delayed historically; promised lead time was confirmed as 4 in earlier periods. I therefore keep L as default (promised 4). For demand I use a recent_N window covering the post-change regime to capture the new higher mean and variability: regime length from P14\u2013P25 is 12 periods, so set N=12 for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This biases the base-stock to meet the higher demand while sigma from the same recent window ensures safety stock reflects current volatility and balances profit vs holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2189.00

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Demand regime shift at Period 14 (mean rose from ~43.6 to ~119.6) persists; recent weekly demands (Periods 21\u201326) = [70,85,83,101,76,124], showing sustained higher mean and elevated variance. On-hand=167 + in-transit=341 -> pipeline=508, so coverage adequate short-term. Lead times observed consistently 4 periods in concluded history. I set L by calculate to confirm observed lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the new higher regime using the last 6 weeks, so mu_hat reflects (1+L)*recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent std scaled by sqrt(1+L). This increases service level for the sustained higher demand while avoiding over-reliance on older low-demand samples, balancing profit vs holding cost given low holding cost ($1) and relatively high profit ($19).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 14 (weekly demands P14\u2013P27 mostly 80\u2013163, recent weeks 76\u2013124). On-hand=176, in-transit=236 => pipeline total 412 units which covers multiple weeks at current demand (~100+). Lead time observations in concluded messages are consistently 4 periods. I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time=4. For demand forecast I use a recent_N approach focusing on the post-changepoint regime (Period 14 onward) to capture the higher mean; regime length = 14 periods (P14\u2013P27) so N=14. I apply the same recent_N window for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices make mu_hat reflect the new higher demand and sigma_hat reflect recent variability; using calculate for L ensures orders account for the confirmed 4-period transit and avoids underordering given overdue/lost-order risk.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history confirms actual lead time = 4 (recorded earlier). Demand has been in a higher regime since Period 14; recent weeks (Periods 22\u201328 demands = 85,83,101,76,124,110,103) average ~97.4/week. On-hand 73 + in-transit 389 = 462 units vs (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 recent mean \u2248 487 \u2192 modest shortfall in pipeline. To keep service during the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N=7 for demand mean/volatility to bias orders toward recent demand while keeping L at promised (confirmed). This balances profit (high per-unit) against holding cost by sizing stock to recent realized demand and variability.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 14 (Periods 14\u201329 demand mostly 80\u2013163, avg ~119). On-hand=132, in-transit=320 \u2014 pipeline is healthy but demand remains elevated so base stock should use the higher recent mean. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes and matches promised L=4. I set L=default to use promised lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (Periods 14\u201329 constitute the sustained high-demand regime) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7mean of the recent regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N with N=16 to capture volatility in the same recent window. These choices bias orders toward meeting the higher observed demand while letting the OR backend compute the z* tradeoff using profit/holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (observed P1\u2192P5 etc.). Recent demand regime shift (P14\u2013P20) raised weekly mean substantially (~119.6). Current inventory: on-hand=136, in-transit=404 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple weeks. To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost, keep L as promised (stable, confirmed by history) and set demand forecast using the recent high-demand regime (use recent_N over that regime) so the OR backend sizes base-stock to cover elevated demand. Use same recent_N window for sigma to reflect increased volatility observed during the higher-demand regime. No explicit adjustments for lost shipments required at this time (arrivals have been largely concluding on LT=4).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=103, in-transit=409 covers several weeks of elevated demand but some past arrival gaps (e.g. P28 arrived=0) warrant caution. Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4 (many P arrivals = ordered on P-4). Demand shifted higher starting Period 14 and has persisted; use recent demand to capture the new regime. Choices: L=default to use promised lead time (4) consistent with observed conclues; mu_hat=recent_N with N=18 to base (1+L)*mean on the last 18 weekly demands (captures sustained higher mean since P14); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=18 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters bias the OR backend toward higher target base stock to avoid stockouts in the new higher-demand regime while sigma_hat captures increased variability to size safety stock.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=216, in-transit=353 (ample pipeline). Past concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period 6 insight). Recent demand has trended down from the high regime (P14\u2013P20) into lower but variable weekly demand (P26\u2013P32 = 124,110,103,98,61,47,40). Use promised/confirmed lead time to align with concluded arrivals (L default). Forecast demand with an EWMA to give more weight to the recent downward trend while retaining some memory of the prior higher regime (EWMA gamma=0.3). Use recent_N=7 for sigma_hat to capture current observed volatility over the last 7 weeks (P26\u2013P32). These settings balance service (covering lead time with mu_hat) against holding cost given a healthy pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=220, in-transit=265. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4 (carry-over). Demand experienced a sustained regime shift in Periods 14\u201320 (mean ~119.6) but recent weekly demand has cooled; last 7 concluded demands (P27\u2013P33 = 110,103,98,61,47,40,84) show a lower recent mean (~70). To balance service vs holding cost given large on-hand+pipeline and the earlier confirmed LT=4, use promised LT (default) and compute demand forecast from recent data (recent_N, N=7) so mu_hat reflects the latest demand level while sigma_hat uses recent volatility (recent_N, N=7). This avoids over-ordering against an old high-demand spike while keeping safety for short-term variability. No evidence of new lost shipments beyond earlier confirmations.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 14 (mean ~119.6) vs historical mean ~43.6; on-hand=322 and in-transit=123 are ample today. Promised lead time is 4 and previous concludes confirm 4-period arrivals. I therefore keep L at the promised value to match observed confirmations, and set demand forecast and volatility using the most recent regime data: use recent_N with N=20 to capture the last 20 weeks (caps the regime length at 20) so mu_hat reflects the post-changepoint higher mean while sigma_hat captures recent variability. This balances service level (avoid stockouts in high-demand regime) against holding cost given current high inventory.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 14 (mean ~119.6 wks P14\u2013P20) and subsequent elevated weekly demand through current periods; on-hand=314 and in-transit=217 (total pipeline=531) which currently provides healthy cover vs elevated demand. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. To capture the post-changepoint demand level while remaining responsive to recent variability, I use the promised lead time (default) and compute demand stats from the most recent regime using recent_N with N=20 (captures the last ~20 observations since the shift) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This increases target base-stock to protect service during higher demand while the capped order will limit excessive single-period receipts to control holding cost.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=382, in-transit=121. Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P->P+4 observations) and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 14 (Periods 14\u201320 mean \u2248119.6 vs prior mean \u224843.6). To protect service while avoiding excess holding cost given high profit/low holding ($19 vs $1) I keep promised lead time (default) and forecast demand using the recent high-demand regime. I use recent_N with N=20 (capped at 20) to capture the sustained elevated demand since Period 14. I apply recent_N for sigma_hat with the same N to reflect volatility in the new regime. This biases base-stock upward to meet elevated demand while sigma is based on recent variability so the OR backend can compute an appropriate safety stock.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Recent demand has moderated (last several weeks ~27\u201347 units/week) after the earlier high-demand regime (P14\u2013P20). Current inventory (on-hand 349 + in-transit 121 = 470) comfortably covers ~5 periods of recent demand, reducing urgency to increase target stock. No new confirmed lead-time deviations in concluded history (lead time previously confirmed as 4). I therefore use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full-sample mean/variance; this balances service (profit=19 vs holding=1) without overstocking given healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Current on-hand=330, in-transit=125 (total pipeline=455). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Demand experienced a past regime shift (Periods 14\u201320) but recent weeks (Periods 33\u201338) show lower weekly demand (47,27,29,33,26). Given large on-hand + in-transit position, I will use the promised/default lead time and global-sample demand estimates to avoid over-ordering and high holding costs. Using defaults lets the OR backend compute base stock from full-sample mean/variance while respecting the promised L=4.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent weekly demand has returned to low levels (Periods 35\u201339 demands = 27,29,33,26,25). On-hand 418 + in-transit 33 provides ample coverage versus short recent demand; no new lost shipments observed and historical lead time confirmed as 4. I choose L=default (promised 4) and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to prioritize the most recent low-demand regime (captures recent mean/vol volatility) so the OR backend reduces ordering and holding costs while preserving service.

On-hand=361 + in-transit=80 = pipeline 441, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of current low demand. Lead time has been previously confirmed as 4 periods. To avoid excess holding cost while maintaining service, I use a short recent window to capture the current low-demand regime for mu and sigma.

Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. I therefore keep L as promised (default). For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the current low-demand regime (use last 9 concluded weeks, Periods 34\u201342) rather than the earlier summer spike. I also use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This reduces excess holding while preserving service given current demand.

Historical data includes a confirmed demand regime shift in Period 14\u201320 (not new here) and lead time previously confirmed as 4. No recent sustained changepoint in demand or lead time; pipeline appears healthy (no long overdue shipments).

Recent weekly demand (Periods 40\u201344 = 31,27,42,17,19) has returned to a lower regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). Current on-hand=316, in-transit=114. Historical data shows a past confirmed lead time=4 and an earlier sustained demand regime spike in mid-year, but recent weeks (Periods 40\u201346) show much lower demand (~31,27,42,17,19,27,20; mean \u224826). I keep L as default (promised 4, consistent with observed confirmations). To reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduce holding cost, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using a recent_N window of the last 7 observations (Periods 40\u201346) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent mean and volatility anchored to current low-demand signal while still covering L+1 periods of demand.
