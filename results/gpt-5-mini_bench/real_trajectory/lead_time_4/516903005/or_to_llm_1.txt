Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: Confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (from prior concluded messages). Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 144, in-transit = 20 \u2192 total available = 164. Recent demand pattern: Periods 45\u201346 demand = 156, 145 (very high) and earlier carry-over insights show a sustained high-demand regime since Period 29 (avg ~137+). Risk assessment vs OR: OR recommends 217 using historical averages and promised L; that is insufficient given current high regime and L+1 = 5 periods of exposure (orders placed now will only arrive in 4 periods). Requirement: ensure on-hand + in-transit + order cover expected demand over next 5 periods. Using a conservative forecast of ~145 units/week (consistent with most recent large weeks), 5-period demand \u2248 725 units. Subtract current available 164 \u2192 needed \u2248 561 units. Adjustment: round to a practical whole number and provide slight buffer for variability. Final action: order 560 units. This balances avoiding stockouts in a confirmed high-demand regime (high profit $19 vs holding $1 favors stocking) while limiting excessive extra inventory.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "OR's 217 is too low for the sustained high-demand regime (recent weeks ~145 units); with lead time=4 and 5-period exposure I order 560 to cover ~5\xd7145 demand minus current 164 on-hand/pipeline.",
