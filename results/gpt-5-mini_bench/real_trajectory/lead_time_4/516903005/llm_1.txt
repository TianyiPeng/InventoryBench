Inventory calculation: 5 * 18 = 90 units required to cover the next 5 periods at average demand. Cost tradeoff: profit per unit ($19) is large relative to holding ($1/period), so aiming to meet forecasted demand rather than understock.

Recent weeks include two large spikes (Periods 45-46) consistent with holiday demand but not yet a sustained regime change. b) Demand regime analysis: Historical sustained regime shifts require 3+ periods; recent high demand (156,145) is 2 periods only\u2014insufficient to declare a new sustained regime. Long-run recent baseline (Periods 39-44) averaged ~73/week with some variability. c) Lead time / orders: Actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods from prior concluded messages; no in-transit inventory. d) Inventory & pipeline: On-hand = 210 units, holding cost = $1/unit/period. With no confirmed sustained demand increase and a high on-hand position covering multiple weeks of expected demand (210 >> expected weekly demand ~70\u2013150), additional ordering risks high holding cost and potential excess. e) Final order logic: Do not place new orders this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost and because on-hand inventory adequately covers foreseeable demand given 4-period lead time and no confirmed sustained uptick.",
