Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0. Historical weekly demand shows a sustained downward shift over the last 3 samples (2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04: 196, 176, 172) vs earlier weeks (overall mean 225). I treat lead time as promised (default) since no arrival history exists. To capture the recent lower-demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (the 3-period recent regime). This reduces target base stock to avoid excess holding given profit=holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04: last 3-week avg=181.33 vs overall avg=225 (-19.5%); sustained 3 periods of decline.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent data show a sustained decline: last 3-week avg demand=181.33 vs overall avg=225 (\u221219.5%). On-hand=0, in-transit=203 (order from P1 still en route). No concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer actual lead time\u2014use promised lead time. To reflect the confirmed recent lower-demand regime, set demand estimate using recent_N (N=3) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of the last 3 samples. Use recent_N for sigma to reflect reduced recent volatility. These parameters reduce overstock risk while preserving service given the on-hand + pipeline.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand has shown a sustained downshift (carry-over insight noted). On-hand=0, in-transit=415 (orders from P1+P2); no arrivals have concluded so actual lead time is unconfirmed. I choose L=default (use promised 4) because there is insufficient concluded arrival data to infer a different lead time. For demand I select mu_hat=default to use the full-sample mean scaled by (1+L) which is conservative given limited new data and the recent modest decline; sigma_hat=default to retain full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These defaults provide the OR engine with stable base-stock sizing while we wait for concluded arrivals to confirm lead-time or demand regime changes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 4 (2019-03-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=762 (orders placed earlier not yet concluded; promised L=4 so arrivals would appear later \u2014 cannot infer actual lead time yet). Historical demand shows a sustained decline starting 2019-01-21 (recent 3-week avg lower). To avoid overstock given profit=holding ($1/$1 \u2192 q=0.5) and sizable in-transit pipeline, set lead time to default (use promised L=4) and use recent_N (N=3) for demand mean and volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the recent lower demand regime and reduce target base-stock relative to using the full-sample mean.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent sales show a sustained downward regime (Period 1 carry-over noted: 2019-01-21 to 2019-02-04 avg fell ~19.5%). On-hand=0, in-transit=1103. Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals yet (expected arrivals become visible next period), so no confirmed lead-time change. To reflect the recent lower demand, set demand forecast using the most recent 3-sample regime (captures the 3-period decline). This keeps L as promised (avoid overreacting to in-transit stock) while reducing target base-stock to match the lower recent mean, lowering holding cost risk given profit=holding cost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $41.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent demand has been lower than the long-run mean (recent 3-week avg=181.33 vs overall=225). On-hand=81, in-transit=957 (large pipeline). Period 5 conclude confirmed an arrival from Period 1 (203 units), showing actual lead time evidence. To reflect the sustained recent lower demand regime while accounting for the confirmed lead time and large pipeline, I set L by averaging observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) forecast and volatility on the last 3 weeks where demand dropped. This reduces order targets vs using the full-sample mean and helps lower holding costs given high in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5: ordered=203, arrived=203; observed lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). On-hand=146, in-transit=745. Two concluded arrivals show observed lead_time=4 consistently. Recent demand has declined vs earlier baseline (carry-over noted: last 3-week avg=181.33 vs overall 225). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (avg observed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the sustained lower regime (most recent 3 periods reflect the new lower mean) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 3 demands). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the confirmed 4-period lead time and the recent lower demand, reducing overstock risk while preserving service given large in-transit pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent demand has declined and stabilized over the last 3 periods (Period5-7: 122,147,158 => avg=142.33), and lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed arrivals P5-P7). On-hand=335 + in-transit=398 = 733 units, which covers roughly 5 periods at the recent lower demand (~142\xd75\u2248711) but is below coverage using the longer-term average. To reflect the confirmed lead time and the recent lower demand regime, set L by calculate (uses observed lead times=4). Forecast demand using recent_N N=3 to capture the sustained lower regime. Use recent_N N=3 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These parameters reduce overstocking from older higher-demand data while preserving service given confirmed LT=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-314.00

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. Recent realized demand (Periods 5-8 = 122,147,158,181) is well below the older sample mean, indicating a sustained lower-demand regime but with a modest upward trend in the last 4 periods. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). On-hand (495) + in-transit (57) = 552 covers several weeks of current lower demand (~152/wk). I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed L=4. For demand forecast and volatility I use the most recent 4 periods (N=4) to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent trending, so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the contemporary mean and variability over the review+lead horizon and keep ordering conservative versus older high-demand samples.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=472, in-transit=193. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6 etc.). Recent demand has been lower than earlier historical baseline; last 5 concluded demands (P5\u2013P9) = [122,147,158,181,80], indicating a sustained lower regime. To protect service with confirmed L=4 and reflect the recent lower-demand regime, I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (covers last 5 periods). This yields mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime and lets the OR engine size orders to balance $1 profit vs $1 holding cost under the confirmed lead time.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has declined sharply: last 3 periods demands = [80,75,54], mean=69.67 (\u2248 -62% vs overall sample mean 225) \u2014 a sustained 3-period low-demand regime. On-hand=343 + in-transit=216 = 559 units, which covers ~5 periods at the recent pace (L+1=5). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages. To avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding cost, I use a recent-demand estimate (3 periods) so the OR base-stock reflects the new low regime while using calculated lead time to match observed arrivals. Sigma is also estimated from the same recent window to reflect reduced volatility.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=275, in-transit=216. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (multiple confirms). Recent demand (Periods 5\u201312) shows a lower regime vs earlier samples (demands: 122,147,158,181,80,75,54,68; recent average ~111). To protect service with promised L=4 but let backend compute exact lead time from observations, I select L=calculate. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstock, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (the eight most recent demand observations) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility over the recent regime. This balances service level (capture current demand) against holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=426, in-transit=86 \u2192 ample coverage now; avoid inflating future orders. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=338, in-transit=63. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders ordered on P1-P4 arrived with lead_time=4). Recent demand has settled well below the long-run sample mean (several recent weeks: 80,75,54,68,42,111,122 earlier), indicating a persistent lower-demand regime. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (4). I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and variability estimate on the most recent 7 demand observations, which captures the sustained lower-demand regime and reduces overweighting older higher-demand samples; this helps the OR engine compute a smaller base stock and avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given confirmed lead time and current pipeline.

No new sustained demand regime change (recent spike P15=272 is single-period). To keep the OR backend responsive to recent demand while respecting confirmed LT=4, I use default lead time (promised=4) and recent_N=5 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat to emphasize latest demand pattern (balances service vs. holding given profit=holding). This ensures base_stock is driven by recent demand while pipeline coverage (1+L periods) is considered by backend.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has risen: Period15-17 demands = 272,246,244 (avg=254) vs historical sample mean=225 (+12.9%). On-hand=0, in-transit=610 \u2014 pipeline is sizable but arrivals are delayed by promised lead time. Observed lead time historically = 4 periods; use default promised L to keep alignment with backend. To respond to the sustained 3-period demand uptick, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=3) so the (1+L)-horizon forecast reflects the new higher regime. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to improve service during the confirmed higher-demand regime while sigma from recent data informs safety stock; using recent_N keeps responsiveness without overreacting to single spikes.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15 (2019-05-20) to Period 17 (2019-06-03): last 3-week avg=254 vs overall avg=225 (+12.9%); sustained 3 periods of higher demand.

Recent demand jumped starting Period 15 (Periods 15-17 avg=~254 > overall ~225); latest concluded demands remain elevated (Periods 15-18: 272,246,244,202). To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on the most recent sustained 3-period uplift). Use calculate for L to let backend average observed lead times (evidence strongly supports 4). This raises the base_stock to meet the higher recent demand while sigma from recent_N captures elevated variability; balancing profit vs holding cost given profit=holding=1.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=0, in-transit=1118 (large pipeline) so upcoming arrivals should cover demand but visibility lags due to 1-period conclude delay. Lead-time has repeatedly observed 4 periods; use calculated lead time to reflect observed data. For demand forecast use recent_N (N=3) to capture the sustained higher regime starting Period 15; same recent_N (N=3) for sigma to reflect current volatility. These choices bias base_stock upward to protect service during the higher-demand regime while relying on large in-transit to limit new orders and avoid excess holding costs.

Demand shows a sustained higher regime starting around Period 15 (2019-05-20) with several high-demand weeks; to focus the forecast on the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N with N=6 (captures Periods 15-20 demand pattern). Using recent demand reduces stockout risk given large pipeline but preserves holding-cost control by limiting horizon to recent regime.

Date 2019-07-08 (Period 22). On-hand=291, in-transit=558. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4), so set L based on recent observed lead times. Recent demand over the last 3 conclude periods (Periods 19-21: demands 130,120,163) is much lower than the earlier May spike; to be responsive to this apparent downward shift I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 3 observations so the OR engine targets lower base stock and tighter variability assumptions, reducing holding cost while still covering near-term demand. No new carry-over patterns to record.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=350 + in-transit=278 => pipeline=628 units (covers multiple review+lead periods). Lead time has repeatedly concluded as 4 periods. To reflect the most recent demand level while keeping the backend safety buffer, I set L to be calculated from observed lead times, use a recent_N forecast for mu_hat to capture current regime (last 5 weeks), and match sigma_hat to recent volatility (last 5 weeks). This balances service (use recent demand) against holding cost given already-large inventory and confirmed L=4.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Recent demand (Periods 21-23 = 163, 221, 171) averages 185/wk. Promised lead time is 4 and recent conclude history consistently shows 4, so use default lead time. Given the recent post-regime variability and a clear shortfall between current pipeline (on-hand 443 + in-transit 222 = 665) and coverage needed over review+lead, I set mu_hat using recent_N on the last 3 demand observations to capture the current regime (1+L=5 -> 5*185=925 demand over review+lead). I set sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to reflect short-run volatility. These choices make the OR backend raise the base stock to restore coverage for the current observed demand while keeping variance estimate tied to recent variability.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent on-hand=360 + in-transit=459 = 819 units. Historical long-run mean from provided samples = 225/wk, but recent realized weekly demand (Periods 20-24 = 120,163,221,171,83) averages 151.6, indicating a recent lower-demand regime. Observed conclude messages show consistent 4-period actual lead times historically; I use calculated L to reflect observed data. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 5 periods (recent_N, N=5) so the OR engine will size orders to cover the shorter recent demand trend while the pipeline (819) already covers ~5\xd7recent mean (\u2248758), avoiding excess holding. This balances service level (cover current volatility) versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date=2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand has moderated vs earlier spikes; last 3 observed demands (Periods 23-25) = [171,83,109], recent avg=121. Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show 4-period actual lead time, so use default L. To keep service vs holding balanced with current on-hand=265 and in-transit=445, use a short recent_N forecast to capture the recent lower regime (N=3 \u2192 (1+L)*mean focuses ordering on near-term demand). sigma_hat uses the same recent_N=3 to reflect recent volatility. These params reduce excess ordering compared to using the longer-term mean.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent demand has moderated versus the mid-May spike: last 4 concluded weekly demands (Periods 23-26) = [171,83,109,139], recent mean=125.75. On-hand=126 + in-transit=445 => pipeline=571 units, while (1+L)=5 periods of recent demand \u2248 628.75, so pipeline is slightly short (~58 units). Lead times have consistently observed =4 in concluded history. I choose L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual LT=4, and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to respond to the recent lower-demand regime so the OR engine orders for the near-term regime and avoids excess holding cost.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Current on-hand=100, in-transit=294 (pipeline total=394). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so promised L=4 is reliable. Recent demand has been variable but no new 3+ period sustained regime change since previously recorded shifts, so use default demand estimates (based on full-sample mean from provided historical weekly samples). Using defaults keeps the OR backend anchored to long-run sample moments while the confirmed L=4 aligns ordering timing with observed arrivals. No shipments appear overdue beyond the confirmed lead time; pipeline plus on-hand provides several weeks of cover, so defaults balance service vs holding costs conservatively.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand volatile but trending moderately above early-year lows (recent demands P24-P28 = 83,109,139,234,175). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages (multiple P conclude entries showing ordered\u2192arrived with W=4), so use observed average. To capture recent regime and current volatility I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and std (focus on last 5 realized demands: periods 24-28). This keeps pipeline sizing responsive while the OR backend applies the base-stock and cap logic given promised L. On-hand 162 + in-transit 348 provides coverage; using recent_N helps avoid overstock from older high outliers while reflecting the recent uptick in mid-summer demand.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand has shown regime shifts earlier in year, but no new sustained change in the last 3 concluded periods that would justify altering demand or lead-time estimates. Given strong pipeline coverage and confirmed LT=4, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies full-sample statistics and caps orders appropriately to avoid excess holding costs.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=818 units. Observed concluded lead times have consistently been 4 periods historically; I will use the promised/default lead time. With L=4 the review+lead horizon is 5 periods; current pipeline (818) comfortably covers multiple periods of recent demand but we should adapt demand estimates to recent weeks (lower than earlier peaks). I select recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the most recent demand regime and reduce overstock risk while the large in-transit position amortizes service risk. These parameters balance service (pipeline covers shortfall) against holding cost by lowering the target base stock to recent demand levels.

I set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual LT=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the current higher-demand regime; same recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the higher recent demand while acknowledging confirmed lead time and existing in-transit inventory (822 units \u2248 covers most but slightly below 5-period demand at recent mean).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-23 (Period 33). On-hand=144, in-transit=586 -> healthy pipeline but recent weekly demand has softened (Periods 30-32 demands = 191,195,147; recent 3-week avg ~177.7). Historical data shows lead time consistently 4 periods; no new sustained changepoint detected. To keep service while reducing holding, use promised lead time (default) and set demand forecast to recent behavior using the last 3 weeks (captures recent drop vs earlier spikes). sigma also set to recent 3-week volatility to reflect lower recent variance. This reduces target base-stock vs using full-history mean, lowering holding risk while maintaining service given ample pipeline.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=150, in-transit=515 (total pipeline=665). Recent 5 demands (Periods 29-33) = [140,191,195,147,224], 5-period average demand \u2248179.4, so (1+L)*avg \u2248897 units \u2014 pipeline+on-hand (665) is short for the review+lead horizon. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so keep promised/default. To adapt to the recent lower-than-long-run mean and capture current regime, use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=5 respects min 3 and captures the latest demand regime). This raises target base-stock to cover recent demand while sigma from recent volatility controls safety stock and avoids excessive holding given equal profit/holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). On-hand=252, in-transit=492. Historical concludes consistently show orders arriving with 4-period lag (multiple confirmed arrivals), so use calculated lead time reflecting observed history. Recent demand (Periods 31-35: 195,147,224,100,99) shows a new short-term regime; I use recent_N=5 to focus the forecast on current demand level (avg\u2248153 over review+lead). sigma_hat also set to recent_N=5 to capture current volatility. These choices keep L aligned with observed deliveries and shrink forecast to recent demand to avoid excess holding given equal profit and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21 (Period 37). Recent on-hand=237, in-transit=458; promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. Recent demand has trended down over the last 3 periods (Periods 34-36 demands = 100,99,70). To avoid excess holding cost given profit=holding cost, I bias the forecast toward the short recent regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 to capture the most recent lower demand level across the review+lead horizon. Set sigma_hat using recent_N N=3 to reflect recent volatility and keep safety stock aligned with recent variability.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent on-hand=508 + in-transit=67 provides ample coverage vs typical weekly demand; many past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time=4 historically. No recent sustained (3+ period) demand regime change detected since prior insights. I therefore use promised lead time (default). I also use default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*overall mean and sqrt(1+L)*overall std, which is appropriate given no strong new signal and to avoid overreacting to short recent dips. This keeps service levels high while the backend's cap limits excessive single-period orders and balances holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=521, in-transit=244 \u2192 ample immediate coverage but recent weekly demand has been depressed vs mid-year spikes. Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently 4 periods. To keep safety responsive to recent demand regime and reduce overstock risk, set lead time based on observed history and forecast demand from the most recent windows (captures latest seasonality/trend). Using recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the backend compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean and volatility across the latest data while L='calculate' ensures lead time reflects observed arrivals (4). This balances service (protects against runouts if demand rebounds) and holding cost (uses recent lower demand to lower base stock).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=525, in-transit=223 (ample coverage vs recent low demand). Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments. Recent weeks show falling demand into November, so remain conservative and use default statistics to let OR backend compute base stock with promised lead time. Methods: keep promised L (default) because observed lead time = promised and stable; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L), preserving stability and avoiding overfitting short-term noise. This balances service level vs holding cost given equal profit/holding (q=0.5 => z*=0).

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=504, in-transit=243. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show observed lead_time=4 (many P conclude entries with W=4), so use calculated lead time to reflect confirmed performance. Recent demand has dropped sharply in the last 3 concluded periods (Periods 39-41: demand=33,17,21) versus the longer-run averages and earlier regime shifts; to avoid overstocking given equal profit and holding cost, I downweight older high-demand periods and base mu_hat and sigma_hat on the most recent regime (3 weeks) so the OR backend reduces target base stock and variance. No new sustained multi-period pattern beyond the recent low-demand window, so no new carry-over insight.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand has fallen sharply over the last 4 weeks (Periods 39\u201342). On-hand=436, in-transit=243 => pipeline=679 units which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at the new low demand. No evidence of lost shipments; historical concluded arrivals confirm a stable 4-period actual lead time. I set L to default (promised 4) and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to quickly adapt the forecast and volatility to the recent low-demand regime while avoiding overstock. This reduces target base-stock and holding cost given high current inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 39 to Period 42: 4-week avg=34.75 vs overall avg=225 (-84.5%); sustained 4 periods of low demand.

On-hand=639, in-transit=20 \u2192 pipeline=659, which already comfortably covers (1+L) periods of the low demand. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods. To avoid overstock given holding cost equal to profit, I use a recent-regime demand estimate (last 4 weeks) for both mean and volatility so the OR engine targets much lower base stock aligned with the sustained drop.

On-hand is high (624) with 20 in-transit, so avoid aggressive replenishment. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history, so use calculated average lead time. Use recent_N demand estimates over the most recent low-demand regime (N=6) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current low-volume pattern and reduce ordering to limit holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Recent weeks show sustained low demand (Period 39-45 weekly demand mostly 33\u219220\u219217\u219221\u219268\u219220\u219215\u219220 with last 4 weeks avg \u224817.5). On-hand=624, in-transit=0; with promised lead time 4, (1+L)=5 so on-hand alone covers >5 weeks of current low demand. Observed lead times consistently 4 periods in concluded messages. I select L by calculating average observed lead times to confirm the 4-period reality. For demand I use a recent_N estimate (N=4) to capture the sustained low-demand regime and avoid over-ordering; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect reduced recent volatility. These choices tell the OR backend to target a lower base stock aligned to the recent low-demand regime and lower variability, reducing unnecessary holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Recent demand has been at a lower regime since Period 39 (Nov) with weekly demand mostly in the 15\u201368 range; current on-hand=595, in-transit=0 (no overdue arrivals). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and sustained low demand, set L based on observed lead times and use recent-demand estimates (regime since Period 39) for mu/sigma. I choose L=calculate to confirm the observed 4-period lead time; mu_hat recent_N using the last N=8 periods (regime length) to forecast (1+L)-period demand conservatively; sigma_hat recent_N with N=8 to reflect current low-demand volatility. This reduces base-stock target relative to long-run averages and limits ordering while meeting service level for current regime.
