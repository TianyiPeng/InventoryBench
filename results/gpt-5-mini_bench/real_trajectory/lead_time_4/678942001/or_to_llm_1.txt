Demand & seasonality: Historical weekly samples show a clear downward trend (346,235,196,176,172) and today is 2019-02-11 (winter in many markets) which is not favorable for a short-sleeve top\u2014anticipate lower near-term demand. OR baseline: OR computed cap-driven recommendation of 344 units based on treating demand mean \u2248225/week and L=4; with profit=holding the critical fractile is 0.5, so OR leaned to avoid stockouts equally with avoiding overstock. Adjustment decision: Because demand shows a steady decline and holding cost equals profit (high penalty for overstock), I will be conservative and reduce the OR recommendation substantially. I place a one-time replenishment of 200 units to provide stock for immediate sales while limiting holding risk if the downward trend continues. This retains some coverage in case demand stabilizes but avoids tying up inventory for a long lead time that may not be met with high demand.
