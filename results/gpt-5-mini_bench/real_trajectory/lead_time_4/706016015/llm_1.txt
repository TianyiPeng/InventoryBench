Historical lead-time evidence: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (arrivals consistently match 4-period lag). Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 177, in-transit = 1100 (the 1100 was ordered on P43 and will arrive within this lead-time window). Ordering policy: must cover (L+1)=5 future weeks of demand. Five-week demand \u2248 5\xd7143 = 715 units. Current pipeline (on-hand + in-transit = 1277) already >715, so no new order required.
