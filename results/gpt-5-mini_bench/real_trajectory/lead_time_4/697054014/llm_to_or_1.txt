Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (weekly cadence). Recent 5 weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show stable downward drift but no sustained regime change; on-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so no arrivals expected this period. No concluded arrivals to suggest lead-time deviations or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and full-sample demand stats: keep L=default so backend uses promised 4 periods; use mu_hat=default to capture (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples; use sigma_hat=default to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (protect vs. 4-period coverage) while avoiding overreaction to minor recent dips.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=133 (Period1 order 133 shows arrived=0 in Period1 conclude -> no concluded arrivals yet, so cannot infer actual lead time or lost shipment). Recent observed demand: Period1 demand=117 plus historical weekly samples (132,103,92,87,80). No sustained changepoint detected. Use promised lead time to avoid premature adjustments. Select default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample set, letting OR engine balance service level vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=268, two recent concluded periods show orders placed but no arrivals yet (within promised lead time). Historical weekly samples (5) show mean demand ~99; recent realized demands (P1=117, P2=169) are noisy but not yet a sustained regime shift. No concluded arrivals to infer lead time change or lost shipments. Use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand/volatility (use full-sample statistics) so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation while awaiting clearer evidence of a demand or lead-time change.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~99.0 and no concluded arrivals yet; promised lead time is 4 and there is no concluded evidence to change it. On-hand=0, in-transit=431 covers several weeks of demand given mean ~99 but arrivals will only be visible after their arrival conclude. Use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling and its safety-stock formula while avoiding premature adjustments for unconfirmed lead-time shifts or demand regime changes.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=600 (orders from P1-P4). No arrivals have concluded yet \u2014 consistent with promised L=4 (orders will conclude in future periods). Historical weekly demand samples (132,103,92,87,80) produce mean ~98.8/week. I use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand moments so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this keeps policy aligned with historical baseline while the in-transit pipeline resolves and avoids overreacting to missing concludes.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods1-5): 117,169,150,157,96 \u2014 elevated vs. older Jan samples. On-hand=37, in-transit=592 (several outstanding orders). One concluded arrival shows actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192Period5). I use L=default (promised 4) since observed lead time matches promise. To emphasize recent demand regime, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=5 (uses the last 5 demand samples) so the OR engine targets current higher variability and mean. This balances service (capture recent demand spike) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period1 order arrived in Period5: arrived=133, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). Recent demand samples (historical weeks: 132,103,92,87,80) show mean ~98.8; observed concluded demands in Periods 5\u20136 were 96 and 102, consistent with baseline. On-hand=70, in-transit=629 (multiple prior orders concluding with observed lead_time=4). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (recent concludes confirm LT=4). I select default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples \u2014 this leverages the stable historical mean and recent confirms, while the calculated L ensures the pipeline coverage (1+L periods) matches actual lead time and reduces risk of stockouts given large in-transit quantity.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1927.00

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Lead time evidence: three concluded arrivals show orders from Periods 1-3 each arriving with lead_time=4 \u2192 actual lead time confirmed at 4. Recent demand has softened: Periods 5-7 demands = 96, 102, 108 (avg 102) vs earlier higher values (e.g. P2-P4 ~150s). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (captures confirmed L=4). For demand I use recent_N N=3 (Periods 5-7) to reflect the newer, lower regime; mu_hat will be (1+L)*mean(last3) so the OR backend stocks for the 5-period review+lead window using recent demand. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=3 to capture volatility in the most recent regime. These choices reduce overstock risk from older, higher-demand samples while respecting confirmed lead time and protecting service level across the 5-period horizon.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Recent demand (Periods 5-8) = [96,102,108,151], showing a modest upward shift versus historical Jan samples (mean ~98.8). On-hand=143, in-transit=297 -> pipeline + on-hand = 440, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of demand at L=4. Observed concluded lead times = four observations of 4 periods; use calculated lead time to reflect confirmed pattern. For demand forecast use recent_N over the last 4 concluded demand samples to capture the emerging higher regime (N=4). For sigma, use recent_N N=4 to reflect recent variability including the large week of 151. These choices give the OR backend a short-term higher mean and updated variability while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence; this balances service level (avoiding stockouts during rising demand) against holding cost given healthy pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods for prior orders. On-hand=170, in-transit=328 (pipeline total=498) which roughly matches demand forecast for review+lead window. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed evidence; use default demand & volatility (all-sample) to leverage full historical sample mean (5 weeks) because no sustained demand regime shift is evident and pipeline covers the (1+L) demand. This balances service (coverage ~equal to forecast) versus holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. On-hand=258, In-transit=322. Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (Period1\u2192P5, Period2\u2192P6, etc.) which matches promised L=4. No sustained demand regime shift (recent demands vary without a clear new mean); pipeline plus on-hand already provides strong coverage. I therefore use default lead time and default demand estimates (use all historical samples) so the OR engine applies its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std calculations. This keeps safety stock driven by long-run stats and avoids overreacting to short noisy spikes, balancing service level against $1 holding cost given $19 profit.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded history shows a stable actual lead time of 4 periods (confirmed in Period 6) and sustained weekly demand around the historical sample mean (~98.8). Current on-hand=135 and in-transit=426 provide substantial pipeline coverage; no evidence of lost shipments since multiple prior orders concluded with lead_time=4. Profit ($19) >> holding ($1) implies a high service-level target, so use demand estimates that cover the full review+lead horizon. Set L by calculation from observed lead times; use default demand and volatility estimators based on the full sample set to give the OR backend a stable (1+L)-scaled mean/SD for base-stock computation.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=10, in-transit=548 (ample pipeline). Recent realized weekly demand (last 5 concluded periods) = [151,98,84,123,125], mean \u2248116.2 \u2014 higher than the long-run Jan samples, so use recent_N to capture current regime. Promised lead time is 4 and recent evidence confirms 4; keep default lead time to align with backend. Using recent_N N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine size the (1+L) forecast and variability to current demand while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes. This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (arrival pattern P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). On-hand=77, in-transit=511 provides ample pipeline but several late/no arrivals occurred in Periods 11-12 (arrived=0) before arrivals resumed, so be conservative and use promised lead time. Set L to default (use promised 4). Demand history is stable around ~100/wk from provided samples and recent periods; use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting OR engine produce capped orders that balance profit vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (multiple arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand = 139, in-transit = 432 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand = 571 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at typical weekly demand (~100s). Profit $19, holding $1 implies service-focused policy (high critical fractile). I use default lead time (promised L=4) since concluded data confirms it, and default demand moments to let the OR engine compute base-stock from the full sample set. Using defaults avoids overfitting to short recent variability while the pipeline already provides substantial cover.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/27 (Period 16). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). Current inventory: on-hand=132, in-transit=426. Historical demand samples (Jan 2019) mean \u224898.8/wk. I use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set. This balances service (use 5-week demand window given L=4) against low holding cost ($1 vs profit $19) without overfitting to recent noise or transient arrival gaps.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). On-hand=279, in-transit=313. Carry-over shows lead time confirmed=4. Recent realized weekly demand has fallen versus the Jan samples (recent demands P14-P18 = 104,111,64,55,62) indicating a lower demand regime. I therefore keep L as default (use promised/confirmed 4) and base demand forecasts on the most recent regime using recent_N with N=5 (captures the last 5 weeks P14-P18). Using recent_N for sigma captures current lower volatility. These choices keep pipeline aligned to the current lower-demand regime and avoid excess overstock while preserving service level given confirmed lead time and substantial in-transit inventory.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent weekly demand samples (historical: 132,103,92,87,80) show a steady modest level (mean=98.8). On-hand=335, in-transit=215 -> pipeline+on-hand=550, which exceeds (1+L)*mean demand (\u2248494) so no additional safety increase needed. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior periods, and profit/holding (19/1) implies a high target service level but current inventory already provides coverage. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes base-stock consistent with long-run sample stats while avoiding extra holding cost given already ample pipeline.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). On-hand=413, in-transit=199. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P5/P6 evidence). Recent demand has declined versus the early-sample mean: last 5 concluded weekly demands = {64,55,62,42,30}, mean=50.6, indicating a sustained lower-demand regime. I set L to default (promised=4). For demand forecast I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the lower recent mean across the review+lead window (1+L=5). Volatility also uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent lower-variance behavior. These choices reduce over-ordering versus the long-run mean while preserving service given the confirmed 4-period lead time and current healthy on-hand + pipeline.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Historical weekly demand samples (early 2019) average ~98.8 units; recent concluded periods show lower actual weekly demand (30\u201362 range) but not enough sustained evidence to declare a new demand regime. On-hand=432, in-transit=141 \u2014 pipeline well stocked versus typical weekly demand. No overdue/lost shipments visible; previous confirmation of 4-period lead time exists. Using promised lead time and default demand/volatility estimators keeps the OR backend conservative, avoids overreacting to short recent dips, and balances service level vs holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=463, in-transit=112. Historical weekly samples mean=98.8 (samples:132,103,92,87,80). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history; with high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) we favor the backend's default base-stock sizing ((1+L)\xd7mean) to maintain service while limiting extra inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has fallen materially vs. the Jan samples. Historical sample mean (Jan weeks) \u224898.8 units. Periods 17\u201325 demand avg = 41.9 (9 samples), a sustained \u224857.6% decline beginning Period 17. Pipeline: on-hand=424, in-transit=145. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes. I set L to default (promised 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 to anchor the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility to the new low-demand regime; this reduces target base-stock and avoids excess holding cost while preserving service for current demand levels.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 17: avg demand decreased from ~98.8 (Jan samples) to 41.9 (Periods 17\u201325), a \u221257.6% change (9-period evidence).

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a confirmed lead time of 4 periods and a sustained lower-demand regime starting Period 17 (Periods 17\u201325 average \u224841.9, 9-period evidence). On-hand=417 + in-transit=89 gives 506 units, which is ample against reduced demand but holding cost is low ($1) so avoid overstock. Set L to default (promised 4, confirmed). For demand and volatility use recent_N with N=9 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (use last 9 samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std), which tightens base-stock and reduces unnecessary orders while preserving service level given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history shows a sustained lower-demand regime since Period 17 (~41.9 avg) and confirmed actual lead time = 4 from prior concludes. Current inventory: on-hand=348, in-transit=62 (ample coverage). To keep the OR engine aligned with promised lead time and the long-run sample statistics, use default lead time and default demand/volatility (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples). This avoids overreacting to a single high recent sale (Period 27 demand=96) while letting the backend cap orders to control holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). On-hand=308, in-transit=188. Profit/holding implies very high service target (q\u22480.95). Historical data and provided carry-over show a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 17 (mean dropped \u2248\u221257.6% vs Jan samples) \u2014 recent lower demand persists through Period 28. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods repeatedly. Therefore: keep L as promised (default=4) to match confirmed lead time; forecast demand using recent regime data to avoid overstocking from earlier high-demand Jan samples. I select recent_N with N=12 (Periods 17\u201328) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the lowered, stable regime and its volatility; this balances high service target with reduced mean to limit holding costs given already-large on-hand + pipeline.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Observed actual lead time confirmed as 4 in history and demand dropped since Period 17 but recent weeks (Periods 25\u201329) show higher volatility and elevated demand vs the low regime. On-hand=265 + in-transit=155 gives ample coverage short-term; to keep service while limiting holding cost I use promised lead time (default) and base demand forecasts on the most recent 5 weeks to capture the recent uptick/volatility.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 17 (avg ~41.9 since P17 vs ~98.8 before). On-hand=162, in-transit=155 (total pipeline=317) \u2014 ample coverage but avoid overstock. Use promised lead time (default L=4). For demand forecast and volatility, use recent_N over the post-changepoint regime (Periods 17\u201330) to reflect the lower mean and recent variability (regime length 14); this reduces target base-stock and holding cost exposure while preserving service.

Recent demand has rebounded since the low regime (Periods 26+), so I use a recent-window forecast to capture the new higher mean and short-term volatility. Choose L=default to trust promised lead time (and confirmed historically). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=6 (last 6 demand periods) to align (1+L)-period demand forecast with the recent uptick. Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=6 to reflect current volatility and avoid under/over-stocking given holding cost tradeoff.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). On-hand=60, in-transit=182. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5 etc.). Demand showed a sustained low regime P17\u2013P25 (~41.9 avg) but increased starting P26; recent 7-period demand (P26\u2013P32) is materially higher. To capture the new regime, set L to default (promised 4). For demand forecast use recent_N over the recent regime (N=7) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean over P26\u2013P32. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=7) to capture current volatility. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the confirmed lead time and recent demand uptick while avoiding stale long-term averaging that would under-order.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 26: avg demand rose from 41.9 (Periods 17\u201325) to ~95.0 (Periods 26\u201332), +~127% (7-period evidence)

Recent demand regime (Periods 26\u201332) averaged ~95 units; Period 33 showed a one-off spike (184) but not yet a sustained shift. To balance service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding overstock for a single spike, keep lead time at promised (default) and set demand forecast using recent_N=7 to reflect the most recent regime while smoothing the single-week spike. Use recent_N=7 for sigma to capture recent volatility.

Recent demand regime (Periods 26\u201334) averages ~95 with elevated variance and two large recent spikes (P33=184, P34=119). On-hand=0 + in-transit=499 provides coverage vs. (1+L) periods demand; keeping L inferred from observed history and using a recent-window demand estimate will let the OR backend target service while limiting excess holding. Set L by averaging observed lead times; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (regime length = 9 periods: P26\u2013P34) to capture the current higher-demand regime and its volatility.

Recent demand has jumped starting Period 33 (demands P33\u2013P35 = 184,119,99); I treat this as a recent high-demand regime and use the last 3 periods to forecast (short, pronounced spike). Set L to promised/default=4, mu_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture the elevated recent mean, and sigma_hat recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. This focuses the OR base-stock on recent demand spike while keeping lead time at the trusted promised value; it balances higher service needs now against holding cost given large in-transit stock.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has rebounded since Period 26 with strong volatility: last 7 concluded demands (Periods 30\u201336) = [103,132,125,184,119,99,177], avg \u2248134.1. On-hand=0, in-transit=695 (large pipeline arriving in future periods). Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 in concluded history. I set L=default (promised=4). I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=7 to capture the recent higher-demand regime while keeping responsiveness to demand swings; this balances service (higher base stock) vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent weeks (Periods 31\u201337) show a sustained uptick vs earlier regimes (demands: 132,125,184,119,99,177,135; mean\u2248138.7), and lead time has been confirmed as 4 historically. On-hand=5 and in-transit=655 (total pipeline=660) is ample but demand appears elevated; use recent_N=7 to capture the new higher-demand regime for both mu_hat and sigma_hat while keeping L at the promised/default (confirmed=4). These settings let the OR engine size base stock to meet the higher recent mean while sigma_hat reflects recent volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand has rebounded above prior regimes: last 6 concluded demands (P33\u2013P38) = 184,119,99,177,135,127 (avg ~140). On-hand=55, in-transit=626 (sufficient pipeline vs. L=4). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. I set L=default to use the promised/previously confirmed 4-period lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime I use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 6 samples; same recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect current volatility. These choices make the OR base-stock responsive to the recent uptick while respecting the confirmed lead time and large in-transit pipeline.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals). Recent demand has risen and become more volatile since the regime shifts noted earlier (Periods 26+ and large demands in Periods 33\u201339). On-hand = 117 and large in-transit = 600 provide ample pipeline cover; choose parameters that reflect recent higher demand while acknowledging confirmed L=4. Set L by calculated average of observed lead times (captures confirmed 4). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent high-demand regime (Periods 33\u201339), so the OR backend raises target base-stock appropriately while capping orders via its cap to avoid overshoot given large pipeline.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows the higher-demand regime (started Period 26) persists through Period 40 (sustained elevated weekly demand vs earlier low regime). On-hand=235 and in-transit=474 provide strong pipeline coverage but demand remains elevated; lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior conclude messages. To keep service while avoiding excess holding, use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates from the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N over the most recent 15 concluded samples (Periods 26\u201340) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine bases base-stock on the current, sustained regime rather than diluted long-run average.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent weeks show elevated weekly demand (~100+ with variability) versus earlier low-demand regime; on-hand=263, in-transit=374 (total pipeline=637) \u2014 ample cover. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods, so keep promised lead time. To capture the recent higher-demand regime (Periods 33\u201341) I use recent_N=9 for demand mean and volatility (covers the 9 most recent concluded demands) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the current demand level while the large pipeline will limit new orders via the OR cap. This balances high service level (q\u22480.95) against holding cost given already-high inventory.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 repeatedly and large recent demand volatility with elevated weekly sales (Nov spikes up to 178). Current on-hand=233 + in-transit=345 provides healthy coverage. To avoid stockouts through the 1+L review+lead window while keeping holding costs low, use promised lead time and default demand estimates (use full-sample mean and std across history). This balances service (captures recent high demand in the historical mean) against holding cost given already-large pipeline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=284, in-transit=270 \u2192 healthy pipeline but December seasonality and recent high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201343 show elevated and volatile demand vs earlier low regime). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; using promised/default lead time is consistent. I choose recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the most recent demand regime (9 most recent demand samples reflect the current higher-volume, higher-volatility environment) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet elevated December demand while keeping holding cost awareness via the capped order. This balances service level risk (avoid stockouts in holiday season) against holding costs given already-large on-hand inventory.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Recent history (Periods 26\u201344) shows a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 26 and confirmed elevated weekly sales through Dec; actual lead time has been consistently 4 in concluded history. On-hand=250 + in-transit=370 = 620 units, which provides cover vs (1+L) demand but I still bias forecast to recent regime to avoid stockouts during holiday weeks. Set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=19 periods, Periods 26\u201344) to capture the elevated mean and volatility since the regime change; this raises the base-stock to protect service level while the OR cap limits excessive ordering, balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23. Recent history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (multiple P conclude messages) and a sustained higher-demand regime since Period 26 (carry-over). On-hand=152, in-transit=453 (pipeline=605) \u2014 ample cover but high profit/low holding favors high service level. I keep L as default (promised 4). To capture the post-changepoint higher demand and recent variability I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (uses the most recent 20 demand samples to reflect the current regime and volatility), which lets the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances the high profit (q\u22480.95) against holding cost while adapting to the confirmed regime shift.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

Historical weekly samples (Jan 2019) mean \u224898.8 used as baseline. I keep L at the promised default (4) since lead time is confirmed. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, producing a stable base-stock that balances the $19 profit vs $1 holding cost and leverages the confirmed lead time and available pipeline to avoid stockouts while limiting excess holding given healthy pipeline.
