Treat L=4 for planning and assume in-transit currently 0; possible shipment loss cannot be inferred yet. d) Inventory & pipeline: on-hand 0, in-transit 0. Must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because orders placed now will not help until Period 6 arrival. e) Order logic: target coverage = 5 \xd7 expected weekly demand. Using a conservative demand estimate (~90/week) to account for downward trend but allowing modest Valentine uplift, target order = 5\xd790 = 450 units. Holding cost is low ($1) vs profit ($19), so prioritize service level to capture sales. Place order for 450 units to cover the next 5 periods.",

  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-23 (week before Christmas) \u2014 product is womens blouse (gift/seasonal relevance) so demand can be elevated short-term. Historical recent demand: P42=178 (promo/Black Friday), P43=93, P44=116, P45=98; longer-run regime (recorded) is the higher-demand regime since Period 30 (~136 avg) but recent weeks are mixed. Lead time evidence: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals). Current inventory: on-hand=101, in-transit=370 (these in-transit units are orders from P43-P45 and will arrive in future periods; none arrive during this current period decision). Pipeline + on-hand = 471 units. Requirement: order + on-hand + in-transit should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand. Even if demand is elevated for Christmas (estimate 120\u2013150/week), current pipeline covers ~94 units/week; to cover 5 periods at 130/week would need ~650 units \u2014 adding ~180 units now would arrive after the holiday (lead time 4), so won't help current-week service. Given holding cost $1/unit/period and strong existing pipeline, avoid placing new order to limit holding costs and risk of excess post-holiday inventory.",

  "rationale": "Date 2019-12-30 (week between Christmas and New Year). Product is a womens blouse\u2014demand strong in Fall and through holiday season but now tapering.

Forecast: recent demand has averaged ~100 units/period (Periods 43-46: 93,116,98,93 -> avg ~100). With lead_time=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (current period's demand occurs after ordering). Expected 5-period demand \u2248 5\xd7100 = 500 units. Shortfall = 500 - 378 = 122 units.
