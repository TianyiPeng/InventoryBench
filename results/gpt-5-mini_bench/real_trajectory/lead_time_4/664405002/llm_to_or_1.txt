Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 664405002 has on-hand=0, in-transit=0. No concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time change; historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean = (74+158+220+132+107)/5 = 138.2. Promised lead time 4 periods will be used. Using default methods lets the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level against holding cost given no new regime or shipment evidence.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). History: demand samples (74,158,220,132,107), Period 1 ordered=230 but arrived=0 (no concluded arrival yet). Insufficient evidence to infer an actual lead-time change (need \u22653 concluded arrivals beyond promised LT). In-transit=230 already covers multiple weeks of typical demand. I select default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand/volatility estimates based on all available samples to avoid overreacting to a single delayed arrival; this balances service (we keep existing pipeline) against holding cost.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=454 (matches orders 230+224). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unconfirmed; promised lead time=4 remains the best default. Recent observed demand (Period1 demand=157, Period2 demand=239) is higher than the older Jan samples (mean~138) but only 2 new periods \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. Use L=default (promised=4) so OR backend accounts for contract lead time. For mu_hat use recent_N with N=5 to bias forecast toward the most recent weeks while still using enough history to avoid overreacting to 2-point spike. Keep sigma_hat=default to let backend compute volatility from full sample set, avoiding overfitting to limited recent variance evidence. This balances service (higher recent demand) versus holding cost given large in-transit volume and uncertain actual lead time.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=722. Recent conclude messages show orders placed in Periods 1-3 with arrived=0, but promised lead time is 4 and none of those orders are yet due to have concluded\u2014no confirmed lead-time change. Historical demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) are the only demand signal available and no clear regime shift is observed. I therefore use default lead time (promised L=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the base-stock driven by the long-run sample mean/variance while avoiding premature adjustments for missing arrivals that are not yet overdue. On-hand + in-transit (722) will be reconciled by backend demand coverage calculations.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Demand history (5 samples) mean=138.2/wk, std used by backend. On-hand=0, in-transit=761; orders placed in Periods 1-4 have not concluded (arrived=0) despite promised lead_time=4 \u2014 indicates shipments are delayed or lost. Because no concluded arrivals exist, we cannot compute an observed average lead time; conservative response is to extend assumed lead time to cover ongoing delays so the OR backend builds a larger pipeline. Set L explicitly to 6 periods (longer than promised 4) to reflect delayed deliveries; keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as defaults so the backend uses all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively. This increases target base-stock to protect service level given missing arrivals while acknowledging holding cost is equal to profit so backend's q will be 0.5.

Carry-over insight: Missing/delayed shipments: orders from Periods 1-4 (placed P1-P4) have arrived=0 by their promised lead time=4 \u2014 sustained absence across 4 periods, treat lead time as effectively longer / potential lost shipments.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-58.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent concluded history shows a confirmed arrival: Period 5 conclude reports arrived=230 (ordered P1) => observed lead time = 4. On-hand 144 + in-transit 767 provides substantial coverage. Demand samples (weekly) show moderate variance; no clear recent demand regime shift. Given confirmed lead time evidence, use calculated lead time (avg observed). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples, balancing service vs holding cost with the OR engine's capped policy.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order placed P1 arrived P5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): on-hand=268, in-transit=543. Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1->arrived P5, P2->P6). Pipeline appears healthy (arrivals from earlier lost shipments have begun). Demand has shifted down vs. older historical samples; recent demands (P2-P6 = 239,130,105,86,100) average ~132. To reflect confirmed lead time and recent lower demand, set L by calculating observed lead times and set mu/sigma using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the new regime and reduce overstating demand. These parameters balance service (accounting for 1+L review+lead horizon) against holding cost by using short-window estimates after the detected demand decline.

Recent concludes show orders placed P1\u2013P3 arrived with lead_time=4 (consistent), earlier periods had delayed arrivals but lead time now confirmed at 4. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (reflecting confirmed L=4). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so backend uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) \u2014 conservative given equal profit/holding ($1/$1) and current healthy on-hand + pipeline to avoid overstocking while maintaining service.

Current inventory: on-hand=363, in-transit=236 (total pipeline+on-hand=599) versus recent weekly demand averaging ~125. Given confirmed LT=4 and no clear sustained demand regime shift, use calculated lead time (average of observed L) and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L) scaling to the long-run sample mean and std. This keeps service level aligned with observed lead time while avoiding overreacting to normal week-to-week demand noise.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent concluded history shows observed lead times consistently equal to 4 periods for orders that completed (e.g., P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9). Current inventory: on-hand=272, in-transit=254 \u2192 total pipeline=526. Historical demand samples (5 weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb) have mean=138.2. Using calculate for L (average observed lead times = 4) and default demand estimates keeps the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and uses all samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean for mu_hat and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std for sigma_hat. This balances service level (use full-sample mean over the (1+L) horizon) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory but pipeline still below the (1+L) demand forecast, so the backend can place additional orders as its capped policy dictates.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders with lead_time=4, most recently P9->P13), so use promised/default lead time. Demand historical samples (weekly) imply baseline demand; to let the OR backend compute base-stock from full-sample mean and variance and given symmetric profit/holding ($1/$1) I select default methods so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples. This keeps the policy conservative given current healthy on-hand + pipeline while relying on confirmed L=4.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=339, in-transit=215 (pipeline=554 total). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use observed lead time. Recent demand (Periods 5\u201314) shows a lower, stable regime (10 samples, mean\u224880.4) compared with the older 5-sample series; to reflect the current regime I use recent_N=10 for demand mean and volatility. Using L=calculate ensures the backend uses the observed average lead time; mu_hat recent_N=10 gives (1+L)\xd7mean based on the last 10 demand observations to reduce overstating demand; sigma_hat recent_N=10 uses recent volatility to set safety stock appropriately. This balances service (avoid stockouts given confirmed L=4) against holding cost by reducing reliance on older higher-demand samples.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Demand context: recent weekly demands have been moderate (50\u2013100 range) with no clear seasonal spike. Historical sample seed (provided) mean \u2248 158. On-hand=287, in-transit=186 -> pipeline + on-hand = 473 units; promised lead time=4. Concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P11 that later arrived all had lead_time=4); no sustained evidence of lost shipments since P1\u2013P11 eventually arrived. I choose L via calculate (use observed lead times) to let backend confirm average observed LT=4. For demand forecasting use default mu_hat and default sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this is appropriate because recent demand shows no sustained regime change and default uses full sample set to stabilise orders. This balances service level vs holding cost given profit=holding, aiming for moderate safety stock while avoiding excess inventory given already-large on-hand + pipeline.

Current on-hand=276, in-transit=186 \u2192 healthy pipeline but arrivals lag by 4 as confirmed. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality and let OR backend compute base_stock over (1+L) periods. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (all-sample mean/std scaled by 1+L) because no strong, sustained demand regime change is evident in the sales history; defaults keep forecasting stable while honoring confirmed lead time and balancing service vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/7/15 (Period 23). Recent realized lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals show lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=45, in-transit=393 \u2192 total pipeline=438. Recent demand (Periods 13-22) = [50,29,81,90,78,75,138,105,81,96], mean=82.3 units/week. With L\u22484, (1+L)=5 \u2192 forecasted demand over review+lead \u2248 5\xd782.3=411.5, which matches pipeline closely (438) indicating adequate cover. I choose L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual lead time=4; set mu_hat using recent_N=10 to capture the latest regime (no strong changepoint beyond last 10 periods); use default sigma_hat to reflect full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (q from profit/(profit+holding) = 0.5 \u2192 moderate z) without overstocking given holding cost=profit and substantial pipeline already inbound.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=105, in-transit=354. Historical conclude messages consistently show arrivals = orders placed 4 periods earlier (lead_time=4) since Period 5 onward \u2014 lead time confirmed as 4. I select L via 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead-time data (matches confirmed 4). Demand/volatility will use population statistics (default) so mu_hat and sigma_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples; this leverages all available demand history to balance service level (captures long-run mean) vs holding cost given profit=holding ($1/$1). Using defaults avoids overreacting to short fluctuations while respecting confirmed lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 periods (many arrivals indicate W=4). Current on-hand=132 and in-transit=313. Given confirmed LT=4 and no sustained demand regime change, use calculated lead time from observations and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from history.

Demand history shows a stable weekly pattern without a sustained recent regime change. Given confirmed lead time stability and no strong recent demand changepoint, use default (promised) lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use full historical sample) while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise; current pipeline + on-hand already covers several weeks of demand so no explicit inflation of mu_hat or sigma_hat is required.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently observed as 4 periods; arrivals after earlier temporary absences have since followed L=4. Current inventory: on-hand=194, in-transit=257 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand provides cushion vs typical weekly demand (historical sample mean ~138.2 over 5 weeks). I choose default methods so the OR backend uses promised lead time (4) and full-sample demand statistics to compute base-stock and caps; this keeps ordering conservative given profit=holding cost (q=0.5) and avoids overreacting to short-term shipment noise while the pipeline remains healthy.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead_time = 4 (many orders: ordered P -> arrived P+4). On-hand=206, in-transit=227 (large pipeline covering multiple weeks). Demand history stable around ~70\u2013140 weekly. Profit and holding cost equal ($1/$1) imply q=0.5 (balanced service vs holding). I choose L by 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time=4. Use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) which is appropriate given no recent sustained demand regime change and sufficient inventory coverage; this avoids overreacting to short noise and balances service level vs holding cost.

Demand context: recent weekly demand stable (~50\u2013100 range) per history; on-hand=186, in-transit=224 (no outstanding unexplained lost shipments; arrivals have consistently shown 4-period lead time). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (avg observed lead times \u22484).

I choose to use the promised/default lead time to match observed stable LT=4 and let the OR engine compute demand across (1+L) periods from all samples.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent conclude history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods; earlier missing arrivals resolved and no new sustained lead-time or demand regime shifts detected. Current inventory: on-hand=90, in-transit=308 \u2192 pipeline_total=398, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods of typical demand. Use default estimators (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to balance service level vs. holding cost given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Recent demand ~60\u2013100/week; historical seed samples mean \u2248138 (weekly) from provided series. On-hand=56, in-transit=326 \u2192 total pipeline=382 units, which is below (1+L)\xd7mean demand if L=4, so replenishment needed by backend. Past missing shipments resolved and lead time has been observed as 4 periods consistently; no new sustained changepoint detected. Therefore use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so OR backend applies its base-stock calculation with promised L=4 and historical demand stats.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=100, in-transit=314. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed P->P+4 observations). Demand in recent concluded periods is stable (~60\u201392/week). To keep policy aligned with observed lead time while letting the OR engine compute forecast from full history, I use calculated lead time (use observed lead times) and default demand/volatility methods so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service (using confirmed L=4) and holding cost without overfitting to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=85, in-transit=305. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. Demand context: recent weekly demand has ranged ~50\u2013100 (historical samples mean=138.2 for Jan reference). To keep the OR engine grounded in the promised/observed lead time and full-sample demand statistics, use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use full-sample mean across the review+lead window) against holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead_time=4 (many orders with lead_time=4). Set L to calculate (use observed lead times average) to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time.

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=8, in-transit=331. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 when observed; pipeline is large so service risk low. I set L to 'calculate' to let backend infer the observed average lead time from concluded history (will be 4). Demand has been stable around ~60\u2013130 recent periods; to reflect recent months I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the latest regime (balances service vs holding given profit=holding). This addresses any past missing shipments by relying on observed lead times and recent demand behavior rather than the original small sample prior.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand includes a single large spike (P42=308) but not a sustained regime change. Given equal profit and holding cost, use the backend's default broad-sample estimates so base-stock balances service vs holding using all available demand history. Pipeline (294) will be counted by the OR engine when computing final order against base stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09): on-hand=0, in-transit=420. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods since Period 5 onward. Recent demand shows elevation around late Nov (Periods 40-43: 104,130,308,85) suggesting a short-term higher-demand regime; to respond quickly I use a recent-demand estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat while using calculated L from observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time. This balances service (capture holiday lift) versus holding cost by raising target stock to cover the recent higher mean and measured volatility, while L calculated from observations avoids relying on promised lead time if discrepancies existed.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent history shows consistent observed lead time = 4 periods across many concluded arrivals; on-hand is 7 with 629 in-transit. Given confirmed stable lead time=4 and no sustained demand regime shift (demand history noisy but no multi-period structural change), use promised/default lead time so OR backend aligns with supplier promise. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample history; this leverages all historical demand while keeping parameters stable given large pipeline inventory and equal profit/holding costs which favor conservative stocking.

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Demand recent history shows weekly variability with occasional spikes (e.g., 308 in P42) but overall stable weekly demand; observed concluded arrivals consistently indicate actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=27 + in-transit=524 gives ample pipeline cover but demand variability and holiday season risk warrant using historical mean/variance. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level vs holding cost.

On-hand=12, in-transit=469; pipeline comfortably covers multi-period demand but recent history shows typical weekly demand ~60\u2013130 with one outlier (308 in P42) not sustained. Observed lead times in concluded history consistently 4 periods. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm the empirical 4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, reflecting full-sample demand estimates and keeping safety stock according to profit/holding cost tradeoff.
