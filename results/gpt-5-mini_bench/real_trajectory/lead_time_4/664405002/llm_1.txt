Lead-time & pipeline: Lead time is confirmed 4 periods. Current available coverage target = (L+1)=5 periods. Forecast 5-period demand \u22485\xd780=400 units. Inventory position: on-hand 109 + in-transit 321 = 430 units, which already covers ~5.4 weeks of expected demand. Holding cost equals profit ($1/unit/period), so excess inventory is costly. No overdue/lost orders evident. Action: place no order to avoid unnecessary holding costs while coverage > (L+1) forecasted demand.",
