Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. On-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals to infer actual lead time or lost shipments. Historical weekly samples (5): 557, 438, 489, 500, 649 \u2014 no sustained regime shift (only a single higher week). Promised lead time (4) will be used. Use default demand estimators so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this balances service (captures observed variability across the review+lead period) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=659 (order placed P1 not yet concluded). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time is unconfirmed; use promised lead time. Historical weekly demand samples mean=526.6 (5 samples). To be conservative and let OR engine use full history, choose default methods: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples), sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This provides a stable base-stock that balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost given modest holding cost relative to profit.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand mean \u2248526.6 (samples: 557,438,489,500,649). Two recent orders (659,649) remain in-transit (1308) and no arrivals have been concluded yet \u2014 insufficient evidence to change promised lead time (need \u22653 periods of missing/arrived data). Use default methods so backend applies promised L and full-sample demand stats: this preserves the cap that produced the recent orders (~659) and balances high profit (q\u22480.95) against holding cost while awaiting realized lead-time evidence.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent observed weekly demand samples: [557,438,489,500,649], mean=526.6. On-hand=0, in-transit=1949 which equals orders placed in Periods 1-3; no arrivals have concluded so actual lead time is unobserved. I use default lead time (promised L=4) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different L. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical data while the pipeline is monitored for missing shipments. This balances service level (covering 5 periods of demand) against holding cost given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Mar) average ~512 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=2582 (orders placed P1\u2013P4) and no concluded arrivals yet\u2014this is consistent with promised lead time = 4 (orders placed earlier will conclude in upcoming periods); no sustained changepoint in demand or confirmed lead-time shift (need \u22653 periods of confirmed evidence). Use default promised lead time and default demand/stat methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Daily Reward (R_t): $8621.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent realized demand (Periods 1-5) averaged ~487.8 units/week and volatility appears stable. Concluded arrivals show an order placed in Period 1 arrived in Period 5 \u2192 actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=195 + in-transit=2157 gives a large pipeline but many in-transit orders have not yet concluded; assume promised lead time holds. I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent 5 realized weekly demands (captures slight downshift vs older historical samples). Sigma set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent observed volatility. These parameters balance service (use recent demand mean across review+lead period) against holding cost given substantial pipeline\u2014recent statistics prevent overreacting to older higher-demand weeks.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6). On-hand=383, in-transit=1790 (total pipeline 2173) which comfortably covers multiple weeks of demand. I choose to let the OR engine use observed lead-time statistics (calculate) and default demand estimates so it leverages all historical samples for (1+L)-period demand and volatility; no explicit adjustments are required given confirmed lead time and ample pipeline. This balances service (profit/higher fill) versus holding cost by relying on the backend base-stock calculation and its cap.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent realized demand (Periods 5-7) = 464, 461, 542; historical sample mean = 526.6. On-hand 482 + in-transit 1732 = 2214 units available in pipeline. Observed arrivals confirm consistent lead time = 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). I select L by calculating the average observed lead times to reflect confirmed reality. For demand forecast I use the backend defaults ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to leverage the full historical sample set while the pipeline is ample; sigma uses default as well. This balances service (high profit relative to holding cost) against holding costs given large existing pipeline and confirmed L=4.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
2019-04-08: Recent demand has been elevated (last period 795) but not a sustained new regime; observed lead times in conclude messages are consistently 4. On-hand=320 + in-transit=1650 provides ample coverage for (1+L) periods. Use L calculated from observed lead times to confirm actual lead time=4, and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat (all-sample stats scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L)) to avoid overfitting to a single spike while the pipeline is large.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15. Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P5 all arrived with lead_time 4). On-hand = 16, in-transit = 2110 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple (L+1) periods of demand. Use calculated L based on observed lead times to confirm reality = 4. Use default demand estimates (all-sample mean scaled by 1+L) and default volatility to let the OR engine compute base-stock and cap from full-sample statistics; this leverages historical weekly samples while honoring the confirmed 4-period lead time and avoids overreacting to short-term spikes.

Daily Reward (R_t): $5662.00

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=0, In-transit=2516. Historical conclude messages consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4 (observed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10), so actual lead time is confirmed at 4. I set L using "calculate" to let backend average observed lead times (matches promised=4). Demand forecast and volatility use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; with confirmed L=4 this yields a base-stock calibrated to long-run demand while capping orders per its policy. This balances high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) by relying on full-sample estimates and the OR engine's cap to avoid excessive single-period receipts given large in-transit inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time=4 (arrivals from P1\u2013P7 all W=4). Demand samples (provided) show weekly demands ~438\u2013649; on-hand=198, in-transit=2385 \u2192 ample pipeline to cover (1+L) periods. Use promised/default lead time to match confirmed observations and use default demand/volatility calculations so OR backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This keeps service high while letting backend cap orders via its cap rule given large pipeline.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/05/06 (Period 13). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P8 arrived after 4 periods) and steady weekly demand (samples show mean ~526.6). Current on-hand=396 + in-transit=2186 gives large pipeline cover. I set L using calculate to reflect observed lead times (avg observed = 4). I choose mu_hat default and sigma_hat default so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples\u2014this leverages full historical demand while the calculated L ensures the base-stock covers the correct review+lead horizon and prevents underordering despite past delayed arrivals.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. Recent concluded demand shows a sustained higher regime vs the sparse 2019-Jan samples: last 9 concluded demands = [464,461,542,795,538,425,385,353,280], average ~471. Use L=default (promised lead time 4, confirmed by prior conclude). To capture the recent demand regime I select recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts (1+L)*recent_mean and volatility from the recent 9 weeks. This balances service (high profit-to-holding ratio \u2192 target ~95% service) while avoiding overstating variability from older samples. On-hand (810) + in-transit (1814) is ample, but parameters reflect current demand to prevent future stockouts if momentum continues.

I choose default methods for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all historical samples; this is conservative given pipeline slightly below (1+L)\xd7mean of the provided samples but recent demand has been variable. Default settings let the OR engine balance service vs holding cost using full-sample stats and the promised lead time.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=956, in-transit=1392; pipeline + on-hand well above expected near-term demand but we must respect observed lead time. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period arrivals (confirmed previously). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. Recent demand (last ~8 conclude periods) centers around ~450/week with some volatility; to bias the forecast to current regime I use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most recent 8 demand samples. This keeps service high while limiting extra holding given large on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed repeatedly: orders placed P1\u2013P12 arrived after 4 periods).

Inventory (on-hand + in-transit = 1952) comfortably covers multiple weeks of demand. Use promised/confirmed lead time to keep OR backend aligned with observed deliveries. Select default methods so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level (high profit $19 vs $1 holding) without manually overriding demand or volatility estimates.

On-hand=710, in-transit=1483 provides substantial pipeline cover. I choose default lead time (use promised 4) and default demand estimates so the backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std; this leverages the full sample set given no recent sustained demand regime shift and adheres to confirmed lead-time behavior.

On-hand=665 and in-transit=1738 provide substantial pipeline cover. Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in history, so use promised/default L. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the recent lower-demand regime and reduce overstating future demand; this balances service (avoid stockouts) against holding cost given high pipeline and current on-hand stock.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Current on-hand=848, in-transit=1281 \u2192 ample pipeline (total 2129) vs recent weekly demands (historic samples and recent history show weekly demand typically 280\u2013795, recent weeks ~274\u2013486). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service level (profitable:profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding ad-hoc manual overrides given stable regime and confirmed LT=4.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no evidence of lost shipments. Profit $19 vs holding $1 implies very high target service level (q=19/20). I therefore use the promised lead time (default) and let the OR engine compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the full sample history (default methods).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=967, in-transit=1532. Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (sustained evidence P1\u2192P5 and P1\u2013P12 arrivals). Demand has shifted from earlier ~500s to a sustained lower regime (~300s) across many recent weeks; to capture this I use recent demand stats. Select L=default to keep promised 4-period lead time (matches observed concludes). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L) forecast on the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the lower recent mean). Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce overstating demand (lower holding cost) while preserving service given confirmed 4-period lead time.

Demand history shows no recent sustained regime shift. Use promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so backend uses full sample mean/variance across available data; this keeps orders conservative given high on-hand + in-transit and avoids overreacting to single delayed arrival (one conclude showed arrived=0 but not sustained). Defaults balance service level (high profit per unit) against holding cost by relying on long-run mean and variance.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=1394, in-transit=989 (total 2383). Using the provided historical demand samples (mean \u2248526.6/week), (1+L)*mean \u22485*526.6=2633 \u2014 pipeline+on-hand (2383) is slightly below the 5-period demand estimate, but not drastically. I therefore use the default/promoised lead time and default demand statistics so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation (base_stock = (1+L)*mean + z*\xb7\u03c3\u0302) and capped order rule; this balances service level versus holding cost given confirmed LT=4 and historical samples.

Recent concluded history shows stable weekly demand (historical samples mean ~526.6) and confirmed lead time = 4 periods repeatedly; on-hand=1286, in-transit=921 (healthy pipeline). No evidence of a new demand regime or lost shipments. Use promised lead time and population-wide demand estimates so the OR engine's base-stock and cap computations rely on full-sample mean/variance (balances service level given profit=$19 vs holding=$1).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent weeks show steady demand around ~300\u2013415 (much lower than Jan samples). On-hand=1240, in-transit=1024 provides large pipeline coverage. Historical conclude messages repeatedly confirm 4-period actual lead time. To reflect the recent lower-demand regime I use a recent_N demand forecast to downweight high Jan values while keeping lead time at promised/confirmed 4. This reduces overstock risk while the large pipeline already provides service coverage. Methods selected: L=default to keep confirmed promised lead time; mu_hat=same-period+lead forecast from the most recent demand regime using recent_N=20 samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N=20 to capture recent volatility for safety stock calculation.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirms P1\u2192P5, P1\u2013P12 pattern). On-hand=974 + in-transit=988 provides ample coverage vs. typical weekly demand (~300\u2013500); no sustained demand regime shift detected in recent periods. I therefore use the default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand uncertainty methods so the OR engine applies (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std based on all samples; this leverages the long, stable demand history and the confirmed lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

On-hand=792, in-transit=1259 gives ample pipeline but demand history (weekly samples) should guide stocking. Profit $19 vs holding $1 implies high service target; using default methods leverages full sample mean/variance with promised lead time (4) so backend computes base stock and cap accordingly. No evidence of recent demand regime shift or lost shipments beyond confirmed LT=4, so keep defaults.

Historical sample mean=526.6/wk (5 samples provided). I use L=default (promised lead time 4, confirmed by concluded arrivals). I use mu_hat=default so backend will set demand across review+lead = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to reflect long-run weekly average and keep orders aligned with historical demand. I use sigma_hat=default so backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). No evidence of a new sustained demand or lead-time shift requiring an override; keeping defaults balances service level vs holding cost given confirmed LT and steady historical demand.

Pipeline + on-hand is large relative to typical weekly demand (historical weekly demand ~400s), so no corrective increase to forecast or safety stock is needed. Use promised/default lead time to match supplier promise and past confirmations.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = promised 4 periods (confirmed multiple times). Current inventory: on-hand=561, in-transit=1785 \u2014 ample pipeline relative to typical weekly demand (historical samples mean used by default). No recent missing shipments observed in concluded history. I choose default lead time to keep promised L=4, and default demand/volatility so the OR backend uses full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This balances service (high pipeline) with holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand context: historical weekly samples available and long series showing stable weekly demand ~300\u2013550 with occasional spikes (e.g. Period 33 demand=781). On-hand=668, in-transit=1646 \u2192 ample pipeline (total 2314) covering multiple weeks. Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes. I choose default lead time (use promised 4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This conservative choice leverages confirmed LT=4, avoids overfitting recent spikes, and lets the backend cap orders to limit excessive holding cost while maintaining service given current large pipeline.

LLM Rationale:

Profit/holding (19/1) implies high service-level but given stable history and confirmed LT=4 I use the backend defaults so the OR engine computes base stock from the full sample history. Default methods keep decisions aligned with observed stable demand and confirmed lead time while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Demand history shows stable weekly sales with confirmed lead time = 4 periods across many observed concludes. On-hand=1109, in-transit=1260 -> healthy pipeline. Use promised/observed lead time (4) and default demand estimates (all-sample mean & std scaled by (1+L)) so the OR backend computes base-stock and cap using full history; this balances service level (high pipeline) with low holding cost given large on-hand inventory and stable demand.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent history shows consistent observed lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier); on-hand=1136 + in-transit=1167 provides strong coverage versus typical weekly demand. I choose default lead time (promised 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std). This is conservative given stable demand and confirmed lead time; it balances service level (avoid stockouts) with holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=1169, in-transit=1151. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmations through Period 17 and thereafter). No recent evidence of lost shipments or a demand regime shift: weekly demand history remains in the same range. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised lead time and stable demand, use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history. This balances service (profit $19 vs holding $1) by letting the engine set the safety stock via its q = profit/(profit+holding) rule while respecting observed L=4.

Daily Reward (R_t): $25824.00

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/2 (Period 43). Recent history shows lead time reliably 4 periods; latest demand spike (Period 42 = 1366) is a single-week extreme, not a sustained regime shift (needs \u22653 periods). On-hand=130 + in-transit=1086 provides large pipeline cover. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (uses confirmed 4 by history), use default mu_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to avoid overreacting to a one-off spike, and default sigma_hat to reflect historical volatility. This balances service (maintain coverage given long pipeline) against holding cost and avoids over-ordering for a single-week anomaly.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). On-hand=113, in-transit=1548 \u2014 very large pipeline relative to recent weekly demand (historical samples ~280\u2013795, with one isolated spike at Period 42). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in conclude history; no sustained demand regime shift (spike at P42 is singular). To avoid excess holding cost while preserving service, use promised/default lead time and population-wide demand estimates: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). This tells the OR engine to compute a base-stock tied to long-run mean while the large in-transit inventory will naturally cap any new order size.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Demand history shows sustained weekly sales with a confirmed 4-period lead time across many concluded orders. Current on-hand=4, in-transit=2053 \u2014 ample pipeline but visible inventory arrives with 4-period lag. No recent sustained demand regime change detected (spikes in late Nov were one-off). To let the OR backend use full historical demand moments and the promised lead time, I choose default lead time and default demand moments so base-stock calculation uses all samples; this avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the large pipeline covers near-term service. Defaults balance service level (use long history) against holding cost given high in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). On-hand=32, in-transit=2503 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Given substantial pipeline and long stable demand history, use promised/default lead time and population-based demand estimates so the OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance. This avoids overreacting to recent fluctuations and prevents excess ordering while pipeline clears. Default mu_hat and sigma_hat will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, balancing service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) and holding cost risk.
