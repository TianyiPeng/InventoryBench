However the history shows four consecutive periods with zero observed arrivals despite 970 units reported as in-transit; this matches the provided carry-over suspicion of delayed/lost shipments and implies risk that much or all of the pipeline will not be available when needed. Demand estimate: recent weekly demands = [84, 121, 108, 136], mean = 112.25 units/week. OR's base-stock logic (using promised L) yields a much larger replenishment but caps to 27 this period; that cap assumes pipeline is reliable. Risk assessment: with on-hand=0 and large in-transit that may be lost, following the OR cap=27 risks stockout given ~112 units/week demand. Decision rule: because suspected lost/delayed pipeline is present (and we have no confirmed arrivals yet), order enough to cover one typical week of demand to reduce immediate stockout risk while avoiding heavy holdings if the pipeline actually arrives. Action quantity: order 112 units (\u2248 one-week mean demand). This is a conservative override of OR's 27 to prioritize fulfilling imminent demand while we wait for concluded arrival evidence to update lead-time belief.

  "rationale": "Lead-time: Concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals labeled lead_time=4). Inventory: on-hand=237, in-transit=0 so pipeline_inventory=237. Demand outlook: recent sustained regime shifts reduced single-period demand to ~4 units (Periods 29\u201345 average \u22484.1), a large, sustained decline vs. historical. OR used promised L=4 and long-run historical demand to recommend 175, but that would greatly overstock given current low demand. Coverage calculation: at ~4 units/period, current on-hand covers ~59 periods (237 / 4 \u2248 59), so no replenishment is required for the foreseeable horizon; each extra unit incurs $1 holding cost while profit per sale is $19 but sales are very infrequent. Risk: supplier lead time is 4 and orders can be lost, so placing an order is not necessary and only increases holding cost exposure.
