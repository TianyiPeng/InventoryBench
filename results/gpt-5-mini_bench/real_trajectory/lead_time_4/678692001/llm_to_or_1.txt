Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (weekly data through early Feb). Historical weekly demand samples (270,196,180,187,137) show no clear recent regime shift but average demand is moderate. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover the current period plus lead time. I use the promised lead time (default) because no concluded arrivals exist to infer an alternate lead time. I select default demand and volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which yields a base-stock that balances service (profit >> holding cost) while keeping holding cost modest.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). On-hand=0, in-transit=274 (order placed P1) and P1 conclude shows arrived=0 so no concluded arrivals yet; cannot infer actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks, mean=194) cover Jan\u2013Feb. Promised lead time will be used (default) because there is no confirmed lead-time change. I select default demand estimators so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This balances service level (uses full sample mean) while avoiding overfitting to one missed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan 2019) show mean ~194 units/week. Two recent orders (274 + 279 = 553) remain in-transit and have not concluded; no concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred. Use promised lead time to avoid premature lead-time revision. Set L to default (promised=4). Use default demand sizing: mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to reflect the 5-period coverage and limited evidence of a regime shift. Use default sigma_hat to reflect historical variability across all samples. This balances service level (cover upcoming 5 periods) against holding cost given current in-transit stock.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Demand history (weekly samples from Jan\u2013Feb) mean=194, std computed from samples. No concluded arrivals in Periods 1\u20133; in-transit=821 equals sum of ordered quantities (274+279+268), indicating shipments delayed beyond promised LT. To be conservative I set L explicit=6 to cover extended transit risk. Use mu_hat default to scale (1+L) by the full-sample mean (lets backend compute exact value with chosen L). Use sigma_hat default so backend scales sample std by sqrt(1+L). These choices increase on-hand protection against stockouts given observed multi-period delivery delays while relying on historical demand samples.

Carry-over insight: Orders from Periods 1\u20133 (total 821 units) have not concluded; in-transit=821 equals ordered sum \u2192 sustained shipment delay; actual lead time appears > promised (evidence: 3 consecutive periods with arrived=0).

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Demand samples (historic weeks in Jan) show mean ~194/week. There is clear sustained shipment delay: orders from Periods 1\u20134 (274+279+268+259=1080) have not concluded and in-transit=1080, indicating actual lead time exceeds the promised 4 periods. To protect service level against continued delays, I set L explicitly longer than promised. I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend scales demand over (1+L) using all historical samples; this balances higher safety stock (due to longer L) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Carry-over insight: Confirmed sustained shipment delay: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (total 1080 units) have not arrived after promised 4-period lead time (3+ consecutive conclude messages with arrived=0); actual lead time > promised 4 periods.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2566.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18). Recent conclude (Period 5) shows arrival=274 (ordered P1) => observed lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=132, in-transit=1057 (includes outstanding orders). Historical weekly demand samples (270,196,180,187,137) mean=194. Promised lead time=4; concluded evidence supports using observed lead-time estimate. I choose L='calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (confirming 4). Demand forecast uses 'default' so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) to capture review+lead demand with the full sample mean; sigma_hat='default' to scale sample volatility by sqrt(1+L). This balances service (high profit/low holding cost ratio) with holding cost by using full-sample estimates and confirmed lead time rather than shorter recent windows with limited data.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period5, lead_time=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). Recent concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period5: P1\u2192P5, Period6: P2\u2192P6). On-hand=283, in-transit=778 (total pipeline=1061) versus historical weekly mean=194 (5-period review+lead demand = 970). I set L using observed lead times to reflect confirmed L=4 (use calculate). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine uses the full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L) to produce a base-stock consistent with historical demand and the confirmed lead time; this balances service level (profit/holding cost ratio) against holding costs given ample pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Recent concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (Period1\u2192Period5, Period2\u2192Period6, Period3\u2192Period7). On-hand=406, in-transit=510 (pipeline present). Historical weekly samples (5 weeks) show mean demand ~194/week; no sustained demand regime shift detected. Use promised/default lead time so backend uses L=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, yielding a base-stock that balances profit vs holding cost given stable demand and confirmed lead time. This keeps orders conservative while existing pipeline and on-hand cover near-term demand and avoids overstock given holding cost.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Demand recent weeks stable and elevated: last 5 demands = [136,142,128,145,148], mean=139.8/week. On-hand=517, in-transit=280 (recent shipments arriving on promised 4-period cadence confirmed in history). Carry-over evidence shows actual lead time = 4. Use L=default to match confirmed promised lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to capture the recent demand regime: (1+L)*mean_recent = 5*139.8 \u2248 699 planned coverage over review+lead. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent demand volatility. These choices prioritize meeting service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding excess stock by using recent regime stats.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weekly demand has averaged moderate volumes (recent demands: 142,128,145,148,80) with no sustained regime shift. On-hand=688, in-transit=29; no overdue shipments visible. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (Period1\u20135 arrivals), so use calculated lead time to reflect observed behavior. Choose L=calculate to lock in observed lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history, balancing service level (profit/holding ratio) against holding cost.

Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). On-hand=628, in-transit=230. Historical conclude messages (Periods 5\u20139) consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4; evidence supports actual lead time = 4. Pipeline + on-hand currently adequate vs. recent demand. Set L to 'calculate' to let backend average observed lead times (captures confirmed LT=4). Use 'default' for mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples respectively, anchoring forecast to historical sample mean/variance while accounting for the inferred lead time and balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period=2019-04-29 (Period 12). Recent demand since arrivals resumed (Periods 5\u201311) averages materially above the early Jan samples and shows a sustained new regime (7 consecutive periods: 142,128,145,148,80,60,71). On-hand=557 + in-transit=273 = 830 units available; promised lead time=4 periods matches observed lead_time=4 in history, so keep promised LT. To capture the newer higher-demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat (last 7 periods) so the OR backend sets base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under current demand. I keep default sigma to leverage full-sample volatility and avoid overfitting; this balances service level (profit $19 vs holding $1) while avoiding excessive holding given already-large on-hand + pipeline and confirmed LT.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent weekly demand samples (historical mean \u2248194 units/week) and concluded arrivals show actual lead time = 4. On-hand=503, in-transit=244 (sufficient short-term cover but pipeline must be treated with L=4). I set L via calculate to lock in the empirically observed lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use default (backend will apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples). This keeps the base-stock tied to long-run sample mean (captures typical demand \u2248194/week \xd7 (1+4)=~970) while using observed lead time so orders cover the full review+lead horizon, balancing service vs. holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (evidence: Period1 order arrived in Period5, Period2\u2192P6, Period3\u2192P7, Period4\u2192P8, Period5\u2192P9).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=407, in-transit=364. Historical concludes consistently show lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 observations), so set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 4). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend uses (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std of all historical samples (captures baseline weekly demand scaled for review+lead period). This balances service (high profit $19 vs holding $1) by sizing base stock from full-sample demand with confirmed L=4, avoiding ad-hoc reductions while shipments have stabilized.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=484, in-transit=282. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (confirmed P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). No recent sustained demand regime change in the provided samples (Jan 2019 weekly samples mean=194). To be conservative and aligned with confirmed lead time, I use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock using (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This leverages the established lead-time evidence while avoiding overreacting to short-term ordering variability; it keeps service level driven by historical mean demand across the review+lead period and uses default volatility for safety against stockouts given current in-transit units.

History shows consistent 4-period actual lead time (orders from P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use calculated lead time representation and default demand estimates to let the OR engine compute base-stock with (1+L) coverage. Chosen methods are robust to past delayed arrivals while relying on confirmed L=4 evidence; default mu/sigma use all samples ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to balance service vs holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple concluded messages: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.). On-hand=412, in-transit=294; pipeline plus on-hand (706) comfortably covers expected near-term demand. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (average of observed lead times = 4). For demand forecast I use the default aggregated method: mu_hat='default' (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all historical samples = 5\xd7194 = 970), and sigma_hat='default' so backend uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. These choices rely on the stable observed lead time and the historical weekly sample set; they provide a base-stock that balances the high profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1) while accounting for 5-period demand uncertainty.

Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; on-hand=403, in-transit=312. Using promised/default lead time keeps OR engine aligned with observed lead time. Demand history samples (five weekly values: 270,196,180,187,137) are limited; I choose default demand/volatility aggregation so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the full sample set, providing a stable baseline (covers review+lead period =5 weeks) and avoids overfitting to short-term noise. This balances service level (profit/higher fill) vs holding cost by using the backend's capped ordering logic with these aggregate statistics.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=449 + in-transit=301 = 750 units \u2014 ample cover vs. long-run high mean from Jan samples. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concludes; I'll use observed-average for L. To avoid over-ordering from high Jan means, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect the most recent lower-demand regime and reduce target base-stock, and sigma_hat recent_N to reflect recent volatility. This reduces excess holding while maintaining service given confirmed L=4.

Use promised/default lead time and default demand aggregations so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, producing a base-stock that balances profit ($19) vs holding ($1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=592, in-transit=135; recent demand has fallen vs. earlier samples (last 5 concluded demands \u2248 [71,42,25,36,29], mean \u2248 40.6). Historical conclude messages consistently show 4-period actual lead time. To reflect confirmed lead-time evidence use calculated lead time from observations, and to avoid overstating demand use a recent-N forecast capturing the low recent regime (N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes orders to current lower demand while preserving service against lead-time risk.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=652, in-transit=72. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ... P22\u2192P26). Demand sample seed (Jan\u2013Feb) mean=194 units/week; (1+L)=5 multiplies this for review+lead demand. Given confirmed LT=4, set L by calculating observed lead times to lock onto reality. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this yields a conservative high service stocking appropriate given profit/holding (profit $19 vs holding $1 implies high target fill rate).

On-hand=634, in-transit=75; pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers demand given historical weekly mean (~194) so no emergency ordering. I set L to default (use promised lead time=4).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02): recent realized demand has fallen to low teens per week versus earlier ~80-140. On-hand=659, in-transit=41 -> ample coverage (~>30 weeks at recent rates). Observed actual lead time consistently 4 periods in concluded history. To avoid excess holding cost, set L based on observed lead times and forecast demand using recent demand samples (short-term regime). Chosen methods: L=calculate (use observed avg LT=4); mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base (1+L)\xd7mean on the latest short-run demand; sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent low volatility. This reduces target base-stock to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and limits new ordering given high on-hand inventory.

Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps forecasting conservative given stable history and avoids overreacting to short fluctuations, while letting the OR engine balance service level vs holding cost.

Recent demand in-game has trended well below the early-sample mean, but no clear 3+ period regime shift requiring an explicit recent_N or EWMA adjustment. To keep the OR engine aligned with promised/observed lead time and the full-sample demand statistics, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples.

On-hand=685, in-transit=0 \u2014 no overdue shipments currently. Actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so using the promised/default lead time is appropriate. I select default methods so backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean and std: L=default (promised 4), mu_hat=default ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) to anchor to historical demand, and sigma_hat=default (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples).

Recent demand has been very low (weeks 29\u201335: single-digit to low double-digit sales), so current on-hand is ample and there's no overdue pipeline. To let the OR engine compute a balanced base stock using full-sample demand statistics and the promised lead time, I select default methods for L, mu_hat, and sigma_hat so backend uses promised lead time and full-sample mean/variance. This avoids over-ordering given already-high on-hand and low recent demand while preserving service-level calculations.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-21. On-hand=676, in-transit=0. Recent weekly demand has fallen and stabilized at a low level (Periods 29\u201336 demand sequence: 9,6,2,2,5,3,0,6 \u2192 mean \u2248 4.6). Promised lead time is 4; concluded arrivals historically confirm actual lead time = 4. To avoid overstocking given high on-hand and low recent demand, keep promised lead time (default) and use recent demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat. I choose recent_N with N=8 to capture the most recent low-demand regime (Periods 29\u201336) so the OR engine reduces replenishment targets and limits holding cost while preserving service. Sigma uses recent_N N=8 to reflect reduced variability.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/28 (Period 38). On-hand=675, in-transit=0. Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods (consistent arrivals P1->P5,...). Recent demand has shifted sharply down since Period 29: last 9 periods (P29\u2013P37) demands = [9,6,2,2,5,3,0,6,1], mean \u2248 3.78 units/week (stable low regime, regime length=9). To avoid overstock while preserving service, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime using recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend reduces target base-stock and caps ordering volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent weekly demand has fallen to single digits (last ~20 periods mostly 0\u20139/week) versus historical samples (mean=194/week from Jan samples). On-hand=669, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock vs current demand. Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods, so use the promised/default lead time. To avoid excess holding cost, use default demand estimates (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from samples) and refrain from increasing replenishment aggressiveness.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Recent realized demand has fallen sharply and persistently since ~Period 29 (periods 29\u201339 average demand \u22483.82 units/week vs. historical sample mean \u2248194). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default L. To avoid large overstock and high holding cost given the sustained low-demand regime, forecast demand using the recent regime: set mu_hat from the last 11 periods (Periods 29\u201339) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Use sigma_hat based on the same recent 11-sample window to capture current low volatility. No new shipment-loss insight to add.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-607.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=664, in-transit=0. Historical long-run samples show much higher demand (mean=194) but there is a clear, sustained drop in demand starting Period 29: Periods 29\u201340 demand avg=3.75 over 12 weeks. Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 in the conclude history. To avoid excess inventory and reflect the low recent sales, set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=12 to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the recent low-demand regime (N chosen = 12 = regime length). This reduces target base-stock to match current low demand and limits over-ordering while preserving service given low holding cost relative to profit.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 29: avg decreased from 194 (historical sample mean) to 3.75 (Periods 29\u201340 avg, 12 periods) \u2014 sustained low-demand regime (-98%).

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=662, in-transit=0. Historical data show a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 29: recent weekly demand is very low (Periods 29\u201341 average \u22483.8 units/week) versus historical mean ~194. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. To avoid overstocking, use recent demand estimate over the low-demand regime: set L to promised (default = 4), and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to reflect the low mean/variance from the most recent 13 periods (Periods 29\u201341). This reduces forecasted (1+L) demand and tightens order quantities to balance service level and holding cost given large on-hand stock and sustained low demand.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Period 29 (avg \u22483.75/week) and multiple concludes confirming actual lead time = 4. On-hand=658, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample stock vs very low demand. Set L using observed lead times to match confirmed behavior. Use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the sustained low-demand regime (Periods 29\u201340+ recent), avoiding overweighting old high-demand data. This keeps target base-stock small and minimizes holding cost while preserving service given confirmed low demand.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 29 (weekly avg ~3.75) vs historical mean ~194; on-hand=657, in-transit=0 and no outstanding arrivals expected. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised lead time. To avoid overstocking given very low sustained demand, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=12) to reflect the low-demand regime (use the last 12 periods since the detected changepoint). This reduces target base-stock and caps replenishment volatility, balancing service level with holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:

Given high on-hand (654) and zero in-transit, use promised/default lead time to align with observed confirmations, and use recent demand regime for forecasting. Set L=default to keep OR engine using promised 4-period lead time; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=16 (regime length from Period 29\u201344) so the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility reflect the sustained low-demand regime and avoid overordering and holding cost accumulation.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23). Recent demand regime is the sustained low-demand state since Period 29 (avg \u22483.75/week). On-hand=653, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample inventory relative to current demand, so order rates should reflect the low-demand regime to avoid holding cost. Actual lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; therefore use promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N using the most recent regime (Periods 29\u201345, length 17) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the current low-demand samples, which reduces order targets and holding cost while maintaining service.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Historical full-sample mean ~194 (early 2019) but a sustained low-demand regime began at Period 29 (Periods 29\u201346 avg \u22483.75). On-hand=652, in-transit=0; ample on-hand vs very low recent demand so ordering should reflect the new low-demand regime. Use promised/default lead time (4) since concluded history repeatedly confirms 4-period actual lead time. Set demand forecast using recent_N over the recent low-demand regime (Periods 29\u201346) to avoid inflating orders from early high-demand samples; apply same recent_N window for volatility.
