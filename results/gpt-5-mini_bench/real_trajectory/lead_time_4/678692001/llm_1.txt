Supplier promised lead time = 4 periods; no in-transit or on-hand inventory. With the lead-time and execution rules, we must cover L+1 = 5 future demand periods when ordering now. Using a conservative forecast reflecting recent decline, I assume ~180 units/week (rounded below from the 5-week avg of 194 but biased down toward recent weeks). Required coverage = 5 * 180 = 900 units. No overdue or in-transit shipments to account for. Holding cost is low relative to profit (Holding $1 vs Profit $19), so prioritizing service and avoiding stockouts is appropriate given long lead time.

  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (post-Christmas, winter) \u2014 category (women's lightweight sports vest) is out-of-season, no expected holiday uplift. Demand regime: recent history (P31\u2013P46) shows sustained low weekly demand (mostly 0\u20136 units/week, recent P42\u2013P46 = 4,1,1,1), so forecast remains very low (~1\u20134/week). Lead time/pipeline: supplier lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; no in-transit stock. Inventory: on-hand=252 units, carrying cost $1/unit/period is large relative to expected sales (profit $19). Risk: ordering risks extra holding cost without sales. Order decision: place no new order to avoid additional holding cost and allow on-hand to deplete toward demand. ",
