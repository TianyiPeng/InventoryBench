Decision: follow OR and order 56 units. Reasoning: recent demand is stable with no calendar/seasonal signal; high profit vs low holding cost justifies OR's high service target; no evidence of lead-time change or lost shipments to contradict OR. Ordering 56 respects the cap and replenishment cadence given L=4; given current on-hand=0 we cannot avoid immediate period stockouts, but ordering more than the OR cap would violate the capped policy rationale and risk excess inventory if demand reverts.

For review+lead (1+L)=5 periods: \u03bc\u0302 = 5 \xd7 45.8 = 229 units.
