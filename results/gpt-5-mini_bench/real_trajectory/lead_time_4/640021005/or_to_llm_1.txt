Promised lead time 4 means an order placed now must cover this period plus the next 4 periods (L+1=5) because arrivals occur after decision. With no on-hand or pipeline, ordering only OR's capped quantity (~25) risks heavy stockouts vs. expected 62 units needed over the lead+review horizon. Profit per unit ($4) substantially exceeds per-period holding cost ($1), and demand history shows elevated recent weeks (14,18,20). Therefore I override OR and order to cover the expected 5-period mean demand (62 units). This balances expected sales capture (earning $4/unit) against holding cost exposure; given lack of pipeline and multi-period coverage requirement, meeting expected demand is higher-return than the OR's single-period-cap-limited recommendation. No concluded arrivals or lead-time deviations observed, so no carry-over insight recorded.",
