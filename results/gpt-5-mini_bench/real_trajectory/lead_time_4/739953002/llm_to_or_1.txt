Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent demand shows an upward regime vs earlier zeros (samples: 0,0,14,47,29). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so we must cover current + L periods. Use promised lead time (default L=4). For mu_hat, use recent_N with N=3 (last three samples 14,47,29) to capture the recent higher demand trend; backend will compute (1+L)*mean. Use default sigma_hat so backend uses overall sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher service need from rising demand while relying on full-sample volatility for safety given limited data.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=112 (orders from P1=64, P2=48) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet, so actual lead time is unobserved and not overdue given promised L=4. Historical demand samples (5 weeks): [0,0,14,47,29], mean=18. I use default lead time (promised L=4) because concluded messages do not show any arrivals yet. I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable forecast (mu_hat\u224890) and volatility (sigma_hat\u224840) while the pipeline of 112 units covers upcoming periods. This balances service level vs. holding cost without overreacting to unconfirmed lead-time changes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=124 (orders P1=64,P2=48,P3=12). No concluded arrivals yet \u2014 pipeline exists but shipments are overdue. Use promised lead time (default) since no concluded arrival to reliably infer actual lead time. Demand appears to have a recent regime (last 3 periods: 16,23,12) so set mu_hat based on recent_N to capture current demand (N=3). Keep sigma_hat as default (uses all samples) to avoid overfitting volatility with limited data. These choices ensure the OR backend targets service for the short recent demand pattern while relying on default volatility and promised lead time given missing arrival confirmations.

Carry-over insight: Multiple shipments overdue: orders placed Period1=64, Period2=48, Period3=12 have not concluded by Period4 (no arrivals reported) \u2014 suggests lead time is longer than promised or shipments may be lost.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Recent weekly demand has been: historical samples [0,0,14,47,29] and observed Period1-4 demands = [16,23,12,42] \u2014 no clear sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=124 (this reflects orders placed in Periods 1\u20133); promised lead time=4 \u2014 remember arrivals placed in P1\u2013P3 will conclude later (expected arrival during P5 and visible in P6). Because there is no confirmed lead-time deviation in concluded messages and demand shows no sustained shift, use default (promised) lead time and population-wide demand statistics so the OR backend uses the full sample mean/variance across the (1+L) review+lead horizon to set base stock. This balances service level (covering weeks of observed demand) versus holding cost given modest unit profit/holding ratio.

Daily Reward (R_t): $161.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18 (Period 6). Recent history: Period5 conclude shows the Period1 order (64) arrived with lead_time=4, confirming promised lead time. Current inventory: on-hand=19, in-transit=70 \u2192 total pipeline=89. Historical weekly demand samples: [0,0,14,47,29] (mean=18). With confirmed L=4, (1+L)=5 \u2192 target demand over review+lead \u22485\xd7mean. I choose L='calculate' to use observed lead times (only observed =4). For demand parameters I use defaults so the OR backend computes mu_hat=(1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sigma_hat=sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service level (covering ~5 weeks of expected demand) with holding cost; current pipeline (~89) is roughly equal to (1+L)\xd7mean (~90), so no aggressive uplift is needed now.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period1 order arrived in Period5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25 (Period 7). Recent concluded periods confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1->P5, P2->P6). On-hand=23, in-transit=74; recent demand has shifted higher starting Period4 (demands: P4=42, P5=45, P6=44). To capture this new higher-demand regime, set L by averaging observed lead times and base demand on the last 3 demand periods (the detected regime). Use recent_N (N=3) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock targets and safety stock reflect the elevated, recent demand while sigma_hat captures recent volatility. This balances service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 for orders placed in Periods 1-3 (arrived Periods 5-7). On-hand=0, in-transit=109 (pipeline present). Demand has stepped up in recent weeks (Periods 5-7: 45,44,56). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I target the recent high-demand regime: use recent_N with N=3 (Periods 5-7) so the backend forecasts (1+L)*mean of recent 3 and volatility from recent 3 to raise service while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1 and profit=$4 (q=0.8 implies high service level).

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7); Recent demand regime (Periods 5-7) avg=48.33 units/week vs prior avg (~23), sustained for 3 periods.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent demand jumped starting Period 5: Periods 5-8 demands = [45,44,56,81], recent regime (Periods 5-8) avg=56.5 vs prior avg ~23 (Periods 1-4). On-hand=0, in-transit=169 units (sufficient short-term cover but arrivals are delayed one period in visibility). Lead time has been empirically confirmed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). I therefore set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed behavior. For demand I focus on the recent higher regime: use recent_N over the last 4 demand samples (N=4) to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the elevated demand while limiting excess holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Observed actual lead time consistently 4 periods (multiple concluded orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P5\u2192P9). On-hand=0, in-transit=244 (pipeline bulky). Recent sustained demand regime detected in Periods 5-7 (avg\u224848.3 units/week) and persists in subsequent high demands. To align the OR base-stock with the confirmed lead time and recent higher demand, set L method to calculate (uses observed lead times). Use recent_N=3 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor forecasts to the most recent regime (Periods 5-7) so the backend upsizes base_stock for the higher-demand regime while reflecting recent volatility.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Observed lead times repeatedly confirmed at 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7 and subsequent P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10), so use calculated lead time. Recent sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 5: use recent window covering Periods 5\u201310 (N=6) where average demand is higher than the pre-shift series (captures weeks with demands 45,44,56,81,41,40). On-hand=12 + in-transit=283 gives large pipeline; parameters chosen to let OR compute base-stock and cap while reflecting elevated recent demand and observed lead time, protecting service level during this sustained higher-demand regime and avoiding understock given many in-transit units and past shipment delays.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has shifted up and stabilized since Periods 5-11 (recent avg \u224847.86 units/week). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in multiple conclude messages. Current on-hand=31 and in-transit=236 \u2192 pipeline total=267 which covers (1+L)*recent_mean =5*47.86\u2248239, so inventory is adequate but demand remains elevated. I set L to default (promised lead time = 4, consistent with observed concludes). I use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u201311) so the OR engine sizes base stock to meet the new regime while accounting for pipeline; sigma_hat recent_N mirrors demand volatility over the same window.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple concluded P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). Recent demand shows a downshift since the high regime in Periods 5-7 (48.3 avg); the most recent 3 concluded weeks (Periods 10-12) demands = [40, 28, 43], mean = 37.0, suggesting a lower current demand regime. On-hand=48 and in-transit=180 provide ample pipeline cover; using a short recent_N=3 estimate for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the latest regime while L stays at the confirmed promised value. This reduces overstock risk while preserving service given large in-transit quantity.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). Historical concludes show a stable actual lead time = 4 (multiple P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, etc.). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 (Periods 5-7 avg ~48.33) and has persisted; I therefore bias forecasts to recent regime. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed =4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the elevated demand regime since Period 5; choose N=9 (Periods 5\u201313) to cover the sustained higher-demand window while keeping N between 3 and 20. This increases base_stock to meet higher demand while sigma_hat recent_N captures current variability, balancing service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=83, in-transit=78. Historical concludes show consistent 4-period actual lead time across many orders; demand has shifted up since Period 5. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 (Periods 5\u201315) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (avg\u224847.18 over P5\u2013P15 vs \u224823.25 before). Sigma uses recent_N N=11 to reflect recent volatility. These choices focus the base stock on the new higher mean while accounting for recent variability and confirmed lead time, reducing stockouts while controlling holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P5\u2192P9, P6\u2192P10, P7\u2192P11, P8\u2192P12, P9\u2192P13, P10\u2192P14); Demand regime shift starting Period 5: avg increased from ~23.25 (P1\u2013P4) to ~47.18 (P5\u2013P15), sustained for 11 periods (+102%).

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime starting Period 5 with higher weekly demand (P5\u2013P16 average \u224847). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods. Current inventory: on-hand=43, in-transit=144 (covers several weeks). To reflect the confirmed LT=4 and the sustained higher-demand regime, use promised lead time (default) and compute demand estimates from the recent post-changepoint window. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=12) to capture the sustained higher mean/variance from Periods 5\u201316, which balances service level (captures elevated demand) against holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 5: recent-period (P5\u2013P15) avg demand \u224847.18 units/week. Current on-hand=16, in-transit=212 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=228 vs (1+L)*mean \u22485*47.18=235.9, a small shortfall; therefore use L=promised (confirmed 4) and set demand estimates from the recent high-demand regime to avoid understock. Chosen methods: L default to keep promised lead time (confirmed by concludes); mu_hat recent_N to capture the elevated recent mean (N=11 covers P5\u2013P15); sigma_hat recent_N to capture recent volatility over the same regime (N=11). These parameters steer the OR backend toward a higher base-stock to balance lost sales (high profit) versus holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent sustained demand regime (Periods 5\u201315) averaged \u224847.18 units/week (confirmed in history); confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=44, in-transit=169 => pipeline+on-hand=213 which is slightly below the (1+L)-period demand need. Set L by calculating observed lead times (all observed =4) to reflect confirmed reality. Set mu_hat explicitly to cover (1+L)\xd7forecast using the recent regime mean: (1+4)*47.18 = 235.9 units. Keep sigma_hat default to let backend use historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This raises target base-stock to meet higher sustained demand while letting OR backend cap orders to control holding costs.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Recent history strongly confirms actual lead time = 4 and a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 5 (P5\u2013P19 recent avg ~47 units/week). Current inventory: on-hand=17, in-transit=225 -> pipeline=242, which roughly covers (1+L)=5 periods of recent demand (~235). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will yield 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=15 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u201319). For sigma I also use recent_N N=15 to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. These choices align the base-stock calculation to the elevated demand while avoiding dilution from the low pre-regime samples, and they rely on confirmed lead-time evidence so the OR engine orders enough to maintain service without excessive holding cost.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 21 (2019-07-01). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently observed as 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (higher demand). Current inventory: on-hand=65, in-transit=159 (pipeline large). I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4) since observed lead time matches promised and OR backend expects promised L. For demand I use a recent_N estimate to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the last 16 periods since the changepoint at Period 5) so mu_hat reflects the elevated mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=16) to capture recent demand volatility. These parameters bias the base-stock upward to support the higher service level from the new regime while relying on current large pipeline to avoid excessive ordering.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). Observed lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded history (multiple confirmed P\u2192P+4 arrivals). On-hand=108, in-transit=107 \u2192 healthy pipeline but maintain elevated demand coverage. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 and sustained through later periods (recent average ~47 units/week). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to confirm 4, and use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 11 demand samples to forecast (1+L) period demand and volatility). This balances service (avoid stockouts under higher mean) against holding cost by basing targets on the confirmed higher-demand regime.

Period 23 (2019/7/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P\u2192P+4 confirmations). Recent sustained demand regime since Period 5: avg demand up ~+102% vs P1\u2013P4, lasting >3 periods. On-hand=103 + in-transit=79 = 182 units. With promised/observed L=4, review+lead horizon = 5 periods; pipeline (182) currently covers several weeks but we must keep safety for variability. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm as 4). For demand I use a recent_N estimate over the sustained higher-demand regime (N=18 periods: Periods 5\u201322) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 18 samples, capturing the elevated demand level. For sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=18 to reflect volatility in the same regime. These choices align OR base-stock toward the confirmed higher-demand regime while using observed lead time to avoid understocking given prior lost/delayed shipments.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. On-hand=120, in-transit=71 so pipeline covers upcoming demand but demand regime shifted up starting Period 5 and has been sustained. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. For demand (mu_hat) I use recent_N over the sustained higher-demand regime (N=19) to capture the elevated mean across the (post-shift) periods; this yields a (1+L)-scaled forecast that matches the new regime. For volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=19 to align safety stock sizing with recent variability. These choices keep service high for the sustained higher-demand regime while avoiding excess holding by using recent-regime statistics.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Historical concludes repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained higher demand regime since Period 5 (~47 units/week vs ~23 prior). Current on-hand=100, in-transit=108 so pipeline + on-hand comfortable vs recent demand. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 4, consistent with observed confirmations). I choose mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all historical demand samples, leveraging the confirmed longer-run demand regime and letting the optimizer balance service level vs holding cost given profit/holding parameters.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained higher-demand regime starting Period 5 (mean ~47 units/week). On-hand=75, in-transit=92; pipeline plus on-hand covers several weeks but we must keep safety stock for elevated demand. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed = 4). For demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last ~20 periods of demand to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std), which raises base_stock appropriately to balance service level (profit/holding tradeoff) against holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime uplift starting Period 5 (avg ~47 units/week through P15 and thereafter higher than early periods). Current on-hand=14, in-transit=152 (pipeline strong). To match confirmed LT and recent higher demand, keep lead time default (promised=4) and estimate demand from the recent high-demand regime. Use recent_N=11 to capture the sustained elevated regime (~P5\u2013P15 length) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR base-stock accounts for higher mean and volatility while the backend cap still limits extreme orders. This balances service (avoid stockouts given strong pipeline) against holding cost.

On-hand=0, in-transit=136 (will cover some upcoming demand but arrivals are observed with 1-period visibility). Lead time has been consistently 4 in concluded history; use promised/default L to match observed evidence. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use up to 20 most recent periods of demand to estimate (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility), balancing service level against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5: avg demand ~47.18 (P5\u2013P15) and continued higher volumes since, with many confirmed 4-period lead-time observations. Current stock: on-hand=2, in-transit=176 (total pipeline 178) which already covers several weeks. I set L to default (promised=4) because concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use the most recent 11 demand samples reflecting the post-changepoint mean) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=11 to capture recent volatility. These choices focus the base-stock on the confirmed higher-demand regime while using the confirmed lead time to avoid underordering; keeping N=11 balances responsiveness to the regime shift with sample stability given 11+ consecutive high-demand periods.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 30 (2019-09-02). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 with higher mean through Period 29. On-hand=0, in-transit=265 (pipeline large). Set L explicitly to 4 to reflect confirmed actual lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N with N=20 to capture the elevated recent-demand regime (use the last 20 concluded-week samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean over the current regime). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=20 to capture recent demand volatility. These settings align the base-stock target to the higher sustained demand while using recent volatility to size safety stock; explicit L avoids under-ordering due to earlier lost/delayed shipments.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (carry-over: sustained avg \u224847.18 from P5\u2013P15 and continued high demand thereafter). On-hand=0, in-transit=205 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals occur after decision. Observed lead time repeatedly confirmed at 4 periods in concluded history. I set L via calculate to let backend use observed lead-times. For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use last 11 demand samples to form (1+L)\xd7mean), and use recent_N N=11 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward the higher recent demand while respecting pipeline to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Demand has shown a sustained higher regime since Period 5 (confirmed +102% increase sustained through Period 31). On-hand=0, in-transit=260. Historical concluded lead times repeatedly equal 4 periods (many P\u2192P+4 arrivals). I set L to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time history (average observed = 4). To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 (regime length >20, cap 20) so the OR backend forecasts using the most recent 20 demand samples (scaled by 1+L). This balances service (higher mean demand) against holding cost given ample pipeline (260 units) and prevents under-ordering from ignoring the sustained uplift.

Use promised/default L=4 to match confirmed lead time and OR assumptions. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (large sample from recent high-demand periods) so the backend's base-stock will target service while controlling holding cost.

Historical conclues consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 5 (higher mean sustained many periods). I set L to default (promised=4) because actual lead time has been consistently observed as 4 and matches promise. For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (changepoint at Period 5; recent regime length >>20 so N=20 per rules). Sigma uses recent_N N=20 to reflect volatility in the recent high-demand regime. These choices keep base-stock responsive to the elevated demand while using pipeline inventory to avoid over-ordering given holding cost.

Demand regime elevated since Period 5 (sustained higher weekly demand); recent demand is the best predictor. I set L by 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (will be 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (use most recent 20 demand samples to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This balances service (higher safety stock for elevated demand) against holding cost while accounting for the 4-period pipeline and the large in-transit volume.

LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (sustained); current on-hand=33, in-transit=236 which provides coverage vs (1+L) demand. I set L to be calculated from observed lead-times (will be 4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the prolonged higher-demand regime while smoothing older low-demand periods. I apply recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep base_stock aligned to the sustained higher demand while using observed lead time and recent variability to balance service level vs holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 5 (higher mean sustained many periods). On-hand=33, in-transit=262 provides substantial pipeline. I therefore keep L as default (promised=4). For demand I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the long, higher-demand regime (use max cap 20 to reflect the sustained higher mean since Period 5). I apply recent_N for sigma_hat (N=20) to reflect recent volatility under the new regime. These choices bias the OR base-stock toward the higher, sustained demand while using recent volatility to balance service level vs holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). Demand regime increased starting Period 5 and has persisted (Periods 5\u201338 show higher demand vs P1\u2013P4). To reflect confirmed lead time and sustained higher demand, set L by calculating observed lead times. Use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the sustained, higher-demand regime (cap N at 20 to weight recent sustained behavior while smoothing noise). This balances service (avoid stockouts given strong ongoing demand and 194 units in-transit) vs holding cost by letting the OR backend compute base stock from these inputs.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Observed lead time has been consistently 4 periods across many concluded orders\u2014use promised/default L to match the environment. Demand has a sustained higher regime since Period 5 (documented in history); to capture the elevated recent mean and volatility I use recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat (captures the most recent demand behavior while smoothing noise). This increases base_stock to protect service level given high observed demand and long lead time, while sigma_hat recent_N informs safety stock.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (many P\u2192P+4 confirmations). Recent sustained demand regime from Periods 5\u201315 (avg \u224847.2/week) persists through later history. Current inventory: on-hand=85, in-transit=187 (pipeline sufficient for near term). I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (matches confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N with N=11 to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 5\u201315 average \u224847.2) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7recent mean. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=11 to capture volatility in that same regime. These choices bias orders toward the higher, sustained demand while relying on observed lead time to avoid underordering given past delays.

Demand shifted up starting Period 5 and has remained at a higher level with volatile spikes (notably Period 42 demand=315). On-hand=0, in-transit=337 units (pipeline large). To reflect the confirmed lead time I use calculated lead time. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime while weighting recent volatility, I forecast using the last 15 demand samples (recent_N N=15) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std; this balances service level against holding cost given a large in-transit position.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 5 (confirmed previously: avg ~47 vs prior ~23), with several large spikes recently (P42=315, P43=144). Observed lead time repeatedly confirmed at 4 periods. Current on-hand=30 and in-transit=481 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple weeks. I keep L at promised/default (4) because observed lead time equals promised and is stable. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=20 (captures the most recent sustained regime while capping at 20). Same recent_N=20 for sigma to reflect current volatility including recent spikes. These choices bias the base-stock upward to meet the higher sustained demand while the large pipeline reduces immediate stockout risk and avoids over-ordering beyond the cap logic.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 46 (2019-12-23): on-hand=0, in-transit=484. Historical concluded lead times consistently equal 4 periods; use promised/default lead time. Recent demand is elevated and volatile (multiple very high weeks in Periods 42-45 and sustained higher mean since Period 5), so use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime and recent spike behavior. Select recent_N with N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the (1+L)-period demand estimate and volatility on the latest regime while avoiding overfitting to a single extreme week. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost by limiting the window to recent observations.

Period 47 (2019-12-30). On-hand=29, in-transit=566 \u2014 large pipeline. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; demand has been elevated and volatile (recent huge spikes in P42\u2013P45). To reflect confirmed actual lead time and recent higher-demand regime while keeping variance estimation broad, I set L by calculating average observed lead times, mu_hat using a recent_N window to capture the elevated recent mean, and sigma_hat as default to let the OR engine use full-sample volatility. This balances service level (avoid stockouts given large in-transit and recent demand spikes) against holding costs by relying on recent demand mean but conservative volatility.
