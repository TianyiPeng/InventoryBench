{
  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed = 4 periods from carry-over (evidence: Period1\u2192Period5 etc.). Inventory: on-hand=0, in-transit=486 (undelivered units visible). Recent demand has been highly volatile with multiple large spikes (Periods 42\u201346: 315,144,29,196,71), so short-run demand is elevated but unpredictable. Requirement: order + on-hand + in-transit should cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because orders placed now arrive after 4 periods and current period demand still occurs after decision. Conservatively estimate 5-period demand using recent weeks: average of Periods 42\u201346 = (315+144+29+196+71)/5 = 151 units; 5-period total \u2248 755. However in-transit=486 already covers a large fraction of that exposure; OR recommended 0. Placing new orders now risks large holding costs ($1/unit/period) because many units are already inbound and lead time is long. Given substantial pipeline (486), high holding cost relative to profit ($1 vs $4 per unit per period), and OR baseline=0, I will not order this period to avoid overstock and waiting to observe which in-transit shipments actually conclude (some past orders were delayed/lost). Monitor concluded arrivals next periods and revisit if in-transit proves insufficient. Final action: 0 units.",
