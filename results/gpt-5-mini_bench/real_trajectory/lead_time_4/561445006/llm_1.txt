Historical demand (weekly): 2019-01-07:61, 2019-01-14:71, 2019-01-21:61, 2019-01-28:52, 2019-02-04:51 \u2192 5-week average = 59 units/week with a mild downward trend last two weeks (52,51). Lead time / pipeline: Promised lead time = 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet to confirm actual lead time and no in-transit stock; treat promised L=4 for planning. Decision logic: Must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because orders placed now will not arrive until Period 6 arrival phase. Use conservative forecast = 5 * 59 = 295 units to cover expected demand over the coverage window. Given modest historical variability and relatively high unit profit ($4) versus holding cost ($1/period), I round to 300 for a small safety buffer (\u2248+1.7%) to avoid stockouts if short-term demand is slightly above average. This balances service (avoid lost sales) against holding cost exposure. No evidence of lost shipments or changed lead time yet. Monitor arrivals/concludes to update future orders.",

Recent 5-period average including a spike \u224824 units/week; given Christmas uplift, use conservative forecast \u224825/week \u2192 5*25=125 units required. In-transit 100 covers most of that, so place a small replenishment to cover lift and provide minimal safety stock while avoiding excessive holding cost (holding=$1/period vs profit=$4).
