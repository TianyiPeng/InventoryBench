With L=4 we must cover 5 future periods; pipeline+on-hand = 84 units, which at recent demand rates (~18 units/week or lower) covers ~4\u20139 weeks \u2014 adequate to avoid stockouts. Ordering more now would raise holding cost ($1/unit/period) while marginal profit ($4) is insufficient to justify excess inventory given clear lower-demand regime. Therefore I override OR and place no order this period to avoid overstock; monitor arrivals and sales to re-assess next period.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Overrode OR's 149 \u2192 ordered 0 because confirmed 4-period lead time plus in-transit 83 (plus on-hand 1) already covers projected low recent demand; avoid unnecessary holding cost.",
