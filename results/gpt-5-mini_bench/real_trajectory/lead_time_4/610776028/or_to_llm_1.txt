My assessment: recent demand shows a clear upward trend (last observation 27 >> mean 10.4), occurring right before current period (2019-02-04). This suggests demand is rising, not stationary as OR assumes. Risk tradeoff: holding cost equals profit, so over-ordering is costly; but ordering too little risks lost sales as demand appears to be accelerating. No concluded arrivals exist to suggest lead-time problems or lost shipments. Decision: moderately override OR upward to cover potential sustained higher demand while limiting holding risk. I increase the order from OR's 30 to 35 units (\u2248 +17%) to provide additional coverage for the observed upward shift over the next (L+1)=5 periods without creating excessive inventory given equal profit/holding cost.
