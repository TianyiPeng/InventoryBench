Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: 0,0,8,17,27 (mean=10.4/week) showing recent uptick but limited history; on-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet. Promised lead time is 4 periods and no lead-time evidence exists, so keep L at default (promised). Use default demand estimators to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and scaled volatility from all samples, which balances service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5 \u2192 z*=0). This avoids overfitting to the short recent spike while provisioning for higher demand over the review+lead horizon.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand history shows rising trend with a large spike in Period 1 (demand=77). No concluded arrivals yet (ordered 30 arrived=0) so cannot infer lead-time change. To respond to the apparent demand uplift while remaining conservative on lead time, use promised lead time (default) and compute demand parameters from the most recent 3 samples to capture the new regime quickly: mu_hat recent_N=3, sigma_hat recent_N=3. This raises the (1+L)-period forecast to cover higher short-term demand while relying on default lead time until arrival evidence appears.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Recent demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean \u224810.4 units/week and elevated variance. On-hand=0, in-transit=124 (orders placed but no arrivals have been concluded yet). Promised lead time is 4 periods and there are no concluded arrivals to infer a different actual lead time, so use default lead time. Use default demand aggregation ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default volatility (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR backend applies the historical mean+uncertainty over the full review+lead horizon. This keeps parameters conservative given limited history and prevents overreacting to inconclusive missing-arrival signals while the promised 4-period lead time window has not yet passed.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=195 (recent orders placed but no concluded arrivals yet). Promised lead time is 4 and no concluded arrival messages exist to infer a different lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (0,0,8,17,27) give a low baseline. Given lack of evidence for a changepoint or lead-time shift, use defaults so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std with promised L=4\u2014this balances service vs holding cost conservatively while awaiting arrival confirmations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent realized demand (Periods1-4) is much higher than historical Jan samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=280 (sum of orders P1-P4) \u2014 none have concluded, indicating promised lead time (4) is not being met. I set L explicit=7 to allow buffer for delayed/lost shipments. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the new high-demand regime (periods 1-4 average demand=134.75) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=4 to capture recent volatility. These choices raise target base-stock to avoid stockouts under the new demand while acknowledging delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Missing arrivals: orders placed P1-P4 (total 280) remain in-transit with no arrivals observed \u2192 actual lead time > promised 4 or shipments delayed/lost; Demand regime shift: recent 4-period average demand=134.75 vs historical sample mean=10.4 (sustained increase across 4 periods).

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 6 (2019-03-18): recent demand has jumped sharply (recent windows >> historical sample mean). On-hand=0, in-transit=454 (many outstanding orders). Concluded arrivals show an order placed in P1 arrived in P5 \u2192 observed lead time = 4. To reflect the sustained high-demand regime I set L via observed lead times and use recent_N=4 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecasting on the most recent demand regime (captures recent mean/volatility over last 4 periods and scales for (1+L)). This balances service (respond to demand surge) vs holding cost by using recent demand stats rather than long-run low historical mean.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent demand has shifted sharply upward (periods 1-6 demand: 77,143,176,143,129,138) versus historical sample mean 10.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=541 \u2014 pipeline large enough to cover upcoming demand. Lead time evidence: two concluded arrivals show W=4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6); adopt calculated average lead time. To capture the sustained high-demand regime, set demand estimates using recent data (last 6 periods) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and variability, while L uses observed lead times to align arrivals. This balances service level (avoid stockouts in a higher-demand regime) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent demand has been consistently high (Period1-7 demands: 77,143,176,143,129,138,200) indicating a sustained higher-demand regime versus historical samples. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded messages (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). On-hand=0, in-transit=601. I use calculate for L to lock in the observed lead time, and recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L) demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 7 periods of realized demand, which helps the OR backend size base-stock to meet the new higher demand while accounting for recent variability.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08 (Period 9). Demand has been elevated and sustained over recent periods (Period5-8 demands: 129,138,200,194) vs historical pre-spike samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=634 units (large pipeline covering several periods). Past concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (orders from P1-P4 arrived in P5-P8). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead-time data (captures confirmed 4-period LT). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=4 (use last 4 concluded demand periods 5-8 to capture the new high-demand regime for the (1+L) review+lead aggregation). For volatility I use recent_N N=4 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the sustained higher demand while the OR engine's cap will limit over-ordering given the already-large in-transit volume.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent demand has jumped and stayed high since Period 5 (demands P5-P9 = 129,138,200,194,184; recent 5-pt avg = 169). On-hand=20, in-transit=623 (several large orders in pipeline; arrivals from P5 confirmed in P9). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods for concluded orders (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9). I select L=calculate to use observed lead times (reflecting confirmed L=4). Demand forecast will use recent data to capture the sustained higher regime: mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 (uses the 5 most recent demand samples, scaled by (1+L)). Volatility is elevated in the recent regime, so sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent std. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the new, sustained higher demand while accounting for confirmed lead time and the large pipeline to avoid under-ordering or excessive holding.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand has shifted sharply higher and sustained: periods 5-10 show consistently ~129-200 weekly demand versus historical sample mean ~10.4. On-hand=71 and in-transit=644 provide substantial coverage, but demand regime has clearly changed so use recent samples for forecasting. Set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead-time evidence (concluded arrivals show lead time=4). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the six-period high-demand regime (Periods 5-10). This balances service (capture elevated mean/volatility) against holding cost by using recent data rather than long-run low historical mean.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent demand has been high and stable over the last 4 concluded periods (avg demand \u2248134.75) versus historical sample mean 10.4, and lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded arrivals. On-hand=65, in-transit=611 provides substantial pipeline cover, but demand regime is higher so forecast should use recent data. Set L to calculate (use observed lead-times average=4). Set mu_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime across the review+lead period. Set sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture recent demand volatility. These choices bias orders toward serving the sustained higher demand while relying on confirmed lead-time evidence and current pipeline to avoid over-ordering.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). Recent demand has shifted materially upward versus historical pre-season samples: last 8 demands (P5\u2013P12) = [129,138,200,194,184,130,137,72], mean=148.0 indicating a new higher-demand regime starting P5. On-hand=111 and in-transit=624 provide substantial coverage but OR should size orders to the new regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so use promised/default L. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=8 to capture the sustained regime since P5 (N chosen = regime length capped by data). Use recent_N for sigma with same N to reflect current volatility. These parameters align the backend's base-stock to the higher recent mean while keeping variability estimates localized to recent behavior, balancing service level versus holding cost given profit=holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13): recent concluded demand is much higher than the historical sample mean (recent 5-period demands: P9-P13 = [184,130,137,72,46], mean \u2248113.8) and lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concl. On-hand=258, in-transit=436 (ample pipeline). To capture the recent elevated demand regime while using the promised/confirmed lead time, set L to default (promised=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (higher demand) against holding cost given large current pipeline.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand=425, in-transit=234. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1..P10 all arrived with W=4). Recent demand (Periods 9-14 = 184,130,137,72,46,35) shows a higher-demand regime earlier (Periods 9-11) then a decline; to capture recent dynamics I use a recent window covering the last 6 periods so the forecast balances the earlier spikes and the recent taper. I set L to "calculate" so backend confirms observed average lead time=4 from concluded history. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=6 to make the base-stock and safety-stock responsive to the recent demand pattern while avoiding overreacting to a single low period. This choice helps the OR backend balance service level (covering the earlier spikes) versus holding cost (by including the recent downtrend).

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). On-hand=474, in-transit=136. Historical concludes show actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods and recent demand has moderated (recent weeks: 46,35,49). Inventory is high vs current demand, so use conservative defaults to avoid excess holding. Choose L=default to trust promised/confirmed lead time; mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so backend uses full-sample statistics and caps orders, limiting new receipts while current on-hand covers demand.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/3 (Period 17). Recent realized demand has been high and sustained versus the small historical 5-sample seed, but arrivals since Period 5\u201316 show actual lead time = promised 4 and steady replenishments. Current on-hand=543, in-transit=5 (low pipeline). Use promised lead time to keep OR engine assumptions aligned with observed arrivals and use default demand estimates seeded by full-sample history to avoid overfitting the short high-demand spike. Choices: L=default (promised 4); mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and remain conservative; sigma_hat=default so backend computes volatility from full sample. These settings balance service (given large on-hand) against holding cost and rely on backend capped-order logic to limit ordering.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent demand has been much higher and more volatile than historical samples (sustained high-demand regime since Period 5). On-hand=311, in-transit=0 \u2192 ample immediate coverage but no pipeline. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods, so set L by calculating observed average. For demand forecasting use recent_N (N=13) to capture the sustained post-changepoint regime (Periods 5\u201317) for both mean and volatility, so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean and variability and guide the OR backend to maintain higher base stock while balancing holding cost given profit=holding cost symmetry.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand is elevated and volatile (recent demands include 62, 237, 282 and prior weeks >> historical sample mean). Current inventory: on-hand=29, in-transit=235 (pending arrivals). Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods; use promised/default L to keep alignment with observed arrivals. To capture the recent high-demand regime, set mu_hat using recent_N (N=8) so the backend computes (1+L)*mean over the most recent 8 samples; similarly use recent_N (N=8) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock to protect service during sustained higher demand while sigma from recent data prevents underestimating risk; using default L avoids mis-specifying lead time given confirmations and visible arrivals.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24. On-hand=0, in-transit=507. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals), so use calculated average lead time. Demand has shifted up starting around Period 13 (sustained higher weekly demand); use recent_N for demand estimates using the last 7 periods to capture the new regime (Period13-19 sample count=7). sigma_hat also use recent_N with N=7 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters raise base_stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the new demand regime while letting the OR backend cap orders per its policy.

Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes. To capture the sustained elevated demand I use recent_N over the most recent regime: set L to promised/default (confirmed =4) and compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 16 periods since the detected changepoint (Period 5\u2192Period 20 = 16 periods) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet (1+L) periods of elevated demand while reflecting recent volatility.

Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior conclude messages. I set L to default (use promised lead time=4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 samples). Volatility also set to recent_N N=4 to reflect recent variability. These choices bias orders up to meet the elevated demand while keeping sigma estimated from the same recent window so the OR backend balances service level vs holding cost appropriately.

To be responsive to the sustained higher recent demand while respecting the promised lead time, I keep L as default (promised=4) and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts based on the most recent demand regime and volatility rather than the low historical 2019 sample mean. This balances service (avoid stockouts given high recent demand) against holding cost given substantial current pipeline.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-29. Recent demand has been on a higher regime: last 8 demands (P17-P24) avg \u2248164 units/week vs historical sample mean 10.4. On-hand=330 + in-transit=360 -> pipeline=690 units. Observed lead times in concluded history consistently 4 periods. To capture the sustained higher demand while reflecting confirmed lead time, set L to be calculated from observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service for the new demand regime while limiting excess inventory given holding cost = profit.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05): on-hand=310, in-transit=434. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no new lead-time evidence. Recent demand (Periods 18-25) is higher and more variable than the early Jan samples, so I use recent data to forecast (capture current regime). Set L to promised/default (4). Use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent 8 concluded demand observations, balancing service vs holding given profit=holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent conclues confirm actual lead time = 4 and current inventory is healthy (on-hand=474, in-transit=194). Profit=Holding so q=0.5 (balanced service vs cost). No new sustained changepoint in demand or lead time since the last confirmation. Use promised/default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, leaving cap checks to the engine.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand has been elevated and stable (~100/week over the last 5 weeks) while on-hand=341 and in-transit=130. Past conclude messages confirm actual lead time ~4 and earlier missing arrivals have resolved, so use promised lead time. To focus the forecast on the current high-demand regime I use recent_N=5 for demand mean and volatility (captures periods 24-28). This yields mu_hat and sigma_hat computed over the most recent 5 samples across the (1+L) review+lead horizon, balancing service (cover upcoming 5 periods of ~100/wk demand) against holding cost given existing high on-hand inventory.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=397, in-transit=0. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (confirmed in Period 6), so use promised/default lead time. Recent demand (many periods of 70\u2013280, recent weeks 74\u2013105) shows elevated sustained demand vs initial tiny samples; no new sustained changepoint since lead time and demand pattern are stable in concluded history.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09): on-hand=326, in-transit=148 (pipeline=474). Recent demand shows no new regime shift: last 4 demands = [92,105,74,71], mean=85.5.

On-hand=253 and in-transit=148 provide coverage but recent demand justifies sizing forecast to the most recent regime.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/30 (Period 34). On-hand=134, in-transit=167. Historical early sample mean=10.4 but recent weekly demand has been much higher and more volatile; latest 4 weeks show demands [71,73,38,81] (avg~65.8). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior periods. To capture the recent elevated demand regime while limiting noise from distant low-demand samples, set L to promised (default) and use recent_N=8 for demand mean and volatility to weight recent weeks while smoothing short-term spikes. This balances service (higher mu_hat) against holding cost given profit=holding so z* implies moderate service level.

LLM Rationale:

Recent demand (Periods 28-34) shows a lower, more stable regime vs the earlier spike; to avoid excess holding cost I use a recent-sample forecast. L set to promised (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=8 (capture recent 8-week demand regime while satisfying (1+L) review+lead coverage). This reduces orders versus using the long-run historical tiny-sample mean which is outdated and avoids overstock given current high on-hand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/10/14 (Period 36). Current on-hand=195, in-transit=124. Promised lead time=4 and historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time =4 (no new contrary evidence). Recent demand (last 8 concluded periods: P28-P35) averages ~66 units/week, which is materially higher than the very early historical samples and reflects the current regime. I therefore use the promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using recent_N=8 to capture the current demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean over these 8 samples). I also use recent_N=8 for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep safety stock aligned to current observed demand while avoiding overweighting old low-demand samples; with profit=holding, the backend will balance service level vs holding costs accordingly.

=== Period 36 Summary ===
610776028: ordered=12, arrived=19 units (ordered on Period 32, lead_time was 4 periods), starting on-hand inventory=214, demand=40, sold=40, ending on-hand inventory=174

Daily Reward (R_t): $-134.00

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has stabilized around ~40-80 units/week (last ~8 periods: demands = 44,43,40,71,73,38,81,44 -> avg \u2248 55). On-hand=174, in-transit=117 -> pipeline covers several weeks, no overdue shipments visible in conclude history; lead time has been confirmed historically as 4. To tune service vs holding cost I use recent demand to set mu_hat and sigma_hat (focus on last 8 weeks) while leaving L as promised (default=4). This keeps orders responsive to current demand without inflating safety stock from old high-volatility periods.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). On-hand=118, in-transit=117. Historical sample seed is small (mean=10.4) but recent realized weekly demand is materially higher (last 5 concluded demands: P33-37 = 81,44,43,40,56; recent mean \u224852.8) indicating a sustained higher regime vs the tiny seed sample. Lead time has repeatedly observed =4 in concluded history (no new evidence of change). To reflect the recent demand regime while keeping the confirmed promised lead time, I set L to default (promised =4) and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, improving service while controlling hold costs given the verified LT=4 and higher demand sample.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=155, in-transit=65. Historical conclude messages consistently show observed lead times = 4 (confirmed earlier), so set L to be calculated from observed lead times. Demand has stabilized since summer (no new sustained regime shift detected), so use default demand/volatility estimates to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This balances service vs holding given profit=holding (q=0.5) so the backend will target a moderate base stock.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). On-hand=136, in-transit=247. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods \u2014 use calculated average to let backend confirm (stable evidence). Recent demand regime has settled lower than the earlier spike; last 8 concluded demands (Periods 32-39) average ~48.6 units/week, so use recent_N=8 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture current demand level and volatility. This (1) aligns the forecast window with the observed lead time, (2) avoids diluting estimates with older high-spike data, and (3) balances service level vs holding cost by sizing base-stock to recent demand and variability.

Daily Reward (R_t): $-88.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand has settled around ~40-45 units (last 5 concluded demands: P36-P40 = 40,56,44,43,30; mean \u224842.6) while historical early samples are much lower \u2014 recent behavior is the relevant regime. On-hand =118 and in-transit=235 (pipeline totals 353) which already covers multiple weeks of demand; no current evidence of lost shipments and recent concluded lead times consistently equal promised 4. I therefore keep L at default (promised=4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the current regime (N=5); this keeps the base-stock responsive to the higher recent demand while sigma from recent data reflects current volatility. These parameters prioritize service (profit and lost-sales avoidance) given profit=holding cost, while avoiding excess long-term holding by using a short recent window.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=84, in-transit=235. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = promised 4 periods. Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods) = [56, 44, 43, 30, 34], mean=41.4 units/week; with review+lead (1+L)=5 this implies (1+L)\xd7mean \u2248 207. I set L to default (promised 4) because lead time was confirmed as 4 in history. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the current lower-variance, stable demand regime; this balances service level (reduce stockouts) while avoiding excessive holding cost given current on-hand + in-transit (total pipeline 319 units covers ~7.7 weeks at recent mean).

On-hand=52, in-transit=206 \u2192 pipeline=258 which already covers much of the 5-period (L+1) exposure. Lead time previously confirmed as 4. To keep responsiveness to recent demand while leveraging current pipeline, set L=default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat to reflect the most recent regime (5\xd7mean of last 4 weeks). Use recent_N (N=4) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility for safety stock.

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). On-hand=227, in-transit=0. Recent demands through Periods 34-43 show moderate weekly demand (roughly 30\u201380 units) and lead-time history consistently 4 periods. To keep the OR backend aligned with observed lead time and use full-sample demand statistics, set L by calculation (observed lead times average \u22484), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) with holding costs by relying on aggregated demand estimates rather than short-window churn.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Current on-hand=200, in-transit=198. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods; no new sustained lead-time change. Recent demand (last ~12 weeks) shows a lower, stable regime vs earlier spikes, so I use a recent-window forecast to capture current demand. Using L=default keeps promised lead time (4). mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N=12 to capture the current demand mean/volatility over the review+lead horizon, which reduces overstating future demand and limits holding costs while preserving service given substantial pipeline inventory.

On-hand=175, in-transit=198 => pipeline inventory=373, which covers multiple upcoming weeks given low demand. Historical concluded lead times have consistently been 4 periods. To reflect confirmed lead time behavior and stable demand I select L by averaging observed lead times and use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies the full-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L). This avoids overreacting to short-term noise while the strong pipeline reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Date 2019/12/30. Recent weekly demand has been low and stable (last 4 weeks: 27,25,33,33) with no sustained uptick; historical series shows frequent 4-period actual lead time confirmations. Current position: on-hand=142, in-transit=270 (total pipeline=412) \u2014 coverage is ample vs recent demand. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its full-sample mean/variance (stable regime, no new changepoint). This avoids overreacting to short-term noise and balances service (using pipeline) against holding cost.
