Given high profit/low holding (q\u22480.95) OR uses a high service target but caps order; OR cannot see lost shipments or lead-time changes. Decision: follow OR recommendation of 130 units. Rationale: (1) Ordering 130 is the capped policy suggestion and avoids large overorders if the in-transit 123 actually arrives (avoids unnecessary holding cost if shipment is merely delayed). (2) If the in-transit 123 is later confirmed lost (no conclude after promised lead time), we will detect that in subsequent periods and can escalate ordering then.
