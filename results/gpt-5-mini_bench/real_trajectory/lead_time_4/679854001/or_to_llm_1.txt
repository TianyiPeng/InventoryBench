Period 47 (2019/12/30) Hybrid Decision:
======================================================================
{
  "rationale": "Observed actual lead time = 4 (concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals). Recent demand has declined from the earlier high regime; Periods 40\u201346 average \u224830\u201335/week (Periods 40\u201344 avg \u224834.8, P45\u201346 = 27,31). On-hand = 207, in-transit = 0. With promised/observed L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 weeks of demand; 5\xd735\u2248175 units, which is below current on-hand. OR's capped baseline (154) assumes a much higher demand regime and would push inventory well above needed levels, increasing holding cost. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) the OR fractile is aggressive, but current on-hand already covers 5+ weeks at current demand. Therefore order 0 to avoid excess holding cost and let on-hand meet demand while we monitor for any sustained demand rebound or arrival anomalies.",
  "short_rationale_for_human": "Order 0 (vs OR 154): confirmed lead time = 4 and recent demand fallen to ~30\u201335/week; on-hand 207 already covers ~5 weeks so no replenishment now.",
