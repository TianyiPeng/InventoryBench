No clear abrupt shift visible. c) Lead time & missing orders: Promised lead time = 4 periods.

Following guidance to cover (L+1) periods of demand and using forecast \u22485/week, required coverage = 5*(4+1)=25 units. e) Final order logic: Place an order of 25 units to cover expected demand over the lead-time horizon while keeping safety stock minimal given limited evidence of demand volatility. Holding cost ($1/unit/period) is small relative to profit ($19/unit), so favor filling the pipeline to avoid stockouts.",

Forecast: near-term demand expected ~30\u201340/week given recent run-rate; ordering now would arrive after 4 periods (too late for any Xmas lift) and risks excess holding cost ($1/unit/period) vs. $19 profit. Action: do not order this period to avoid excess holding cost and because current on-hand covers several weeks of expected demand (190 on-hand \u22485\u20136 weeks at ~30\u201340/week).",

{
  "rationale": "World/calendar: Period 47 is 2019-12-30 (week between Christmas and New Year). For a knit cardigan, year-end demand is typically subdued after peak holiday purchases. Demand analysis: recent concluded weeks (P43\u2013P46) = 33,35,27,31 (avg \u224831/wk) \u2014 consistent with the downshift documented in prior carry-over insights (Periods 35\u201339 avg\u224866 then falling). No new sustained regime change is evident. Lead time: historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods; no in-transit stock. Inventory/pipeline: on-hand = 159, in-transit = 0; 159 units covers ~5 weeks at current avg demand (~31/wk). Cost tradeoff: profit $19/unit vs holding $1/unit/period \u2014 holding is small but demand appears low and volatile; with 4-period supplier lead time, we should avoid creating excess inventory before year turnover. Action decision: place no order this period to draw down inventory toward nearer-term demand, avoid holding excess through uncertain holiday-to-new-year demand. ",
