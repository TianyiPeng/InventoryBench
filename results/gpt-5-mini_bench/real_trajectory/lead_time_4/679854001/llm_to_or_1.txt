Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical weekly demand samples (5): [1,6,7,5,5] mean=4.8 \u2014 no clear changepoint or seasonality from available data. Promised lead time is 4 periods and there is no evidence of delayed or lost shipments yet. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility from full sample, which balances service level against the low holding cost given limited data.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~4.8 units/week. Recent Period 1 demand was a large spike (18) but it's a single period\u2014insufficient to declare a regime shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=9 (ordered in P1) \u2014 cannot conclude arrivals yet vs promised lead time (4). Use promised lead time and default demand estimates ((1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to let the OR engine compute base-stock and caps while we gather more evidence of any sustained demand or lead-time change.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly samples (Jan) show low mean (~4.8/wk) but recent realized demand in closed periods is very high (Period1=18, Period2=79). No concluded arrivals yet (both Period1 and Period2 orders show arrived=0), so there is no confirmed change in actual lead time. On-hand=0, in-transit=26. To avoid overfitting to two high-demand observations and because carry-over rules require stronger evidence, use default lead time and default demand/statistics so the OR backend applies its standard (1+L) aggregation and variance scaling. This balances service-level desire given recent spikes against holding cost risk if the spike is transient.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=89 (orders placed P1=9, P2=17, P3=63) and no concluded arrivals yet. Historical weekly demand samples: [1,6,7,5,5], mean=4.8. Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals past promised lead time have been observed so there is no confirmed lead-time change. Use default (promised) lead time and default demand/statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies its standard base-stock calculation while preserving simplicity given limited evidence of regime change. This balances service level and holding cost conservatively until arrivals/arrival patterns provide clear signals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand (Periods 1-4: 18,79,56,71) is much higher than older Jan samples (1,6,7,5,5), indicating a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-02-11. No concluded arrivals yet, so do not override promised lead time. Set L=default to use promised 4-period lead time. For demand forecast and volatility, use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (most recent 4 periods). This raises base-stock to meet (1+L)-period demand while sigma from recent samples reflects current variability, balancing service level (avoid stockouts given high demand) against holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting 2019-02-11: recent avg (Periods 2019-02-11 to 2019-03-04) = 56.0 versus prior sample avg (2019-01 dates) = 4.8 (+51.2 absolute, >1000% relative); sustained for 4 periods.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18. Recent sustained demand regime shift since 2019-02-11: recent avg demand \u224856 over 4 weeks vs prior avg \u22484.8. On-hand=0, in-transit=251 (covers multiple future periods). Period 5 conclude confirms an actual 4-period lead time (P1\u2192arrived P5). I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to confirm/lock lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime ((1+L)*mean will reflect 5\xd756). Sigma uses recent_N N=4 to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices ensure the OR backend targets service for the new higher mean while the large in-transit pipeline limits over-ordering.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived P5, observed lead_time=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent demand has shifted to a higher regime (sustained high demand since 2019-02-11; recent periods demand = 56,71,88,105). On-hand=0, in-transit=330 (large pipeline from prior delayed arrivals). Lead time evidence (arrivals in Periods 5\u20136) confirms 4-period actual lead time. I set L using observed lead times (calculate) to reflect confirmed LT=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (uses most recent 4 periods of demand) so the OR backend raises base stock to meet elevated demand while pipeline (330) will prevent over-ordering this period.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01): recent demand regime (from 2019-02-11) is sustained high (weekly demands 18,79,56,71,88,105,110). On-hand=0, in-transit=382 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to recent weekly demand (~55\u2013110). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes; promised lead time is 4, so keep default L. To capture the sustained higher-demand regime, use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat (covers the 7 post-changepoint samples). This biases base_stock toward the new higher demand while the OR cap will limit excessive ordering despite large pipeline, balancing service level and holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-02-11 (Periods 5-8 demands = 88,105,110,161). Lead time has been empirically confirmed as 4 periods (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8). On-hand=0, in-transit=423 which covers ~3.6 periods at the recent mean (~116/week) but is short of (1+L)=5 periods of demand. To capture the new high-demand regime while respecting observed lead time, I set L to calculate (use observed lead times) and use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds base_stock from the confirmed high recent mean/volatility rather than the low historical pre-shift mean. This biases orders upward to avoid stockouts while letting the OR backend cap extreme orders.

Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods in concluded messages. Use L="calculate" to lock in observed lead time average=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=8 (last 8 demand samples) so the backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility reflecting the new high-demand regime and balances service vs. holding cost.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Demand has been in a sustained higher regime since 2019-02-11 (many periods with demand >> historical Jan samples). On-hand=19, in-transit=509 so pipeline is large and covers multiple periods; promised lead time is 4 and prior conclude messages confirm actual lead time=4. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime I use recent_N for demand moments (captures the last 10 periods since the regime change). L kept as default (promised 4). Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock calculation on the elevated recent mean and volatility, improving service while the large in-transit reduces urgent ordering risk.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Demand has shifted to a higher sustained regime since 2019-02-11 (high weekly demand observed through Period 11). On-hand (18) + in-transit (442) = 460 units provides substantial coverage; to align the OR backend with the sustained higher demand I set L by calculating observed lead times and use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base forecast and volatility on the full post-shift regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-06. On-hand=0, in-transit=457 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. Demand has shifted up starting 2019-02-11 and the recent high-demand regime spans Periods 5\u201312 (8 periods). To reflect confirmed lead time and recent elevated demand while avoiding over-ordering given large in-transit, I set L by calculating observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 8 demand periods to capture the new regime's mean and volatility. This balances service (capture higher demand) against holding cost given the substantial pipeline.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13. On-hand=102, in-transit=446. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). Recent demand regime is the higher level that began in Period 5: last 5 concluded period demands (P9-P13) = [108,77,116,137,66], recent mean=100.8. I set L explicitly to 4 to reflect confirmed lead time. I use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to target the elevated demand regime (backend will compute (1+L)*mean over these 5). I use recent_N (N=5) for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. These choices ensure the OR engine builds a base stock sized to the sustained higher-demand regime while reflecting confirmed lead time and recent variability; existing on-hand + large in-transit reduces need for aggressive extra ordering.

I set L explicitly to 4 to reflect confirmed LT. For demand I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the sustained post-changepoint high-demand regime (last 10 demand observations) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base stock and safety stock to current demand volatility while avoiding distortion from the small pre-shift samples.

Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 (regime length from Period 5 to 15 = 11 periods) so the OR backend targets the current higher-demand regime and balances service level vs holding cost.

Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift starting 2019-02-11 with much higher weekly demand. To reflect the new regime and recent demand variability, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (all observed =4). Use recent_N for demand mean and volatility using the most recent regime (Periods 5\u201316, 12 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current higher demand and its variability and let the OR backend size base-stock accordingly.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10. Demand regime shifted up starting 2019-02-11 and has persisted (high weekly demand since Period 5). On-hand=27, in-transit=533 (pipeline ample vs demand). Lead-time observations consistently 4 periods (confirmed in history). To capture the sustained high-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates with N=13 (Periods 5\u201317), and use calculate for L to reflect observed lead time. This yields a base-stock that targets service given current high demand while the large in-transit reduces immediate ordering aggressiveness. Sigma uses the same recent window to reflect current volatility.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time historically confirmed at 4 periods. To capture the sustained post-changepoint demand I use recent_N for demand mean and volatility using the most recent regime samples (N=14, approx. Periods since 2019-02-11). L left as default (promised 4). Recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the new higher-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline will be accounted for by the OR engine when computing net orders, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/24 (Period 20). Current on-hand=30, in-transit=542 \u2014 ample pipeline covering multiple weeks but subject to lead-time confirmation/loss. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, ...), so set L using observed average. Demand shifted up sharply starting 2019-02-11 and has remained elevated; to capture the new regime I use recent demand samples. Given high profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1) we favor a higher service target by forecasting from the recent elevated regime. Therefore: L="calculate" (observed avg lead time = 4); mu_hat="recent_N" with N=15 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime since 2019-02-11; sigma_hat="recent_N" with N=15 to capture recent volatility. These choices let the OR backend size base stock for the sustained higher demand while acknowledging confirmed lead time and balancing service level vs holding cost.

For demand I use recent_N (N=16) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period forecast and volatility on the post-changepoint regime (use most recent 16 periods since the sustained shift), which keeps service high while avoiding excess holding given large pipeline.

Current on-hand=151 and in-transit=393 (pipeline total=544) provides coverage; to keep service while controlling holding cost I set L from observed data and use recent-demand estimates to reflect the sustained high-demand regime. Chosen methods: L by calculate (uses observed lead times ~4); mu_hat recent_N=20 and sigma_hat recent_N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the recent high-demand regime rather than the tiny Jan samples, which avoids underordering and lost sales while the OR backend applies its capped ordering.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22. Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-02-11 (sustained); recent weekly demand centers around ~100\u2013160. On-hand=133 and in-transit=423 provides strong pipeline coverage for L=4. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes. I choose L=default to use the promised (and confirmed) 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=8) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent stable high-demand regime (balances service vs holding cost given large pipeline). This keeps orders responsive to the elevated demand while avoiding excess safety stock from older low-demand samples.

Historical concludes show a sustained demand regime shift beginning 2019-02-11 (large, sustained weekly demand ~100s) and observed lead time consistently =4 periods. Pipeline (on-hand + in-transit = 551) is ample vs recent weekly demand, but to keep service during the high-demand regime I rely on recent demand. Set L to promised (default=4). For demand I use recent_N (N=20) to capture the sustained high-demand regime across many recent weeks; same recent_N (N=20) for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR backend focused on the current high-demand mean/variance while respecting the confirmed 4-period lead time and avoiding overstating older low-demand samples.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand regime (established from 2019-02-11) is much higher than the Jan samples and has been sustained through Period 25; confirmed lead time historically = 4. On-hand=171 + in-transit=408 provides large pipeline cover. Use promised lead time (default=4). For demand forecast and volatility use recent_N over the most recent 20 demand samples to reflect the sustained high-demand regime and reduce influence of small Jan samples; sigma likewise recent_N over 20 to capture current variability. These choices keep base_stock aligned to the elevated, sustained demand while letting the capped order limit moderate order sizes to control holding cost.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12. On-hand=178, in-transit=394; historical concludes consistently show actual lead time=4. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift upward beginning 2019-02-11 (higher, persistent weekly demand). To reflect the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat from recent data while keeping L at the promised/default (4). Using recent_N (N=20) captures the most recent 20 weeks of demand to align the base-stock with current demand and volatility, reducing stockouts while the OR backend applies its service-level cap given profit/holding costs.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19. Demand has been in the higher regime since 2019-02-11 (sustained); historical lead time repeatedly observed = 4. Current on-hand=194 and in-transit=365 (ample pipeline). To respect confirmed lead time and the sustained demand regime, set L to default (promised=4) and compute demand parameters from the recent regime using recent_N with N=20 (captures most recent ~5 months of weekly data) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat. This biases the OR base-stock toward the higher recent mean/volatility while the cap prevents excessive single-period orders given large pipeline inventory.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime beginning 2019-02-11 (documented earlier); on-hand=188, in-transit=377 (total pipeline 565) which comfortably covers several future weeks but demand remains elevated. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history. To align the OR base-stock with the sustained high-demand regime while using observed LT=promised, I use default L (promised=4) so backend uses the known promised LT. For demand mean and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to capture the recent high-demand regime (longer-lasting regime; cap N at 20 per rules) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat reflects sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This keeps safety stock responsive to the sustained uplift while limiting excess holding given current strong pipeline (helps the OR cap reduce new orders if pipeline already large).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Demand regime shifted to a sustained higher level starting 2019-02-11 (long-run high demand since Period 5). To capture the current high-demand regime I use recent data: set L by averaging observed lead times (confirming 4). For demand and volatility I use recent_N with N=20 to reflect the most recent sustained high-demand regime (regime length >20), giving the OR engine a (1+L)-period forecast and updated dispersion to balance service level (high profit $19 vs holding $1 encourages higher fill) against holding cost.

On-hand=146, in-transit=368 (pipeline ample). Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed actual lead time=4. For demand forecast use recent_N to capture the post-change demand regime (use N=20 to cover the recent stable window while capping sensitivity). Use the same recent_N=20 for sigma to estimate volatility from the same window. These choices align the base-stock target with the sustained higher demand while relying on observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering.

Early-Jan samples are not representative\u2014demand regime shifted up starting 2019-02-11 and has persisted. To capture the elevated, stable demand regime I use a recent-window estimate. L set to calculate to confirm observed lead time=4; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained regime (~many weeks) rather than the tiny Jan sample. This raises target base-stock to meet high demand while capping orders via the OR engine to limit excess holding given holding cost $1/unit.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent weekly demand has been ~100\u2013120 units for many weeks (Periods 20\u201332 sold mostly 90\u2013119), a sustained high-demand regime vs. the tiny Jan seed samples. On-hand=124, in-transit=412 \u2192 pipeline=536 units which roughly covers 5 periods of ~105/week (1+L=5). Use promised lead time to keep OR engine aligned with supplier terms and past confirmations. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=20 to reflect the sustained high-demand regime (captures the most recent 20 demand observations to compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std), which keeps service level appropriate while avoiding overweighting the small Jan seed data.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-07 (Period 35). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals show lead_time=4). Demand has been in the elevated regime since 2019-02-11 (sustained high weekly demand ~100s). On-hand=52, in-transit=463 provides substantial pipeline but demand remains high so forecast should reflect the elevated regime not the small-sample pre-shift data. Set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (all observed lead_times = 4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=20 to capture the sustained high-demand regime and its volatility while smoothing short-term noise; this yields (1+L)*recent mean and sqrt(1+L)*recent std for the OR engine to compute base stock. High profit vs holding cost implies a high service target; using recent data prevents understocking given confirmed demand shift and large pipeline uncertainty.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent history shows sustained high weekly demand since Feb (confirmed earlier) and actual lead time observed = 4. Current inventory: on-hand=93, in-transit=460 \u2014 pipeline is large relative to on-hand and should cover upcoming periods. I choose to trust the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and use default demand and volatility computations so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This keeps the base-stock anchored to the long-run observed demand while the large in-transit volume prevents aggressive additional ordering and limits holding cost exposure.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=118, in-transit=419. Historical concludes show stable actual lead time = 4 (observed repeatedly P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ...). Demand has been in the elevated regime since Period 5 (sustained high weekly demand ~80\u2013160). I set L to default (promised=4) because concluded history confirms actual L=4. I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the sustained high-demand regime (N=20 captures the most recent ~20 weeks of observed demand, balancing recency and sample size). This reduces the influence of the tiny Jan samples and gives the OR backend a (1+L)-scaled mean and volatility that match the current regime. Given on-hand + in-transit (537 units total), these parameters will let the capped base-stock rule avoid excessive extra ordering while preserving service during the high-demand regime.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). Demand has been in a sustained high regime since 2019-02-11 (large, stable weekly sales ~80\u2013160); lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=133 and in-transit=383 provide substantial pipeline cover, but demand remains elevated so we must forecast using the recent high-demand regime. Set L to default (promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=20 to capture the recent sustained regime (regime length >20; N capped at 20) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This prioritizes service (using recent high mean) while sigma from recent data sets safety stock; given profit >> holding cost, targeting recent-driven base stock reduces stockouts without excessive holding cost.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). History shows consistent observed lead_time=4 (many concluded arrivals at 4); on-hand=226, in-transit=299. Recent demand has trended down from summer peaks; to protect against recent lower weekly demand I base demand forecast on the last 5 concluded weeks (Periods 34-38) so the OR backend uses a (1+L)-scaled recent mean and recent std. I keep L as default (promised=4) because concluded history repeatedly confirms lead_time=4. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat captures the recent downward demand regime and reduces excess holding while preserving service given high profit/low holding (q\u22480.95).

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and current inventory is high (on-hand 307, in-transit 177). Demand regime shifted up in Feb and has since settled; recent weekly demand has moderated (last ~10-20 periods averaging below the earlier peaks). To avoid overstock while maintaining service given low holding cost ($1) vs profit ($19), use the promised/default lead time and base demand estimates on the most recent data (capture recent regime behaviour). I choose recent_N=20 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest ~20-week demand pattern while smoothing older regime transitions; L kept as default (promised 4). This balances service level (protects against ongoing weekly demand) against holding costs given already-large on-hand inventory.

Daily Reward (R_t): $30.00

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent weekly demand has fallen from the spring/summer regime (~100s) to lower values in Nov (recent demands: 52, 41, 20) but the earlier, sustained regime shift (Feb\u2192Mar increase) and stable lead-time evidence support using the baseline/default estimators. On-hand=350 and in-transit=197 provide ample pipeline cover; no concluded arrivals are overdue. I choose L=default to keep promised 4-period lead time (historical concludes consistently show 4). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the engine blend long-run demand with safety stock while capping order sizes to avoid excess inventory given high on-hand levels. This avoids overreacting to short low-demand blurbs in Nov while preserving service level given the 4-period lead time.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25. Recent demand has fallen sharply vs earlier 2019 peaks; Periods 39-41 demands = [41,20,22] indicating a new low-demand regime starting Period 39. On-hand=381 + in-transit=192 provides large coverage vs current low demand; lead time has been consistently observed as 4. I set L using calculated evidence of observed lead times. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=3 to capture the new low-demand regime (use the last 3 concluded demands) so the OR engine lowers target base-stock and reduces over-ordering while preserving service given confirmed L=4. This balances profit (high margin) against holding cost by reducing expected (L+1)-period demand and tightening safety stock to observed recent volatility.

To let the OR engine use full-sample demand statistics and the confirmed lead time, I select default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service (use full history) vs. holding cost given already-high on-hand inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-09. Recent weekly demand has been low (Period 43 demand=33) after earlier high-season volumes; on-hand=325, in-transit=230 so pipeline inventory is ample vs. expected demand. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4. I choose default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std. This conservative choice leverages full-sample stats given ample on-hand+in-transit to avoid unnecessary new receipts and to balance service level (profit>holding cost) against holding cost minimization.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Demand has been in the higher post-2019-02-11 regime (sustained spike vs Jan). On-hand=373, in-transit=175 \u2014 healthy pipeline but season (Dec) can be volatile so continue using recent demand rather than Jan baseline. Lead time has been observed as 4 periods consistently. I select L=default (promised 4). For forecasting I use recent_N (N=20) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained, higher-demand regime and recent seasonality; this biases orders toward higher service given profit=$19 vs holding=$1 (high critical ratio), while using recent volatility to avoid overordering for short spikes.

Date 2019-12-23. On-hand=394, in-transit=127. Historical concluded lead times consistently =4 periods; recent demand (Periods 39-45) has been lower and less volatile than the early-year surge. To avoid overstocking given high on-hand and recent lower demand, keep L at promised (4) and use recent_N=7 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the most recent 7 periods (captures Nov\u2013Dec behavior and lower variance), which reduces target base-stock and holding cost while preserving service.

Recent weekly demand (Periods 39-46) shows a lower regime with some noise; I use a recent_N estimate (N=8) to capture current demand level and volatility. I keep L=default (promised 4) because concluded history confirms 4-period arrivals historically. Using recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the base-stock on the current low-demand regime to avoid excess holding cost while preserving service given high on-hand inventory.
