Forecast using conservative blended mean \u2248 21 units/week; 5-period coverage \u2248 105 units. Rounding to a practical order size and allowing a small buffer for the recent spike, I order 110 units. This balances service (avoid stockouts during potential Valentine/early-Feb demand) versus holding cost ($1/unit/period) given high profit ($19/unit). Monitor upcoming periods to confirm if spike sustains and adjust future orders if necessary.",
