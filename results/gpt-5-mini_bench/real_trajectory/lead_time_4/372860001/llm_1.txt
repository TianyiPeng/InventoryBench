Demand analysis: recent demand has moderated \u2014 last 4 periods (P43-P46) avg \u2248202 units; last 8 periods avg \u2248233 units. Use conservative forecast \u2248230 units/period. Lead time: confirmed = 4 periods (from prior conclude messages). Pipeline requirement: must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand \u2192 5 * 230 = 1,150 units. Inventory assessment: on-hand = 180, in-transit = 865 \u2192 total pipeline = 1,045 units, shortfall \u2248105 units. Decision logic: marginal profit $19 >> holding cost $1, so fill the shortfall plus a small safety buffer to avoid stockouts if demand is slightly higher. Order 150 units to cover shortfall and buffer. ",
