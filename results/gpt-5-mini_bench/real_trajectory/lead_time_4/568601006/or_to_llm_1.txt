Given high profit-to-holding ratio (profit $19 vs holding $1 \u2192 critical fractile \u22480.95) stockouts are costly relative to holding, so I favor filling the estimated shortfall rather than strictly following OR's cap. Final strategy: place an order of 660 units to bring pipeline + order up to expected 5-period demand (~867 units), reducing probability of stockouts across the lead horizon. This accepts some holding cost but protects high margin sales. Monitor future concluded arrivals to update actual lead time and adjust orders if shipments arrive earlier/later or are lost.",
