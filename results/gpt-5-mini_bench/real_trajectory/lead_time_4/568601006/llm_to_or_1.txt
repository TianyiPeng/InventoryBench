Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly sales show mild upward variability (samples 161,145,179,196,186; mean\u2248173.4). On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we need replenishment coverage. No concluded arrivals or lead-time observations yet, so use promised lead time and historical-sample based demand/volatility. Choose default L (promised=4), default mu_hat (uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples) and default sigma_hat (uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the OR engine computes a base-stock that balances $19 profit vs $1 holding cost using full-sample statistics.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Historical weekly demand (5 samples) mean=173.4. On-hand=0, in-transit=207 (order placed P1 not yet concluded). Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals yet so keep L as default. Use default demand scaling: mu_hat=(1+L)*mean -> captures expected demand over review+lead window (5\xd7173.4=867). Use default sigma_hat to reflect observed variability (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples \u224840.8). These settings tell the OR engine to target a base-stock that covers the 5-period demand mean with safety stock proportional to historical volatility, while recognizing current pipeline (207) is below the 5-period mean so backend will place replenishment up to its cap.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Recent observed demand (Periods 1-2) is substantially above the Jan historical samples (227 and 284 vs historical mean ~173), suggesting a recent upward demand shift. On-hand=0, in-transit=437 \u2014 sizable pipeline but arrivals have not concluded yet. I will keep L as default (promised 4) because we lack 3+ periods of concluded arrivals to confirm any lead-time change. For demand I use an EWMA to tilt the forecast toward the recent high demands (gamma=0.5). Sigma is left as default because variance estimate from all samples is still informative and we do not yet have enough concluded post-shift data to justify reducing variance. These settings bias the OR engine to raise the base-stock to cover the apparent recent demand uptick while relying on the backend's capping rule to limit over-ordering given the large in-transit pipeline.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04 (Period 4). On-hand=0, in-transit=759. Historical demand samples (weeks in Jan\u2013Feb) show mean ~173 and small sample size; promised lead time is 4. No concluded arrivals yet (orders placed in P1\u2013P3 will not be expected to conclude until P5+ given promised L=4), so no evidence to change lead time or demand regime. Use defaults so OR backend uses full-sample mean/variance and promised lead time, keeping policy stable while awaiting arrival confirmations.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). Recent observed weekly demand samples (provided history) average ~173.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=1027 (orders placed in P1\u2013P4) but no concluded arrivals yet. Because no concluded arrivals exist, actual lead time is unconfirmed; use promised lead time to avoid over-adjusting. Set L=default (promised 4). Use mu_hat=default so backend targets (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) to cover the next 5 periods of demand given the 4-period promise. Use sigma_hat=default so backend computes volatility from all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level (cover L+1 periods) against holding cost while awaiting confirmed arrival evidence.

Carry-over insight: No arrivals observed for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 (ordered: 207, 230, 322, 268); possible delayed or lost shipments\u2014monitor for concluded arrivals before changing lead-time estimate.

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Historical weekly demand mean = 173.4 (samples: 161,145,179,196,186). Recent conclude shows the Period 1 order arrived in Period 5 (lead_time = 4), so actual lead time matches the promised 4. On-hand=0, in-transit=937 (large pipeline from prior orders). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time average (evidence: P1\u2192arrival in P5). I use default demand sizing: mu_hat='default' (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples = 5\xd7173.4 = 867) and sigma_hat='default' (backend will compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples). These choices reflect confirmed lead time, use all available demand history to produce stable base-stock while the large current pipeline reduces immediate ordering urgency.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: order placed Period 1 arrived in Period 5 conclude, lead_time = 4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25): recent realized weekly demand ~215 (Periods 5-6) vs historical sample mean 173.4; on-hand=15, in-transit=915 (large pipeline from prior orders). Orders placed in Periods 1\u20132 confirmed lead_time=4 (observed). No current evidence of lost shipments. Given confirmed L=4 and materially higher recent demand, set L via calculation of observed lead times, set mu_hat explicitly to cover (1+L)\xd7forecasted weekly demand \u22485\xd7215=1075 to ensure high service (profit/holding implies q\u22480.95), and leave sigma_hat as default so backend uses historical volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances service level vs holding cost while acknowledging a large in-transit pipeline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 8 (2019-04-01). Lead time evidence: orders placed P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7 all show lead_time=4 \u2014 treat L as confirmed. Recent realized weekly demand (Periods 3\u20137): 198,214,215,215,186 -> sustained higher mean vs historic sample mean (173.4). On-hand 151 + in-transit 869 = 1020 units (large pipeline) but demand regime has risen; set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N to capture the new demand level and volatility while L set from observed lead times. This balances service level (capture higher demand) against holding cost given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: Periods 3\u20137 avg demand = 205.6 vs historical sample mean 173.4 (+18.6%), sustained for 5 periods; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08): recent demand remains elevated vs historical samples. On-hand=170, in-transit=658 (pipeline ample covering (1+L) periods). Historical concluded arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4. I set L via calculate to use observed lead times. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=6) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (Periods 3\u20138). Volatility likewise uses recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent variability. These choices bias orders upward to meet higher demand while letting the OR engine cap orders to limit overstock given large pipeline.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime extension: Periods 3\u20138 avg demand = 212.8 vs historical sample mean 173.4 (+22.6%); Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8).

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15): recent history shows a sustained demand uplift from Periods 3\u20138 (reported earlier +22.6% vs historical samples) and observed lead time consistently = 4 periods. On-hand=109, in-transit=789 provides strong pipeline cover. I keep L as promised (default) since concluded history confirms 4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to capture the shifted demand regime (Periods 3\u20138) so the OR engine scales target base-stock and safety stock to the new higher mean and recent volatility, while avoiding dilution by older low-demand samples. This balances service (reduce stockouts under higher demand) vs holding cost given large in-transit volume.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/22 (Period 11). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8 observations). On-hand=187, in-transit=824 \u2192 pipeline=1011, which comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods of elevated recent demand. I use L=calculate to reflect confirmed observed lead time=4. Demand has shifted up since Period 3; to capture the recent higher mean/variance I use recent_N with N=6 (using the last 6 demand observations) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the elevated regime while limiting excess holding given holding cost.

Period 12 (2019-04-29): on-hand=336, in-transit=665. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; no new sustained demand regime change since prior insights. I therefore use the promised/default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from available samples. This is conservative given ample pipeline inventory and balances service level (use confirmed L=4) against holding cost.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent history shows a sustained higher-demand regime from Periods 3\u20138 (avg 212.8 vs historical 173.4, +22.6%) and consistent concluded arrivals indicating actual lead time = 4. Current inventory: on-hand=202, in-transit=727 (ample pipeline). I set L to 'calculate' to use observed lead times (confirmed =4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=6 to capture the elevated regime (Periods 3\u20138) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of last 6 demand samples; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the base-stock responsive to the higher-demand regime while the confirmed L=4 aligns ordering timing with observed arrivals, avoiding understock despite earlier delays.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent demand elevated vs historical but has softened; periods 3-13 avg \u2248187.5 vs historical sample mean 173.4 (+8%). On-hand=290, in-transit=601 (pipeline healthy). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded history (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13) so use calculated average lead time. To capture the sustained post-changepoint regime starting Period 3, set mu_hat using recent_N over the regime (N=11, periods 3\u201313). Use default sigma_hat (sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) to let backend use full-sample volatility. These choices keep orders responsive to the higher recent mean while relying on observed lead time and conservative volatility for service/holding tradeoff.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/20 (Period 15). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods for multiple orders. On-hand=337, in-transit=552 provides ample pipeline but demand has shown variation: an earlier sustained upward regime (Periods 3\u20138) then softer demand in Periods 9\u201314. To respect confirmed lead time while letting the OR backend adapt to both recent and historical demand, set L using calculate (observed lead times). Use an EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to blend longer-run elevated regime with recent softer weeks. Keep sigma_hat default so backend uses full-sample volatility scaled by (1+L). This balances service (use confirmed L and responsiveness in demand mean) against holding cost given current full pipeline.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=311, in-transit=622. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 confirmations). Demand has been in the higher regime since Period 3 (sustained elevated demand through Periods 3\u201315). To reflect confirmed lead time and recent elevated demand, set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will return 4). Use recent_N=13 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the forecast and volatility on the most recent sustained regime (Periods 3\u201315 \u2192 N=13), which balances service level against holding cost given profit=$19 and holding=$1.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=262, in-transit=628. Historical concluded arrivals repeatedly confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P1->P5 ... P12->P16 observations). Demand has been above historical sample mean for many periods (sustained regime increase noted earlier). To balance service level vs holding cost: keep promised lead time (L=default=4) since arrivals align with promise; use recent demand to capture the elevated regime for forecast and volatility. Chosen methods: L=default uses promised lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=6) to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of most recent 6 demand samples capturing the higher recent demand; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to reduce stockouts given confirmed lead time and sustained higher demand, while sigma_hat controls safety stock to limit excess holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Observed lead time consistently 4 periods in concluded history (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8, P5->P9, P6->P10, P7->P11, P8->P12, P9->P13, P10->P14, P11->P15, P12->P16, P13->P17) \u2014 use calculated L to reflect observed reality. On-hand=266 and in-transit=536 provide healthy coverage; no new sustained demand regime shift since prior insight, so use default demand estimates based on full sample history to avoid overfitting to recent volatility.

Recent history shows a sustained demand uplift vs original samples but the most recent 6 demand observations (Periods 13-18) average ~154 \u2014 I use a recent-window forecast to capture the current regime while not over-weighting older data. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages, so I let backend calculate average observed lead time. On-hand=321 and in-transit=594 provides a healthy pipeline; using recent_N for mu and sigma keeps orders aligned to realized demand and limits excess safety stock given holding cost=1 and profit=19.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=386, in-transit=407. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple confirmed P1->P5...P15->P19). Recent demand has been above historical sample mean (sustained uplift noted in prior carry-over through Period 9 and continued higher weekly sales thereafter). To reflect the sustained higher demand while keeping lead-time as promised, I set L to default (promised=4). For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the recent elevated regime while smoothing short-term noise. I apply the same recent_N=10 to sigma_hat so safety stock reflects recent variability. These choices bias the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts given confirmed L=4 and elevated demand, while sigma based on recent variability tempers excessive holdings given holding cost=$1/unit.

Given confirmed LT=4 and no new sustained demand regime shift since prior recorded extension, use calculated lead time to reflect observed data and default demand/volatility estimates ((1+L)\xd7mean of samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so the OR backend applies its base-stock calibration with full sample-based \u03bc\u0302/\u03c3\u0302.

LLM Rationale:
Period 23 (2019-07-15). On-hand=484, in-transit=437. Actual lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history; therefore keep promised lead time. Recent demand shows a clear downward regime starting around Period 18; to reflect this, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 periods (Periods 18\u201322) so the OR backend targets stock for the current low-demand regime and avoids excess holding cost.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: Periods 18\u201322 avg demand = 114.0 vs prior recent regime avg 212.8 (\u221246.3%), sustained for 5 periods; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple observed P->P+4 arrivals).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 24 (2019-07-22). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods through multiple concluded arrivals (confirmed P1->P5 ... P18->P22). Recent demand settled into the lower regime since Period 18 (insight: Periods 18\u201322 avg = 114; Period 23 demand = 120). On-hand = 364, in-transit = 437 \u2192 total pipeline 801, which comfortably covers (1+L)\xd7recent demand. I therefore keep L at the promised/default (4). For demand forecast I use a recent_N estimate to capture the lowered regime (use last 5 periods to reflect Periods 19\u201323 behavior). Likewise use recent_N for sigma to reflect recent volatility. These settings give the OR engine a (1+L)\xd7recent mean and recent volatility so orders will be modest (pipeline already high) and avoid excess holding costs while maintaining service for the current lower-demand regime.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. Recent demand has fallen from prior high regime: Periods 18\u201324 demands = [139,122,73,116,120,120,63], recent mean \u2248107.6. On-hand (359) + in-transit (379) = 738 units, which is large relative to recent demand; using a recent_N forecast (N=7) will anchor mu_hat and sigma_hat to the new lower regime and avoid excess ordering while preserving service. Set L to default (promised/confirmed 4), mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=7 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized since Period 18: last 8 demands (P18\u2013P25) avg \u2248105.9 units/week vs historical sample mean 173.4 (\u2248 \u221239%). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple P\u2192P+4 arrivals). On-hand 517 + in-transit 127 = 644 units, which covers ~6.1 weeks at the recent demand rate (644 / 105.9), so current pipeline is healthy versus the low-demand regime. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed lead time (4). For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=8 to reflect the sustained lower-demand regime (N chosen = length of recent regime, between 3 and 20). These settings align the OR base-stock calculation to the new lower mean and observed variability, reducing excess holding while preserving service given the confirmed lead time.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). On-hand=498, in-transit=0. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Recent demand has fallen from the prior high regime; periods 18\u201326 average demand \u2248110 units. To avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand and a sustained lower-demand regime, keep promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates using the recent 9-period regime (periods 18\u201326). This targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean for mu_hat and recent volatility for sigma_hat so the OR engine reduces ordering while preserving service with confirmed L=4.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 18: Periods 18\u201326 avg demand = 110.33 vs prior recent regime avg 212.8 (\u221248.2%), sustained for 9 periods; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple observed P->P+4 arrivals).

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=197, in-transit=157. Historical arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 periods repeatedly; use promised lead time. Recent demand shows volatility with a single large spike in Period 27 (301) but only one period \u2014 not yet a sustained regime change. To balance service level vs holding cost I use a short recent window (last 5 periods: P23\u2013P27) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect recent lower baseline plus the recent spike without over-committing inventory. L kept as default (promised=4).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019/08/26). Recent history: lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Demand regime since Period 18 has been lower (Periods 18\u201326 avg \u2248110) despite two recent high-demand spikes in P27\u201328; spikes are not yet a sustained regime change. On-hand=0, in-transit=455 (covers several future periods). I set L by calculate to reflect observed lead times. For demand I use recent_N (N=11) to anchor forecasts to the sustained low-demand regime since Period 18 (captures Periods 18\u201328), and sigma_hat recent_N N=11 to measure volatility in that same regime. These choices keep target base-stock aligned with the confirmed lower-demand regime while the pipeline provides cover for short-term spikes, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). On-hand=0, in-transit=715. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (many P->P+4 arrivals). Recent demand spike starting Period 27 (301,251,231) appears sustained for 3 periods. Given confirmed LT=4, I use calculate for L to let backend infer observed average lead time. To capture the new high-demand regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (covers Periods 27\u201329) so the base-stock reflects the spike and reduces expected stockouts while sigma from the same window captures increased volatility. This balances higher service needs vs holding cost given strong recent demand evidence and large in-transit volume.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27: Periods 27\u201329 avg demand = 261.0 vs prior regime avg 110.33 (+136%), sustained 3 periods; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple observed P->P+4 arrivals)

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). Recent demand has spiked: Periods 27\u201330 demand = [301,251,231,357], avg=285 (vs prior regime avg ~110), sustained 4 periods. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history. On-hand=0, in-transit=1036 (pipeline large). Set L by calculating observed lead times (will return 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new high-demand regime (forecast (1+L)\xd7mean of last 4 samples and volatility from last 4 samples). This raises target base-stock to meet elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline limits new ordering magnitude.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime update at Period 27: Periods 27\u201330 avg demand = 285.0 vs prior regime avg 110.33 (+158%), sustained 4 periods; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple observed P->P+4 arrivals).

On-hand=0, in-transit=1257 (sufficient pipeline coverage). I keep L as default (promised = 4, which matches observed).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand elevated since Period 27 (periods 27\u201332 showing high weekly demand: 301,251,231,357,328,341) while lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=1351 (sufficient pipeline to cover multiple weeks of elevated demand). I keep L at the promised/default (4) because concluded arrivals confirm LT=4 repeatedly. For demand I use recent_N over the latest detected high-demand regime (start Period 27) to capture the new higher mean and volatility: N=6 (Periods 27\u201332). This increases mu_hat to reflect the higher rolling demand across review+lead and uses recent volatility for sigma_hat so the OR backend raises target base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts during this sustained higher-demand regime while controlling holding cost by relying on pipeline visibility.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=1435 which covers multiple future demands given confirmed lead time=4. Recent demand has shifted sharply up: Periods 27\u201333 demands = [301,251,231,357,328,341,612], avg\u2248345.9 over 7 periods. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). To capture the new high-demand regime I use recent-N demand estimates (N=7) for mu and sigma so the OR engine targets higher base stock; L set to calculated average observed lead time (4) to align with concluded arrivals and avoid underordering given the persistent regime shift.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 27 extended: Periods 27\u201333 avg demand = 345.86 vs prior regime avg 110.33 (+213%), sustained for 7 periods; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple observed P->P+4 arrivals).

Daily Reward (R_t): $5939.00

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=8, in-transit=1668; historical concluded arrivals consistently confirm actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand regime since Period 27 is elevated (Periods 27\u201333 avg \u2248 345.9, sustained), so I forecast using the recent high-demand regime. L: use promised/default lead time (4) consistent with multiple P->P+4 observations. mu_hat: use recent_N (N=8) to capture the sustained high-demand regime (regime length \u2248 Periods 27\u201334). sigma_hat: use recent_N (N=8) to capture volatility in the recent regime. These settings keep the OR engine focused on the higher recent mean and variance while respecting confirmed lead time; with large in-transit stock the capped order will limit new receipts and avoid excess holding costs.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (multiple P -> P+4 arrivals). Recent demand is in a high regime since Period 27 (Periods 27\u201335 avg \u2248345.9; most recent 5 periods avg \u2248375.4). On-hand=103, in-transit=1755 (large pipeline). I keep L as default (promised=4) because concluded arrivals confirm LT=4. For demand I use recent_N to capture the current high-demand regime: mu_hat recent_N (N=9) uses the last 9 demand samples (Periods 27\u201335) so the base stock reflects elevated demand. I match sigma_hat to recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent volatility. These choices align the backend's (1+L)-period forecast to the currently-elevated demand while the large in-transit pipeline mitigates risk of immediate stockouts.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in concluded history (multiple P -> P+4 arrivals). Recent demand has shifted to a higher regime since Period 27 (sustained; recent weeks P30\u2013P36: 357,328,341,612,313,283,282) and on-hand (213) + large pipeline (1592) are ample. I keep L at the promised/default (4) and use recent_N=10 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (covers the most recent 10 demand observations) so the OR backend raises the base-stock to meet the new mean while estimating volatility from the same recent window.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=244, in-transit=1485 (pipeline=1729). Recent demand has been in a high regime since Period 27 (periods 31\u201337 mean \u2248353 units/week); lead time repeatedly observed = 4. To capture the sustained elevated demand I set L to promised (confirmed) and use recent_N for demand stats with N=7 (covers the recent high-demand regime). This raises \u03bc\u0302 and \u03c3\u0302 to reflect the higher mean and volatility so the OR engine builds pipeline for (1+L)=5 periods of demand and balances service level vs holding cost given profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand remains elevated vs historical baseline: last 5 observed demands (Periods 34-38) = [313,283,282,313,385], suggesting the high-demand regime that began at Period 27 persists. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history (multiple P -> P+4 arrivals). On-hand=413 and in-transit=1396 give substantial pipeline cover; nevertheless OR needs demand forecast over review+lead (1+L) periods. I set L to default (use promised lead time = 4) because concluded history confirms LT=4 and no evidence of lost shipments beyond normal variability. I set mu_hat to recent_N (N=5) to capture the current high-demand regime using the last 5 demand samples, so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean(recent 5). I set sigma_hat to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility over the same window. These choices keep the forecast aligned to the sustained higher demand while relying on the confirmed lead time, balancing service level and holding cost given a large existing pipeline.

Lead time repeatedly observed as 4 periods. I set L to calculated (use observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N with N=13 to capture the sustained post-Period-27 high-demand regime (regime length 13 periods from P27\u2013P39). Sigma uses recent_N N=13 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep the OR base-stock responsive to the higher-demand regime while relying on confirmed LT=4 so orders cover (1+L) review+lead horizon.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). On-hand=590, in-transit=874. Observed lead time consistently 4 periods across concluded history; no evidence of lost shipments recently. Recent demand (Periods 35\u201341) = [283,282,313,385,231,278,245], avg \u2248 288; this is below the prior high regime (Periods 27\u201333 avg 345.86) but not a sustained collapse\u2014use recent window to capture current demand. Choose L=default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=7) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect current 7-period demand regime, so the OR backend will size base stock to recent demand and recent volatility, balancing service (profit $19) against holding cost ($1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

Date 2019/12/23 (Period 46). On-hand=0, in-transit=1924 (large pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods. Recent demand (Periods 34\u201345, 12 samples) has averaged ~316 units/week with elevated volatility and a large spike (Period 42=733). I keep L as the promised lead time (default=4) because concluded history confirms it. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=12 to capture the current elevated demand regime (uses the last 12 observed demands to forecast (1+L)-period demand and volatility). This biases the OR engine toward higher base stock to avoid stockouts during the sustained high-demand/post-spike period while the large in-transit inventory will cap orders per the backend cap.

Daily Reward (R_t): $2397.00

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history; on-hand=35, in-transit=1938 (large pipeline). Recent demand has had volatility and spikes earlier in year, but current pipeline is ample so avoid inflating forecast. Use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L); this keeps orders conservative given heavy in-transit inventory and confirmed L=4.
