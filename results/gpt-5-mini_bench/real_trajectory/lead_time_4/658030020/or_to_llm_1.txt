  "rationale": "Lead-time: confirmed as 4 periods (carry-over). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=400 (these are orders from P43\u2013P46 and will arrive during Period 47 before demand). Recent demand (P42\u2013P46): 66,45,99,106,85 \u2192 avg \u2248 80.2 units/week. Required cover for (L+1)=5 periods \u2248 5\xd780.2 \u2248 401 units. Pipeline (400) essentially matches the 5-period demand coverage, so no incremental order is needed now. OR recommended 87 units, but that would push inventory above the near-term target and increase holding cost; given confirmed lead time and full pipeline, follow a zero-order to avoid excess holding cost. No new sustained pattern to record.",
