Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand shows a sharp jump on 2019-02-04 (166) vs prior weeks (35,42,47,58), suggesting a possible upward regime but only one high obs so far. On-hand=0, in-transit=0 so we must replenish to cover review+lead (1+L) periods. Set L to default (promised 4) since no concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to weight the most recent regime (weeks 2019-01-21, 2019-01-28, 2019-02-04) so the OR engine will target a high service level (profit/total cost -> q\u22480.95) and react to the emerging spike while limiting sensitivity to older low-demand weeks.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent demand jumped (2019-02-04=166, Period1 demand=187) versus earlier weeks (35,42,47,58). An order of 199 placed Period1 shows arrived=0 in Period1 conclude (promised L=4 still in effect; no concluded arrivals yet). I use default lead time (promised 4) because we lack concluded lead-time observations. To capture the recent higher-demand regime while remaining conservative, I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=3 (uses the three most recent demand samples: 58,166,187) so the backend will raise the base-stock to cover elevated demand for (1+L) periods while accounting for recent volatility. This addresses the missing arrival by increasing coverage without overcommitting to an unconfirmed permanent shift.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). On-hand=0, in-transit=450; two prior orders (P1:199, P2:251) have not yet concluded arrivals\u2014still within promised lead time (4), so no confirmed lead-time change. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07..2019-02-04) show mean ~69.6; I'll use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std across all samples. This is conservative given the large in-transit volume and avoids overreacting to non-concluded shipments while covering the review+lead demand window.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. Recent realized weekly demand (Period1-3 conclude) = [187, 138, 90], showing a downward trend after a spike vs historical Jan samples. Promised lead time is 4; no concluded arrivals yet so no evidence actual lead time differs. I choose L=default to use the promised 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent regime (weeks with high but falling demand) and scale by (1+L) so the OR backend stocks for the 5-period coverage. For sigma I use recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent demand variability. This balances service (protect against recent high weekly peaks) while avoiding inflating safety stock from older low-demand weeks; keeping L=default avoids overreacting to still-unconfirmed shipment delays.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/11 (Period 5). Recent realized weekly demands: Period1=187, P2=138, P3=90, P4=82. On-hand=0, in-transit=871 with four consecutive concluded periods showing arrived=0 for orders placed P1\u2013P4 (suggests promised L=4 is optimistic or shipments lost). I set L explicit=6 to conservatively account for prolonged/delayed arrivals beyond the promised 4 periods. For demand forecasting I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the current regime (higher recent weekly demand vs older samples). sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent demand variability. These choices bias the base-stock upward to avoid stockouts given delayed arrivals while using recent demand to avoid overstocking beyond observed recent demand pattern.

Carry-over insight: Four consecutive missed arrivals: orders placed in Periods 1\u20134 have arrived=0 in their conclude messages; implies actual lead time >4 or lost shipments; treat supply as delayed/loss-prone until confirmed otherwise.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1301.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent concluce shows P1 order arrived in P5 => actual lead time observed = 4 periods. Current on-hand=124, in-transit=877; pipeline + on-hand is ample vs recent weekly demand (~75 in P5) but earlier periods showed supply delays. Set L by calculating observed lead times to capture confirmed 4-period lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples) to reflect baseline demand forecast across review+lead period and allow OR engine to size safety stock given estimated volatility. This balances service (profit high relative to holding cost) while avoiding excess explicit increases given one confirmed lead-time observation and stable recent demand.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: P1 order arrived P5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25. Recent demand has stabilized near ~75\u201382 units/week (Periods 4\u20136: 82,75,74). On-hand=301 + in-transit=626 = 927 units in pipeline, which already far exceeds coverage for (1+L) periods. Lead time inference: two concluded arrivals show lead_time=4; use calculated L to reflect observed history. Choose mu_hat recent_N (N=3) to capture the most recent stable demand regime (mean \u224877 \xd7 (1+L)=5 \u2192 \u2248385 forecast over review+lead period) so the base-stock targets recent demand, not the earlier high volatility. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=3) to reflect current low volatility and avoid inflating safety stock. These settings keep service high while preventing additional unnecessary ordering given large existing pipeline and low holding cost tradeoff (profit $19 vs holding $1).

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/1 (Period 8). Recent realized arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7). On-hand=406, in-transit=422 \u2014 pipeline sizable vs recent weekly demand (Periods 5\u20137 demands = 75,74,99). I set L to 'calculate' to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed =4). Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=3) because demand since arrivals (Periods 5\u20137) defines a new, lower regime (avg \u224883) compared with earlier high values; using the last 3 periods captures current run-rate. Volatility likewise uses recent_N (N=3) to reflect recent variability. These choices prioritize service for current observed demand while avoiding excess stock from earlier higher-demand samples.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. History shows four consecutive concluded arrivals with lead_time=4 (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8) \u2014 actual lead time confirmed as 4. Current inventory: on-hand=530, in-transit=205 (ample coverage vs recent weekly demand). Profit/Holding => q=19/(19+1)=0.95 -> high service target. I choose L by calculation (use observed lead times) to reflect confirmed LT=4, and keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this leverages full history while letting the backend set the high service stock given the favorable profit/holding ratio and current ample pipeline.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). On-hand=676, in-transit=0. Recent realized demands (Periods 5\u20139): [75,74,99,93,59], mean\u224880; earlier periods (1\u20134) were unusually high due to initial backlog. Concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P5 arrived after 4 periods). I set L by calculating observed lead times to lock in the confirmed lead time, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the current lower-demand regime (captures last 5 weeks mean and volatility). This keeps base_stock responsive to the recent demand drop while the L=4 setting ensures the pipeline covers the correct (1+L) review+lead horizon and avoids under-ordering given confirmed 4-period deliveries. Using recent_N for sigma also tightens safety stock to recent variability, balancing profit ($19) against low holding cost ($1).

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22 (Period 11). On-hand=639, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages show multiple orders with lead_time=4 (orders on P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P5\u2192P9) \u2014 actual lead time confirmed as 4. Supply was previously delayed but is now consistent at LT=4. I choose L='calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (will return 4). I choose mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all demand samples, preserving full-sample stability while incorporating the confirmed lead time. This balances service (using confirmed LT) against holding cost given large on-hand and zero in-transit; defaults avoid overreacting to short recent dips in demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). On-hand=594, in-transit=0. Historical conclues show consistent lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P5 arrived with W=4). Recent demand has been moderate (period demands in history averaging well below current on-hand). To reflect confirmed supply lead time, set L by 'calculate' (average observed lead times = 4). Given large on-hand stock and no pipeline, use default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this avoids unnecessary new orders while preserving the high service level implied by profit/holding (q\u22480.95).

Date 2019-05-06 (Period 13). On-hand=515, in-transit=0, recent demand (Periods 9\u201312) moderate (59,37,45,79). Lead time has been observed repeatedly as 4 periods; choose to let backend use observed average.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P5 arrived with lead_time=4); no new missing/lost-shipment pattern since lead time confirmation. Demand has trended lower since the March peak; to let the OR backend use full historical mean/variance with confirmed lead time, I select lead time inference by calculation (average observed lead times = 4) and use default demand/volatility calculations so the backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from samples. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) and holding cost (default \u03bc\u0302 uses all data rather than overweighting recent spike).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-20 (Period 15). Recent demand has softened versus the earlier spike; last 6 concluded demands = [59,37,45,79,58,56] (mean \u224855.7). On-hand=401, in-transit=110 (orders from P13/P14) \u2014 pipeline looks healthy so we should use a recent demand estimate to avoid excess holding cost. Observed concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 for multiple past orders (P1\u2192P5 arrivals had lead_time=4), so set lead time via calculated observed history. I choose L by calculate (average observed lead times = 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the current lower regime and reduce mu_hat to (1+L)\xd7recent mean. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=6) to reflect recent volatility. These choices reduce over-ordering given high on-hand while preserving service level implied by profit/holding cost tradeoff.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). On-hand=309, in-transit=110 (pipeline adequate short-term). Demand since Period 5 appears to follow a lower, stable regime versus the early large spike; I use a recent-window forecast to capture current demand. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed=4). Use recent_N (N=11) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to base the (1+L)-period demand mean and volatility on the last 11 demand observations (Periods 5\u201315), which helps balance service level against low holding cost given ample on-hand inventory.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=263, in-transit=115. Earlier missing arrivals (P1\u2013P4) were resolved and lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods; no evidence of ongoing lost shipments. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (confirmed ~4). Recent demand (last 8 weeks: P9\u2013P16 = 59,37,45,79,58,56,92,46) reflects the current regime (no sustained spike like the Feb 166). To avoid bias from the early large outlier and to target current demand, I use recent_N with N=8 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base stock and cap reflect recent demand mean and volatility, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (orders from P1\u2013P4 arrived with W=4; P13 arrival also W=4), and there have been no new sustained demand regime shifts \u2014 recent weekly demand ranges 37\u201392 with no multi-period upward trend. On-hand=288, in-transit=53 gives ample cover; use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (using confirmed L=4) while avoiding extra safety stock given healthy on-hand inventory and modest holding cost.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent demand has stabilized around 37\u201392 units/week (last 5 demands: 56,92,46,37,43; mean \u224854.8). On-hand=293, in-transit=150 \u2014 ample short-term cover but shipments have previously been delayed then confirmed at 4 periods. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead-time history (confirmed as 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the current stable regime and avoid older outliers (e.g., 166 in Feb). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices provide a (1+L)-period forecast grounded in current demand while the calculated L ensures the pipeline target reflects observed 4-period lead time, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 20 (2019/6/24) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-24 (Period 20). Current on-hand=261, in-transit=150. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent observed lead_time = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P13\u2192P17, P14\u2192P18), so set L via calculate to reflect observed average. Demand has settled to a lower, stable regime since Period 5 (recent demands P5\u2013P19 mostly in the 30\u2013 ninety range, regime length \u224815 periods); to avoid the influence of early Feb spike, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (captures the current demand regime across review+lead). These choices align the OR backend's base-stock target with the confirmed lead time and recent demand, balancing service (use observed L and recent mean) against holding cost by avoiding inflation from early outliers.

Demand has settled lower than the early-Feb spike; recent weeks (last ~12 periods) reflect the current regime. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed arrivals; use recent_N (N=12) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast on the current lower-demand regime and reduce influence of the early high outlier. This keeps base-stock responsive to current demand while limiting excess holding given low holding cost.

Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods: P17\u2013P21 demands = 37,43,32,15,20) is lower and more stable than earlier high volatility; to avoid excess holding while preserving service, I set lead time based on observed history and base demand forecast/volatility on the most recent 5 periods.

Period 24 (2019-07-22). On-hand=289, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple orders with arrived units and lead_time=4). Earlier missed arrivals have been resolved and recent evidence is sustained. Given ample on-hand stock and confirmed LT=4, use calculated lead time (average of observed L) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this avoids overfitting to short recent volatility and lets the capped ordering rule limit replenishment to prevent excess holding costs while preserving service level.

Recent demand has settled lower than early-season spike; I use the last 8 demand observations (Periods 17\u201324: 37,43,32,15,20,27,60,33) to capture the current regime for both mean and variability. Setting mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N (N=8) produces a (1+L)-scaled forecast and volatility that reflect the current lower-demand regime and limits excess holding given low holding cost relative to profit.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent demand has been moderate: last 9 weekly demands = [37,43,32,15,20,27,60,33,50], mean \u224835.2/wk. On-hand=206 + in-transit=136 => pipeline=342 units, which comfortably covers ~5 periods of demand at recent mean (5\xd735.2\u2248176). Historical conclude messages consistently show 4-period actual lead time when arrivals occurred. I therefore set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed reality, and use recent_N (N=9) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime. This avoids overreacting to older high early-period demand and ensures the OR backend computes a base-stock aligned with current lower demand and confirmed lead time, reducing unnecessary holding costs while preserving service.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent weekly demand has been moderate (recent demands: P22\u2013P26 = 27,60,33,50,82; prior high spikes occurred early in the year). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time = 4 when shipments arrive (multiple P#: ordered -> arrived with W=4), so I use observed lead-time average. To keep the forecast focused on the current lower-demand regime I use a recent-window demand estimate (captures last several weeks' mean/variance). This also keeps ordering conservative given in-transit=136 and on-hand=124 while supply historically follows L=4 but has occasional delayed/lost shipments; using recent demand reduces excess holding costs but retains service via the OR backend's safety-stock formula.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/19 (Period 28). Recent demand has been elevated: last 4 weekly demands = [33,50,82,84] with mean \u224862.25. On-hand=40 and in-transit=189 (pipeline large but arrival uncertainty historically resolved to 4 periods). Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history. To balance service (profit $19) vs low holding cost ($1), I use a recent-window demand estimate to capture the upward shift and keep safety stock modest via sigma from the same window.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent demand has moderated but remains variable: last 5 weekly demands = [33,50,82,84,67] (Periods 24\u201328), average \u224863.2. On-hand=109, in-transit=157 (sizable pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently indicate a 4-period lead time (confirmed earlier), so use promised/default lead time. To keep safety aligned with recent demand regime and avoid excess holding given holding cost low but profit dominant, set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent 5 weeks so the OR engine sizes base stock to recent demand and adjusts volatility accordingly.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P13\u2192P17, P14\u2192P18, P16\u2192P20, P18\u2192P22, P24\u2192P28). Current inventory: on-hand=62, in-transit=256 (ample pipeline). Given confirmed LT=4 and no sustained demand regime shift, use calculated lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids over-ordering while preserving service level with observed LT.

Historical conclude messages show repeated arrivals with observed lead_time=4 (orders placed earlier consistently arrived 4 periods later), so use inferred lead time. With promised L=4 and confirmed observations, keep lead-time estimate reflecting observed behavior. Pipeline (386) covers multiple weeks of demand but current on-hand is zero; using default demand estimates avoids overfitting to recent variability. Selecting L by calculation (avg observed), and default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine compute base_stock and cap using full historical demand stats, balancing service level (profit >> holding cost) against inventory holding costs.

Recent demand has risen (last 6 weekly demands: P26\u2013P31 = 82,84,67,47,87,110) indicating a higher recent mean and volatility. Set L by calculate to reflect observed lead time=4. Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the recent demand regime (higher mean, higher variance) so the OR backend raises base stock to protect service while limiting excess inventory given low holding cost (holding=$1 vs profit=$19).

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent weeks show elevated demand vs early-year baseline (recent weekly sales: ...67,47,87,110,78...), while on-hand=26 and in-transit=372 (ample pipeline). Historical conclude messages consistently show 4-period arrivals; I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times. To reflect the recent demand regime I use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat (N=8) so the OR backend targets a base-stock that covers the (1+L) review+lead window using the most recent regime; using recent samples reduces overweighting early-year low demand and keeps safety stock responsive to current volatility. This balances service (capture current higher demand) against holding cost given sizable in-transit inventory.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 34 (2019-09-30). On-hand=0, in-transit=329. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (many orders with lead_time=4). Recent demand has spiked: Periods 31-33 demands = 110, 78, 152 (three consecutive high weeks). To protect service with observed LT=4 and recent higher demand, set L to 'calculate' (backend will infer observed average LT), and use recent_N for demand mean and volatility to reflect the new regime (N=3 captures P31-33). This increases target base_stock to cover the higher short-run demand while sigma from recent_N raises safety stock, balancing profit ($19) vs low holding cost ($1).

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 31: avg demand P31-33 = 113.3 units vs prior 6-period avg (~57 units) => +99% increase; sustain=3 periods (P31-P33).

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). Recent history shows confirmed actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded arrivals with W=4). Demand regime increased starting Period 31 (P31-34 demands: 110,78,152,96; higher mean ~109 vs earlier ~57). On-hand=34, in-transit=374 so pipeline is large but demand has shifted up; to capture the new regime I use recent_N on demand estimates (N=4 covering P31-34). L set to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=4. mu_hat recent_N (N=4) captures elevated (1+L)-period demand under the new regime. sigma_hat recent_N (N=4) captures recent volatility so OR backend sets safety stock accordingly while capped ordering limits will prevent runaway orders despite large pipeline.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-14 (Period 36). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (consistent arrivals Pn -> Pn+4). Demand shows a sustained regime shift starting Period 31 (P31\u2013P35 show elevated demand); I capture this by using recent_N=5 for demand mean/volatility so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher-demand regime while keeping L at the confirmed promised/observed 4. This balances higher service-level needs (avoid stockouts under elevated demand) against holding cost by limiting the horizon to the recent regime rather than all-history smoothing.

LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand elevated since Period 31 (sustained higher mean vs earlier history). On-hand=28, in-transit=528 (pipeline=556) so ample coverage but demand regime remains higher\u2014use recent data to set forecasts. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4; use promised lead time. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime (Periods 31-36) to capture the higher mean and volatility: use recent_N with N=6 (regime length=6). This balances service (capture higher demand) while OR backend cap will limit excessive ordering given existing pipeline and holding cost.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Observed actual lead time repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods in concluded messages (many P->P+4 arrivals). Recent demand regime shift began at Period 31 (P31-37 demand: 110,78,152,96,78,71,64) \u2014 sustained elevated demand vs earlier history. On-hand=20, in-transit=515 (ample pipeline). Choose L=default to use promised lead time (promised=4 and confirmed by observations). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=7 to target the sustained higher-demand regime (covers P31-37). Use sigma_hat recent_N with N=7 to capture volatility during this regime. These settings nudge base-stock upward to meet higher demand while cap logic limits excessive ordering given large pipeline, balancing service level (profit much larger than holding cost) against holding costs.

Historical conclude messages consistently show lead_time=4 (many arrivals match ordered\u2192arrived with W=4). I set L to calculate (use observed lead-times). For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (regime from P31\u2013P38, N=8) to make mu_hat and sigma_hat responsive to the sustained higher-demand regime while avoiding older low-demand data. This balances service (capture higher mean) versus holding cost by limiting the sample window to the new regime.

Historical conclude messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders: P1->P5, P2->P6,... through P35->P39), so use promised/default lead time. Demand regime: spike detected Periods 31-33 (avg P31-33 = 113.3 vs prior ~57) \u2014 recent changepoint length=3; to protect service during the higher-demand regime, use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine sizes base stock to the elevated recent mean/volatility while keeping L at promised value.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=294, in-transit=152. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (many P\u2192P+4 confirmations). Demand regime shift beginning Period 31 (P31-33 avg=113.3 vs prior ~57) persists; recent realized demands (P31\u2013P40) show elevated and more variable demand compared with earliest samples. To reflect confirmed lead time use calculated average of observed lead times. To capture the sustained new demand regime, use recent_N (N=10, Periods 31\u201340) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock and caps to recent higher mean and volatility while avoiding overreaction to single-week spikes. This balances service (protects against stockouts under higher demand) vs holding cost given current healthy on-hand position.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Demand regime shifted up starting Period 31 (sustained higher mean through Period 41). On-hand=285, in-transit=193 (pipeline healthy). Set L to calculate to reflect observed lead-time average (confirmed 4). For demand forecast use recent_N with N=11 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 31\u201341) so mu_hat reflects the higher recent mean; sigma_hat uses recent_N N=11 to capture recent volatility. These choices keep base-stock tuned to the sustained higher demand while acknowledging confirmed lead time and avoiding overreaction to older low-demand periods.

Recent demand (Periods 38-43 = 82,56,60,52,66,45) is lower than the P31-33 spike; use a recent-window forecast to reflect current lower regime. Select recent_N N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to capture the last 6 weeks' mean and volatility so the OR backend sizes base stock to meet near-term demand while avoiding excessive holding given holding cost=$1 vs profit=$19.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-16 (Period 45). Recent history shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods repeatedly; on-hand=184, in-transit=156. Demand in the most recent 6 concluded periods (P39\u2013P44) is moderately elevated/variable (56,60,52,66,45,99) so I bias forecast to the recent window to capture current regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=6 to make the OR engine target inventory for the current higher/volatile demand while avoiding overstating long-run averages. This balances service (avoid stockouts given pipeline) against holding cost ($1/unit) given high profit ($19/unit).

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (Period 46). Supply history shows confirmed lead time = 4 (many concluded arrivals with lead_time=4). Demand shifted up starting Period 31 (Periods 31-33 avg 113.3 vs prior ~57) and has remained elevated through Period 45 (recent demands P31-P45 show sustained higher regime). On-hand=162, in-transit=117; pipeline looks healthy but demand is higher than earlier baseline, so use recent-demand estimates to size base stock and volatility. Set L by calculating observed lead times (confirmed =4). Use recent_N for mu_hat and sigma_hat with N=15 to capture the post-changepoint regime (Periods 31\u201345) for mean and volatility estimation so the OR backend raises target stock to meet higher demand while limiting overstock via caps.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has been in the higher regime that began at Period 31 (avg P31-33=113.3 vs prior ~57) and seasonal year-end demand may reinforce elevated sales. On-hand=115, in-transit=206 (pipeline ample but demand elevated). Lead time has repeatedly been observed as 4 periods; use promised/default L. To capture the sustained demand regime shift, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the recent regime (N=16 periods since Period 31) so the backend forecasts a higher base-stock and accounts for recent volatility while capping order size per its cap logic. This balances higher service (profit >> holding cost) against holding cost.
