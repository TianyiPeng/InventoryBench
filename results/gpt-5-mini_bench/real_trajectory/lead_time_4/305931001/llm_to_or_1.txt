Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11 (Period 1). Historical weekly demand samples average 70 units (samples: 83,62,67,81,57). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0 so no coverage; promised lead time is 4 periods. No evidence of changepoint or missing shipments (only initial period). I select default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This yields a conservative base-stock anchored to historical mean while avoiding premature manual adjustments given no sustained signal and zero pipeline.

No concluded arrivals exist to infer a lead-time change or lost shipment. Historical weekly demand samples (83,62,67,81,57) have mean=70; no recent changepoint detected.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25 (Period 3). Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) have mean=70 units/week and moderate variance (std\u224810.3). On-hand=0, in-transit=178 (two orders of 89) \u2014 no concluded arrivals yet so no evidence actual lead time differs from promised 4. No sustained demand regime change detected. Use default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L), balancing service level vs holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=270 (sum of orders 89+89+92). We have three conclude messages showing no arrivals yet but promised lead time=4 has not been observed/concluded for any order, so actual lead time is still unconfirmed. Demand history (5 weekly samples from early 2019) is limited but shows weekly mean ~70. To avoid overfitting to scarce evidence and because arrivals remain unconcluded, use default/promise-based settings so the OR engine uses promised L and full-sample demand stats: L=default, mu_hat=default, sigma_hat=default. This keeps orders sized to cover (1+L) periods using the full-sample mean/variance and avoids aggressive increases that could raise holding costs while we wait for arrival confirmations.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent on-hand=0, in-transit=360 (sum of past orders). Historical weekly demand samples mean=70, std\u224811.53 (samples: 83,62,67,81,57). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals yet consistent with promised timeline (orders placed in early periods would only be observed arriving in conclude messages at or after Period 6). Pipeline (360) \u2248 5.14 weeks of demand, roughly matching (1+L)=5 review+lead periods demand (5\xd770=350), so no urgent replenishment beyond normal. I choose default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)\xd7mean and sigma scaled by sqrt(1+L), letting the backend balance service level (profit/holding tradeoff) using its analytic formula.

Daily Reward (R_t): $241.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=23, in-transit=275. Concluded history shows Period1 order arrived in Period5 (ordered P1 arrived P5), confirming actual lead time = 4. Demand last 5 periods: [50,83,70,61,66] -> mean=66. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in observed lead time (average of observed lead times = 4). For mu_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime: (1+L)*mean_recent = 5*66 = 330 forecast across review+lead. For sigma_hat I use recent_N N=5 to reflect recent demand variability. These choices ensure the OR backend targets inventory to cover the current 5-period demand profile while explicitly using confirmed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering given prior delayed arrivals.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (order placed Period 1 arrived in Period 5 => observed lead_time=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 7 (2019-03-25). On-hand=61, in-transit=241 (pipeline=302). Historical demand mean from samples = 70 units/week. Two concluded arrivals confirm lead time=4 consistently. I choose L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times (both observed =4). Use mu_hat 'default' so backend sets (1+L)*mean = 5*70=350, matching a 5-period coverage (current period + 4-period lead). Use sigma_hat 'default' so backend uses sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples) to scale observed volatility for the 5-period horizon. This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by targeting the analytic base-stock while relying on confirmed lead-time observations; current pipeline is ample but we keep forecasts conservative to avoid stockouts if in-transit arrivals are delayed or lost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/04/01 (Period 8). Recent concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (orders from P1,P2,P3 arrived after 4 periods). Demand sample mean from provided history = 70 units/week; with promised L\u22484 the (L+1) review horizon implies 5\xd770=350 units demand. Current inventory on-hand (114) + in-transit (202) = 316 units, slightly below the 5-period expected demand, so we should use the confirmed lead-time estimate and standard demand statistics to let the OR backend compute a base-stock that balances $4 profit vs $1 holding cost. Methods chosen: infer L from observed lead times (calculate), use default aggregate demand and volatility (default) so backend uses all samples to compute mu_hat and sigma_hat scaled by (1+L).

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded history shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods (Period 1 order arrived in Period 5) and steady weekly demand drawn from historical samples (mean=70 over provided weeks). Current inventory: on-hand=157, in-transit=143 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=300 units, which covers ~4+1=5 weeks of expected demand (~350 forecast over 5 weeks). I use L=default to rely on the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand forecast I select mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples (leveraging full sample set). For volatility I choose sigma_hat=default to let the OR engine compute sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This balances service level (using full-sample mean with confirmed lead time) against holding cost given substantial existing pipeline; if arrivals or demand show a sustained shift I'll switch to recent_N or explicit in future periods.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). Recent weekly demand (Periods 5-9) ranged ~39\u201366 (recent mean ~49); historical samples (provided) mean ~70. On-hand=116 + in-transit=180 provides ample coverage vs expected (L+1) demand. Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple orders arrived with lead_time=4), so use a data-driven lead time estimate. Choose L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time average; use mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, letting the backend balance service level (via profit/holding tradeoff) against holding cost while respecting the confirmed lead time and avoiding overreaction to short recent variability.

Historical weekly demand mean=70 (samples provided) and lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded history (Period 6 insight). Pipeline + on-hand is healthy vs recent demand; no sustained demand regime shift detected. I choose default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend uses promised L and full-sample statistics ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std). This keeps the base-stock anchored to long-run demand while the confirmed L=4 ensures the backend computes coverage over the correct review+lead horizon and balances service level vs holding cost.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29): recent concluded history shows stable weekly demand around 20\u201383 with no new seasonal spikes; on-hand=173, in-transit=133 (total pipeline=306) which comfortably covers (1+L) periods under promised lead time. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods (Period 6 insight). I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time (default) and rely on the full-sample default demand statistics for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level versus holding cost given healthy inventory and no strong evidence of a recent demand regime shift or lost shipments.

Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent concluded weeks show on-hand=175, in-transit=116 (pipeline total=291). Historical sample mean=70 (from provided Jan samples); confirmed actual lead time=4 in history. Pipeline+on-hand (291) is slightly below the (1+L)*mean baseline (5*70=350) but recent realized weekly demand has been lower (recent concludes: 66,51,39,47,45,29,22,29) with no sustained upward shift. No evidence of lost shipments. Use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand statistics to keep service while avoiding overfitting to short noisy dips.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (Period 5+ arrivals), and steady weekly demand samples (historical samples from Jan-Feb plus recent weekly demands in conclude history). Current inventory: on-hand=184, in-transit=97 (pipeline). Given confirmed lead time matches promised (4), use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std over all samples. This keeps base-stock anchored to long-run mean while the cap limits order size, balancing service level (profit $4 vs hold $1) against holding cost. No overdue shipments currently (in-transit visible) and no new sustained changepoint detected, so defaults are appropriate.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent realized weekly demand has settled well below the historical Jan samples (recent sold series: 66,51,39,47,45,29,22,29,32,35 \u2192 sustained lower regime). On-hand=188 + in-transit=84 provides ample coverage, no overdue/lost shipments signaled; prior concluded messages confirm lead_time=4. To reflect the persistent drop in demand I use a recent-sample demand estimate (captures new regime) while using calculated lead time from observed arrivals for robustness. Selecting recent_N=10 balances recency with sample size; sigma uses the same window to match variability estimate to the regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). On-hand=176, in-transit=62. Confirmed lead time=4 from earlier concludes. Recent demand (Periods 5\u201315) shows a stable lower regime: demands = [66,51,39,47,45,29,22,29,32,35,34], mean=39.0 over 11 periods. I keep L as promised (default=4) consistent with observed confirmations, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=11 to reflect the current lower-demand regime so the OR backend sizes base stock to service (1+L) periods of this recent demand while limiting excess holding cost.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). Recent observed demand (Periods 5\u201316) shows a lower, stable regime vs. early Jan samples: recent demands = [66,51,39,47,45,29,22,29,32,35,34,43], avg \u2248 39. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed in Period 6 and subsequent concludes). To reflect the recent regime, set L by calculation (use observed lead times) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the last 12 demand samples (Periods 5\u201316) so the (1+L) forecast and volatility reflect the current lower mean/variance. This reduces excess holding while preserving service given profit/holding tradeoff (profit $4 vs holding $1).

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). Recent weekly demand samples average ~70 units/week (historical sample mean=70); product is non-seasonal at this date. On-hand=146, in-transit=51 \u2192 pipeline=197 units, which is below (1+L)*mean demand for L=4 (5*70=350) so pipeline alone will not cover the review+lead horizon; use default demand/lead settings so OR backend computes base_stock and cap from full-sample stats. Lead time kept as promised (default) because concluded history consistently shows 4-period arrivals. Using default mu_hat and sigma_hat lets the OR engine apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples to balance service level (profit vs. holding cost) given stable historical data.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 19 (2019-06-17). Recent concluded history (through Period 18) shows on-hand=155 and in-transit=108; actual lead times observed consistently = 4 periods (confirmed in prior carry-over). Historical weekly demand samples (provided) have mean=70 units/week. Given confirmed lead time = promised 4 and no sustained demand regime shift, use default lead time and default demand estimates to let the backend compute base-stock and cap using full-sample statistics. This balances service (covering 1+L weeks at historical mean) against holding cost while avoiding overfitting to short-term noise.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). Recent concluded history shows stable weekly demand around the historical sample mean (~70/week) and confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (recorded previously). Current on-hand=137 + in-transit=128 provides ample pipeline coverage vs expected demand. I use default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(all samples) and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std(all samples). This balances service (uses historical mean) while avoiding excess explicit upward adjustment given no sustained demand surge or additional lost shipments in recent concluced periods.

No sustained demand regime change detected; recent demands have been moderate and stable. I therefore use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend uses all historical samples to compute base_stock, letting it balance service-level vs holding cost given stable history and confirmed LT. This also avoids overreacting to a couple of zero arrivals that correspond to earlier zero orders.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed Period 6) and recent isolated zero arrivals (Periods 19\u201320) are not yet a sustained loss pattern. Use default lead time (promised = 4) and default demand statistics: default mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean(all samples) and default sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)\xd7std(all samples). This keeps the OR backend anchored to the long-run sample mean/variance while acknowledging confirmed L=4; current pipeline is below the (1+L)-period demand implied by the historical mean, so the backend will recommend replenishment to restore coverage.

Recent demand (Periods 19-23) has fallen to a low regime: demands = [18,11,19,16,9], mean \u224814.6. To avoid overstock while preserving service (profit $4 vs holding $1 \u2192 moderate service target), I keep L at the promised/default (4) and set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the recent regime to reflect the lower mean/volatility. Using recent_N=5 captures the latest demand level and variability so the backend computes a smaller base stock and caps orders to reduce holding cost given high on-hand inventory (210) and modest in-transit (43).

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Current on-hand=216, in-transit=30. Recent weekly demand has been low (7\u201319 over the last weeks) but historical sample mean = 70 (samples: 83,62,67,81,57). Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; keep L=default to trust promised lead time. Use mu_hat=default to let backend compute (1+L)*mean from all samples (captures long-run demand baseline). Use sigma_hat=default to let backend compute sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This conservative choice leverages confirmed lead time and historical demand to balance service level vs holding cost given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple orders arriving with W=4), demand has been low-to-moderate (recent weekly sales mostly in the teens\u201340s) and on-hand is high (217) with 31 in-transit. No evidence of a sustained demand regime shift. I therefore use the promised/confirmed lead time and let the OR engine compute forecasted (1+L) demand and volatility from historical samples (default). This keeps ordering conservative given large on-hand stock and avoids excess holding cost while the backend's capped policy limits order sizes.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent sales have declined from earlier peaks; current on-hand=215 and in-transit=17 (total pipeline=232) which is well below the (1+L)-period demand estimate implied by historical mean (5\xd770=350), so we remain exposed to stockouts if demand returns to historical average. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in prior concludes, so I keep L at the promised/default. I select default demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend uses the full historical sample mean/STD scaled by (1+L)=5; this balances service level (by recognizing the 5-period demand window) against holding cost given current high on-hand inventory relative to recent low demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=199, in-transit=17. Concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals (multiple orders with observed lead_time=4), so use inferred lead time. I choose L by 'calculate' (average of observed lead times = 4). For demand I use 'default' mu_hat and 'default' sigma_hat so backend applies (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7historical std (anchors to sample mean\u224870/week), balancing service level against $1 holding cost given $4 profit.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-26 (Period 29). Recent fulfilled demand (Periods 5\u201328) shows a sustained lower-demand regime (~20\u201345/week) versus the historical sample mean (~70). Lead times in concluded messages consistently equal 4 periods. I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time=4. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=20 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (captures the sustained lower demand over many periods), reducing over-ordering relative to the older high-demand samples. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods) against holding costs given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent concluded history (Periods 5\u201329) consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods and stable, moderate weekly demand (historical sample mean = 70/week). Current position: on-hand=168, in-transit=36 (pipeline reasonable vs demand). No evidence of lost shipments or a demand regime shift. I therefore use the promised/default lead time so OR backend uses L=4, and default demand/volatility estimators ((1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) to produce a baseline base-stock that balances the $4 profit vs $1 holding cost.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09 (Period 31). Recent demand has settled lower than early-period spikes: last 5 demands = [16,27,22,15,39] (mean ~23.8) while earlier weeks were often 40-80. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages. I set L=default (use promised 4). For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 to capture the current lower-demand regime and recent volatility, so the OR engine targets (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, reducing excess stocking from earlier high-demand periods and limiting holding cost exposure.

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Current on-hand=94, in-transit=55. Historical arrivals show consistent 4-period actual lead time (confirmed P5\u2013P? arrivals). Demand has shifted down from the Jan seed samples (~70) to a lower, stable recent regime (recent weeks' demands ~30\u201340). To reflect the sustained lower demand regime and limit holding cost while preserving service, I set L by calculating observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 20 demand samples (captures the recent lower-demand regime, N capped at 20). This reduces forecasted (1+L) demand and volatility relative to the full-sample defaults, balancing profit vs holding cost given current healthy on-hand+pipeline.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). History shows consistent observed lead_time=4 (concluded messages), so use promised/default lead time. Historical sample mean = 70 units/week (samples provided), so default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean will target 5*70=350 units to cover review+lead demand; current on-hand+in-transit = 68+30=98, well below that target so the backend will trigger replenishment. No strong recent demand regime change or variance shift detected, so use default sigma_hat to reflect historical variability scaled by sqrt(1+L). These settings balance service level (cover 5 periods of expected demand) against holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=0, in-transit=159. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent lead_time=4 (e.g., Period1 order arrived Period5; repeated across history), so I adopt the observed average lead time. Demand seed samples (provided) have mean=70 units/week; (1+L)=5 \u2192 baseline demand across review+lead \u2248350. In-transit (159) is below the 5-period demand (~350), so we should keep target stock per the baseline to avoid stockouts. I therefore set L to the calculated (observed) lead time and use default mu_hat/sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples) to let the OR engine produce a capped order balancing profit vs holding cost.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent history shows intermittent arrivals with confirmed lead time=4 (recorded earlier). Current on-hand=0, in-transit=244 \u2014 pipeline is substantial but invisible until arrival confirmations. There was a large demand spike in Period 33 causing stockout, but it is a single-to-few period event so not yet a confirmed regime shift. To be conservative and consistent with long-run samples and the promised/observed lead time, use default lead time and demand estimates so the OR backend computes base-stock from the full-sample mean and std. This balances service (covering expected (1+L) demand) while avoiding overreaction to the recent one-off spike given heavy pipeline inventory.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand jumped starting Period 33 (119,78,84,57). On-hand 0 + in-transit 264 \u2248 3.1 periods of demand at the new higher rate, so pipeline does NOT cover (1+L) periods. I set L to default (promised 4) because concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=4 to capture the new higher-demand regime (use last 4 samples) so the OR backend increases target base-stock and safety stock to avoid stockouts while keeping holding cost in mind.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 33: avg increased from 34.6 (Periods 28-32) to 84.5 (Periods 33-36) (+144%)

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28). On-hand=0, in-transit=315. Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 33 (higher weekly demand: Periods 33-37 = 119,78,84,57,85). Promised lead time is 4 and concluded history consistently confirms lead_time=4. I use L=default to keep promised lead time. For demand I use recent_N with N=5 (the post-changepoint regime length) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the new higher mean/volatility; this balances higher service-level needs against holding costs given a large in-transit pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). On-hand=0, in-transit=354. Historical concluded arrivals show actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift beginning Period 33 (recent avg ~84.5). To respect supplier promise and observed confirmations, keep L as promised (default). Forecast demand using the post-shift regime: use recent_N with N=4 (Periods 33-36) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean of last 4 samples, capturing the new higher mean. Use recent_N N=4 for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. These choices prioritize service for the confirmed higher-demand regime while the OR engine will cap orders via its cap rule to limit excess stock given holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/11 (Period 40). Recent demand has shifted upward starting Period 33 (avg ~84.5 over Periods 33-36 vs ~34.6 before); on-hand=15, in-transit=372 (large pipeline). Use promised/default lead time to keep OR backend aligned with supplier promise. For demand sizing, use recent_N over the new high-demand regime (N=4 covering Periods 33-36) so mu_hat reflects the higher mean across review+lead; use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=4) to capture recent volatility. This keeps base_stock responsive to the confirmed higher-demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline will limit immediate orders via the OR cap, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/11/18 (Period 41). Recent demand increased sharply beginning Period 33 (sustained higher regime). On-hand=0, in-transit=407 (sizable pipeline arriving per confirmed LT=4). Use promised/default lead time=4 (confirmed historically). For demand forecast use recent regime data: average over the last 8 post-change samples (Periods 33-40) to capture the new higher mean; likewise use recent std over the same 8 samples to reflect current volatility. These settings steer the OR base-stock toward servicing the higher demand regime while the large in-transit pipeline limits immediate over-ordering.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand regime is the higher regime that began at Period 33 (avg jumped ~+144%); inventory on-hand=34, in-transit=333 (ample pipeline). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (multiple confirmed arrivals at W=4); some earlier gaps exist but recent history is consistent. I set L=calculate to let backend use observed lead times (confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=9) to focus the forecast on the post-changepoint high-demand regime (captures recent 9 weeks of elevated demand). Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=9) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders toward meeting the sustained higher demand while leveraging the large in-transit pipeline to avoid excess ordering.

For demand I use recent_N on the post-changepoint regime to capture the higher mean and current volatility: recent_N N=10 (Periods 33-42) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes base-stock consistent with the new demand level while controlling holding cost given profit/holding ratio.

LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=469 (large pipeline). Historical concludes confirm actual lead_time=4 (observed repeatedly). Demand shifted up at Period 33 and has remained high through Period 44. Choose L=calculate to lock to observed lead times. Use recent_N for demand (N=12 covering Periods 33-44) so mu_hat reflects the new high-demand regime and avoids dilution from earlier low-demand samples. Use recent_N for sigma_hat with same N to capture current volatility. These choices align base-stock to current demand while the large in-transit stock limits additional ordering and reduces holding risk.

Period 46 (2019/12/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas). On-hand=0, in-transit=528. Historical conclude messages show consistent actual lead time = 4 (many orders: order Pn arrived Pn+4). Demand experienced a sustained step-up starting Period 33 (recent regime from P33\u2013P45, length=13) \u2014 higher weekly demand ~80\u2013140 versus ~30\u201350 earlier. To respect confirmed lead time and recent higher-demand regime, set L to calculated (uses observed lead times). Use recent_N (N=13) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend forecasts across (1+L) periods using the post-change regime data and captures recent volatility; this balances higher service requirement now (holiday/seasonal peak) while avoiding excessive overstock because we rely on recent samples and observed in-transit inventory (528) before ordering.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Recent demand has been in the elevated regime (shift at Period 33; recent demands: P33-P46 high, last 5 demands = 191,128,137,137,112). On-hand=0, in-transit=497 \u2014 substantial pipeline but arrivals will only be visible next period. Lead time has been consistently 4 periods in concluded messages, so use observed-average lead time. To reflect the sustained higher-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent data to avoid understocking; N=14 covers the post-changepoint regime (Periods 33\u201346). This balances service (using recent higher mean and volatility) with holding cost by relying on in-transit stock and letting the OR backend cap orders.
