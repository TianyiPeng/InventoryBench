{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 periods (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use L=4.

Demand outlook: recent sustained high-demand regime from Period 32 (avg \u224881.5 units/period) continues through the holiday window (several weeks of 70\u2013191 observed), so plan using a high single-period demand \u224881.5. Coverage requirement: need to cover L+1 = 5 periods of demand \u2248 5\xd781.5 = 407 units. Pipeline (582) comfortably exceeds this. Holding vs stockout tradeoff: profit $4, holding $1 \u2192 critical fractile q=0.8 (z\u22480.84) but extra safety stock is unnecessary because pipeline already > required base-stock.
