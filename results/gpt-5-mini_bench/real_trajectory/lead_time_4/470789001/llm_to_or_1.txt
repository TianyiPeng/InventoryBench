Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Historical weekly demand (5 samples) shows mean ~92.4 units/week and no observed arrivals or lead-time data (on-hand=0, in-transit=0). No sustained changepoint or delayed-shipment evidence. Use promised lead time (default) and default demand estimates based on all samples so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std, balancing service level against holding cost given equal profit and holding cost.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. On-hand=0, in-transit=117 (order placed Period 1 not yet concluded). Promised lead time=4; no concluded arrivals to suggest a different actual lead time. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) appear stable (mean ~92). Use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples, ensuring pipeline + on-hand will be sized for review+lead coverage while avoiding premature changes based on a single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~92.4 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=232; two recent orders (P1,P2) have not concluded, suggesting delays but insufficient periods to confirm a lead-time change. To avoid overfitting to potential lost/delayed shipments, use promised lead time and baseline demand/volatility estimates so the OR backend applies its capped policy with conservative inputs.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=361. Historical demand samples mean=92.4 (5 samples). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time cannot be inferred; outstanding orders are still within the promised 4-period lead. Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility estimators so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps the model anchored to long-run sample stats while awaiting arrival confirmations.

Daily Reward (R_t): $0.00

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11. Recent demand (Periods 1-4 conclude) shows higher activity than the older Jan samples: recent demands = [76,129,108,92], mean=101.25. All orders placed in Periods 1-4 (117,115,129,124) have not concluded by Period 4 (arrived=0) despite promised L=4, indicating lost/extended lead time risk. To be conservative I set L explicit longer than promised to cover delayed arrivals. For demand I use recent_N (N=4) to capture the upshift in the last 4 observed periods. For sigma_hat I use recent_N (N=4) to reflect recent volatility. These choices raise the base-stock target to protect service level given the pipeline uncertainty while leaving the backend to cap order size via its cap rule.

Carry-over insight: Missing shipments: orders placed P1-P4 (117,115,129,124) had arrived=0 by Period 4 conclude => likely lead-time > promised or lost shipments; Recent demand regime: Periods 1-4 mean demand=101.25 (vs earlier mean\u224892.4)

Daily Reward (R_t): $47.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). Recent demand (Periods 1-4) shows a higher regime: mean = (76+129+108+92)/4 = 101.25 units; Period 5 demand=82 is one softer week but not yet a sustained reversal. One concluded arrival (Period 5 conclude: ordered P1 arrived) confirms actual lead time = 4 periods. Current on-hand 35 + in-transit 507 provides ample pipeline but some earlier orders were delayed; using recent demand window preserves responsiveness to the detected uptick while relying on confirmed lead time. Therefore: infer L by averaging observed lead times (calculate), set mu_hat and sigma_hat from the most recent 4 demand observations (recent_N N=4) to target the (1+L)-period demand under the recent regime.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (order placed P1 arrived in P5 conclude -> observed lead_time=4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period start 2019-03-25. On-hand=64, in-transit=392 (total pipeline=456) after two 4-period arrivals confirmed. Recent confirmed actual lead time=4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6). Demand recent samples (Periods1-6): [76,129,108,92,82,86], recent mean=95.5. Pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers (1+L) periods at this demand. Choose L by calculation to reflect observed lead times; choose mu_hat using recent_N (N=6) to capture the most recent demand regime; keep sigma_hat as default to let backend scale volatility over the review+lead period. These choices recognize resolved delayed shipments and keep safety stock aligned to current observed demand while limiting holding given profit=holding cost.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent realized lead times are consistently 4 periods (orders from P1\u2013P3 arrived with W=4). On-hand=90, in-transit=285 => pipeline+on-hand=375 units. Demand history shows moderate volume (recent periods demand: 76,129,108,92,82,86,103) and historical sample mean=92.4. I set L to 'calculate' so backend uses observed lead times (avg=4). I keep mu_hat and sigma_hat as 'default' so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, which balances service level versus holding cost given confirmed L=4 and no new sustained demand regime change.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent realized lead times are consistently 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7, P4->P8). On-hand=106, in-transit=261; pipeline + on-hand covers multiple weeks so no emergency order needed. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. Demand forecast uses recent_N (last 8 weeks) to capture the most recent regime (demands: 76,129,108,92,82,86,103,108) when computing (1+L)*mean. Sigma left as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). These choices align OR base-stock toward observed lead time and recent-demand average, balancing service (profit per unit = holding cost) versus holding risk given ample pipeline inventory.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent history shows actual lead time consistently 4 periods (orders from P1-P5 all observed with lead_time=4). Current inventory: on-hand=178, in-transit=245 (total pipeline=423) which comfortably covers demand over a 5-period horizon. I set L via 'calculate' to lock in the observed lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime (last 5 demand observations show moderate variability and a slightly elevated mean vs earlier Jan samples) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect short-run volatility. These choices keep target base-stock responsive to current demand while avoiding overreaction to older samples and protect against further delayed arrivals.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=112, in-transit=268. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2013P5 arrived with W=4); no evidence of new lost shipments. Recent demand (Periods 1\u201310) averages ~92.4/week; earlier sample set mean=92.4. Use calculated lead time to reflect observed reality and defaults for demand/volatility so backend applies (1+L) scaling on established sample mean/STD. This balances service (confirmed L=4) while avoiding overreacting to short-term variation.

Recent demand has fluctuated but no sustained new regime beyond already-recorded shifts. Set L by averaging observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean of all demand samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std) so forecasts incorporate full history and match the OR engine's assumed review+lead horizon; this balances service vs. holding given profit=holding cost symmetry and substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). Recent demand (last 5 concluded periods 8-12) = [108,67,66,117,65], mean=84.6; on-hand=52, in-transit=351 (pipeline large vs short-term demand). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (orders from P1-P8 arrived after 4 periods), so I use observed lead time. Choose L by calculate to capture confirmed actual lead time. Use mu_hat recent_N (N=5) to base the (1+L)\xd7forecast on the most recent regime (mean=84.6) rather than older samples; this captures the modest downward shift from earlier samples. Use sigma_hat recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These settings keep base_stock aligned to recent demand while the large pipeline reduces urgent replenishment, balancing service level and holding cost.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=90, in-transit=248. Historical concludes consistently show orders arriving with lead_time=4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), confirming actual lead time = 4 and that earlier 'missing' arrivals were due to promised lead_time being met at 4. Demand history (weekly samples provided) shows no new sustained regime shift since confirmation. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (so backend will use observed average = 4). I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples \u2014 conservative pooling of all data is appropriate given no recent sustained demand change. This keeps the base-stock tied to historical average demand across the review+lead period and balances service vs holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1/$1).

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent observed lead times consistently 4 periods (orders from P1..P13 that concluded show lead_time=4). On-hand=25, in-transit=345 gives ample pipeline but demand has moderated recently. Use calculated L to let backend confirm observed LT=4. Demand appears slightly lower than early-sample mean; use recent_N=5 for mu_hat and sigma_hat to focus on the latest regime (last 5 demands: P10-P14 = 66,117,65,85,88) so the OR engine sets base-stock to cover current demand level and variability while avoiding excess holding given high holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-27 (Period 16). History shows actual lead time confirmed at 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals match L=4). Recent demand has risen vs early sample mean (several demands in Periods 9-15 elevated, including Period 15 spike=179). I therefore set L by calculation (uses observed lead times). For demand I use recent_N (N=7, last 7 demand observations covering Periods 9-15) to capture the higher recent regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. For volatility I also use recent_N N=7 to reflect recent demand variability. This balances service (captures recent higher demand) against holding cost by basing base_stock on recent demand statistics rather than full-history average. No explicit adjustment for missing shipments is needed because actual lead time is confirmed as 4.

Period 17 (2019/6/3) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). On-hand=0, in-transit=352. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead_time=4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Recent demand has increased versus earlier Jan samples; using a recent-window demand estimate protects service while avoiding excess holding given high holding cost = profit. Choose L=calculate to reflect observed lead time (average of observed concludes \u22484). Use mu_hat recent_N with N=5 to capture the most recent demand regime ((1+L)=5 review+lead), and sigma_hat recent_N with N=5 to reflect recent demand volatility. This produces a base_stock tuned to current higher demand while the capped order limit prevents excessive ordering into the long pipeline.

Period 18 (2019/6/10) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-10 (Period 18). Recent demand has jumped: Periods 15-17 demands = [179,182,149], indicating a new high-demand regime. On-hand=0, in-transit=545 (pipeline large). Promised lead time = 4 and past concludes consistently show lead_time=4, so use promise. To capture the new regime I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=3 (last 3 periods) so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std on the recent high-demand samples; this raises target base-stock and responsiveness to avoid stockouts given high demand while pipeline is large. L uses default (promised) to keep OR engine aligned with contract lead time and because observed concludes confirm 4. These choices balance service (reduce lost sales from the recent demand surge) against holding cost given substantial in-transit inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 15: avg demand increased from ~101 (Periods 1-4 avg=101.25) to 170 (Periods 15-17 avg=170.0), +68%; sustained for 3 periods (P15-P17).

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:

Current on-hand=4, in-transit=626 (pipeline large). To capture the confirmed lead time I request L by calculation from observed lead times. To adapt demand to the new, higher regime I set mu_hat using recent_N with N=3 (use last 3 demand samples reflecting the ~170 avg). Volatility also set to recent_N N=3 to reflect variability in the new regime. These choices steer the OR base-stock toward meeting the higher recent demand while the large pipeline limits additional ordering.

LLM Rationale:
Period 20 (2019-06-24). On-hand=0, in-transit=690. History shows consistent observed lead_time=4 (orders that concluded list W=4). Demand increased around Periods 15-17 (sustained 3 periods). To protect service while avoiding excess holding (profit=holding), I set lead time to be inferred from observations and base demand on the most recent high-demand regime. Choices: L=calculate to lock in observed LT=4; mu_hat=recent_N with N=3 to forecast using the confirmed elevated regime (Periods 15-17); sigma_hat=recent_N with N=3 to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to cover the (1+L) review+lead horizon under the new demand level while using recent variability for safety.

Period 21 (2019/7/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================

On-hand is 0 with 529 units in-transit (sufficient pipeline for multiple weeks given elevated demand). I set L by calculating observed lead times (reflects confirmed L=4). For demand I use recent_N on the most recent regime (capture elevated mean since Period 15) with N=6 (Periods 15-20). Volatility likewise uses recent_N N=6 to reflect recent variability. These choices ensure the OR backend targets the new higher mean demand while using observed lead time to avoid stockouts or over-ordering under the changed regime.

LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=92, in-transit=514 (pipeline large relative to demand). Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods (consistent arrivals P5 onward). Demand regime elevated since Period 15 (Periods 15-21 show sustained higher demand vs Periods 1-14). To capture the recent higher mean/volatility while respecting confirmed lead time, set L by observed average (calculate). Use recent_N (N=7, covering Periods 15-21) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the base-stock reflects the new higher-demand regime and recent variability; this prioritizes service during sustained elevated demand while avoiding excessive extra inventory beyond the confirmed 4-period lead time and large current pipeline.

Recent demand spike observed around Periods 15-17 (avg \u2248170) but not sustained across enough subsequent periods to declare a new regime. To be conservative and leverage full-sample stability, set L to the calculated observed lead time and use default demand/volatility estimators so the OR backend uses all historical data to compute base_stock; this balances service against holding cost given equal profit and holding ($1 each).

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-07-22 (Period 24). Historical concludes show actual lead time consistently = 4 periods (multiple orders: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, ...). On-hand=266 and in-transit=350 cover several weeks of demand. Recent demand regime uplift (Periods 15-17) was observed but last 5 demand samples (P19-P23 = 147,167,121,73,69) average \u2248115.4; variance remains elevated. To reflect confirmed lead time and recent demand pattern while giving more weight to the most recent weeks, I set L using observed lead times (calculate), use a recent_N mean for mu_hat (N=5) to capture the current demand level, and use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. This balances service (captures elevated recent demand) against holding cost given already-large on-hand + pipeline.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). On-hand=205, in-transit=350. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed in Pn arriving in Pn+4). Recent demand had a temporary spike around P15\u2013P17 but subsequent weeks declined, so no sustained new demand regime. To respect observed lead-time evidence, set L via calculate (average of observed lead times). Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (use all samples) so the OR engine's (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std reflect long-run demand without overreacting to the short spike. This balances service (using confirmed L=4) against holding cost given current large pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=344, in-transit=152. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift around Periods 15-17 (avg rose ~+68%). Given confirmed LT=4, I set L to be inferred from observed lead times to ensure backend uses realized LT. To avoid overreacting to the mid-series demand jump while still letting the OR engine use all data, I use default estimation for mu_hat and sigma_hat ((1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples) so the backend smooths across history and the cap calculation dampens extreme orders. This keeps service high given large on-hand pipeline but limits excess holding cost.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 27 (2019-08-12). Recent history: lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods; recent demand has fallen from the mid-100s/peak in P15-17 to ~60-80 in the last five weeks. On-hand = 420, in-transit = 14, so inventory is ample and we should not inflate demand forecast. Set L based on observed lead times, and use a short recent window (last 5 samples) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the latest lower-demand regime and avoid overstocking.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-19 (Period 28). Recent demand has fallen and stabilized at low levels (Period 23-27 demands = 69,61,59,76,46). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). I set L by calculation to capture observed lead time. Demand forecast uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect the new low-demand regime (most recent 5 weeks). Volatility is also estimated from the same recent window (recent_N N=5) so the OR backend's base_stock and cap use current short-run mean and variance, reducing excess holding while preserving service for near-term demand.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift at Period 23: avg decreased from 170.0 (Periods 15-17) to 62.2 (Periods 23-27), -63.4%; Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (multiple observed P->P+4 arrivals).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent demand regime dropped starting Period 23 (P23-28 demands \u2248 [69,61,59,76,46,98], mean \u224868). On-hand=276 + in-transit=14 = 290 units. Promised L=4 so review+lead horizon = 5 periods. I choose L=default (use promised 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=6) to capture the lower regime (P23-28) so mu_hat = (1+L)*mean(last 6). I also use recent_N (N=6) for sigma_hat to reflect recent volatility. This focuses the backend on the reduced demand regime while remaining responsive to recent variability; current inventory (290) is slightly below 5-period demand at the recent mean (~5*68\u2248340), so the backend may order to rebuild toward the targeted base stock while avoiding unnecessary overstock given the sustained drop since P23.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand=156, in-transit=65. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods; recent demand has been low-to-moderate with no new sustained regime change (recent uptick in P28-29 is only 2 periods). To be conservative and consistent with confirmed lead time and full-sample demand stats, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock from all available samples. This balances service (use confirmed L=4) against holding cost given current healthy on-hand inventory.

Historical conclude messages consistently show observed lead_time=4 (multiple P->P+4 arrivals) and occasional lost/no arrivals but recent pattern confirms LT=4. Recent demand (Periods 26-30 = 76,46,98,120,82) is lower than earlier spikes; use a recent_N demand estimate (N=5) to capture the current regime and reduce overstock risk. Use recent_N for sigma_hat (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. L=set by calculate to reflect observed lead times. These choices keep base_stock aligned with current demand while relying on verified LT to avoid under-ordering given in-transit stock.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). Recent demand has settled into a lower regime since Period 23 (P23-P31 mean \u224872.8). On-hand=44, in-transit=334 (total pipeline=378) \u2014 ample coverage vs. short-term demand. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded messages.

I also set sigma_hat recent_N N=9 to capture recent volatility.

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). Recent demand has dropped sharply since the regime shift noted around Period 23; last 4 demands = [120,82,44,33], recent mean \u2248 69.75. On-hand=11, in-transit=334\u2014pipeline is healthy but demand is now lower, so lower replenishment target recommended. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods historically; use promised/default L=4. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=4) to reflect the new low-demand regime (captures recent mean/volatility over the most recent 4 periods and avoids overstocking). This reduces target base stock and holding costs while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:

On-hand=16 and in-transit=287 provides large pipeline cover; lead-time has been consistently 4 in concluded messages. I set L=calculate to confirm observed lead time from history; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=7 to focus the forecast and volatility on the most recent regime (reduces overstating demand from earlier spike), which balances service level against holding cost given high pipeline inventory.

Period 36 (2019-10-14). On-hand=216, in-transit=36. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift down starting Period 23 (Periods 23-35 demand average ~62; regime length=13). To match current low-demand regime I set L by calculating observed lead times and set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N over the most recent regime (N=13) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)-period demand and volatility from the current low-demand regime, reducing overstock risk while preserving service given confirmed L=4.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has fallen to a low regime (Periods 34-36 demands = 47,36,30; recent 3-period avg=37.7). On-hand=186, in-transit=99 gives ample short-term coverage but demand regime is low so we should size forecast to recent low demand. Lead time has been repeatedly observed as 4 periods in concluded history, so keep promised/default lead time. Set mu_hat using recent_N=3 to capture the new low-demand regime ((1+L)=5 => 5\xd737.7\u2248188.5 implied by backend). Use sigma_hat recent_N=3 to reflect recent low variance. These settings reduce overstock risk while maintaining service given confirmed L=4 and current low demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-10-28 (Period 38). Current on-hand=146, in-transit=95; recent concluded history confirms actual lead time=4 periods and no new widespread lost-shipment pattern. Recent demand has been in a lower regime (last 7 concluded demands: P31-P37 = 44,33,46,47,36,30,44; mean \u2248 40). To reflect the sustained lower-demand regime and keep inventory aligned with service/holding cost tradeoff (profit=holding \u2192 critical service quantile 0.5), I use promised/default L and estimate demand over the recent regime using recent_N=7 for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std. This reduces excess safety stock carried from prior high-demand periods while preserving service given confirmed 4-period lead time.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). Lead time history shows consistent 4-period arrivals (multiple conclude messages P->P+4). Recent demand has fallen to a lower regime: last 5 concluded demands (P34-P38) = [47,36,30,44,34], avg \u2248 38.2, much lower than earlier regimes. On-hand=144, in-transit=63 (pipeline covers several weeks). To reflect confirmed lead time I use calculate (avg observed =4). To align mu_hat and sigma_hat with the new low-demand regime I use recent_N with N=5 (captures P34-P38 recent pattern). This reduces target base-stock and lowers holding cost while maintaining service for expected demand over review+lead.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). On-hand=115, in-transit=63. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals); earlier missing arrivals were resolved and no new sustained delivery failures observed. Recent demand has been low (last 6 demands: 36,30,44,34,29,? trending ~36), so we avoid overstating demand. I select default lead time (use promised L=4) and default demand stats (use all samples for (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). Using defaults leverages the full historical sample set and the confirmed LT=4 so the backend's base-stock will balance service vs holding without overreacting to short-term noise or resolved shipment issues.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-18 (Period 41). Recent demand has been low and stable since the large decline noted around Period 23; last 7 observed weekly demands (P34-P40) = [47,36,30,44,34,29,37], indicating a lower-demand regime. Lead times have repeatedly concluded as 4 periods (multiple P -> P+4 arrivals), so use observed average lead time. To keep the forecast responsive to the sustained lower regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 7 samples (captures current mean/volatility while meeting the recent_N rules). These choices reduce overstock risk versus using all-sample averages while preserving service given confirmed L=4.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals). Current on-hand=93 + in-transit=152 => pipeline=245 units, which comfortably covers (1+L) periods at recent low demand. Demand has been in a lower regime since about Period 28 (sustained low weekly sales ~30-60). To reflect the confirmed lead time and recent low-demand regime, set L using observed lead times, and set mu_hat and sigma_hat based on the most recent regime (to avoid inflating targets from earlier high-demand spikes). This reduces overstock risk while maintaining service given observed lead time.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 43 (2019-12-02). Historical lead time repeatedly confirmed as 4 periods; I keep L as promised. On-hand 2 + in-transit 167 = 169 units in pipeline. Recent demand has fallen from earlier spikes; last 5 concluded demands (Periods 38-42) = [34,29,37,48,91], recent mean \u224847.8. (1+L)=5 so (1+L)*mean \u2248239 \u2014 pipeline is currently below a 5-period forecast but recent demand level is much lower than the mid-year spike. I set L=default to use the promised (and confirmed) 4-period lead time, mu_hat=recent_N with N=5 to base the 5-period demand forecast on the most recent regime, and sigma_hat=recent_N with N=5 to capture recent volatility. This balances service level against holding cost by using the current low-demand regime rather than the earlier high-demand spikes.

Historical concludes consistently show actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple P->P+4 arrivals), and there were past missing arrivals but lead time has been repeatedly confirmed as 4. Recent demand has fallen from mid-year peaks and recent weeks (P40-P43) show demands 37,48,91,59 with some volatility; no new sustained regime shift (need 3+ consistent periods) since prior insights. I set L using calculate to reflect the observed average lead time (confirmed \u22484). I use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the backend computes (1+L)\xd7historical mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std across all samples\u2014this balances service level against holding cost given lead-time confirmation and mixed demand history.
