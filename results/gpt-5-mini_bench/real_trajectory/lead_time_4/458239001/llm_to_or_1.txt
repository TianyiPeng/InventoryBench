Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent weekly demand samples: [48,47,38,61,67], mean=52.2, std\u224811.9. On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals exist to infer actual lead time. Promised lead time is 4 and there is no sustained changepoint in demand (only 5 samples). Given lack of concluded lead-time evidence and limited data, use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This keeps forecasting simple while the system gathers arrival feedback; high profit/low holding (profit=19, holding=1) implies a high service target, which the backend will reflect when computing base_stock.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18 (Period 2). Recent actual demand observed: Period1 demand=62; historical weekly samples = [48,47,38,61,67] (mean \u224852.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=72 (ordered in Period1, not concluded). Promised lead time=4 and no concluded arrivals exist to infer a different lead time or lost shipment pattern (need \u22653 periods of consistent evidence). I therefore keep L at default (promised) and use default demand estimates (no recent sustained changepoint): mu_hat and sigma_hat set to default so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std using all available samples. This balances service level (covering L+1 periods) while avoiding overreaction to a single high demand period or a single delayed arrival.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 3 (2019-02-25). Historical weekly demand samples (5 weeks) have mean 52.2 units/week. Two concluded periods show ordered arrivals=0 (Period 1 and 2), so no confirmed lead-time observation; cannot infer actual lead time or declare shipments lost. Use default/promised lead time (4) and default demand estimates so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from full sample set. This is conservative: with mu_hat based on all samples (\u2248261 units for 5-period coverage) and in-transit=145, the backend will place replenishment to cover the remaining coverage gap while accounting for profit/holding tradeoff.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/4. Historical weekly demand samples (Jan\u2013Feb) mean=52.2 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=221 (from orders in P1\u2013P3); no concluded arrivals in history so no evidence lead time differs from promised 4. Using promised lead time to let OR engine apply (1+L) demand scaling: expected demand over review+lead = 5\xd7mean. Chosen default methods keep baseline forecast and variance from full sample while allowing OR backend cap to limit order quantity given current pipeline and service/holding tradeoff.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). Historical weekly demand samples available: 48,47,38,61,67 (mean ~52.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=302 (sum of prior orders 72+73+76+81). No concluded arrivals in history so actual lead time cannot be inferred; shipments are in-transit but not yet concluded. Use promised lead time and default demand statistics to let the OR engine apply its base-stock calculation while not over-interpreting missing concludes. Methods chosen: L=default to respect the promised 4-period lead time (no confirmed deviation); mu_hat=default to use (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples for a stable demand forecast; sigma_hat=default to use sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples so the backend captures observed variability. This balances service level (using full-sample mean) against holding cost and avoids overreacting to unconfirmed shipment delays.

Daily Reward (R_t): $1368.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Current date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=0, in-transit=269. Concluded arrival evidence: Period 5 shows arrived=72 (ordered P1) with lead_time=4 \u2014 actual lead time confirmed at promised 4. Recent realized demand (Periods 1-5) averages 69.8 units/week, materially above the older historical sample mean (52.2), indicating a sustained higher-demand regime over the last 5 periods. To target service while controlling holding cost, keep L as promised (default) and set demand estimates from the recent 5-period regime: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend sizes base-stock to cover the higher current demand across review+lead. This also accounts for existing in-transit stock (269) when computing order quantity.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (P1 order arrived in P5); Demand regime shift: avg increased from 52.2 (older samples) to 69.8 (Periods 1-5) = +33.6%

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. On-hand=0, in-transit=278 (large pipeline). Periods 1-5 show a sustained higher-demand regime (avg 69.8/week vs prior ~52.2). Periods 1-2 orders confirmed lead time = 4 (arrivals observed at P5 and P6). I therefore trust lead time=4 and use the recent 5-week demand regime to size (1+L) demand. Chosen methods: L by calculation of observed lead times to keep aligned with confirmations; mu_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime (5-week mean \u224869.8 \u2192 (1+4)*mean \u2248349 units target); sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to reflect volatility in the same recent regime. This keeps the base-stock tuned to the confirmed lead time and recent higher demand while avoiding overreacting to older low-demand samples; large in-transit reduces ordering needs but the backend will cap orders accordingly.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. On-hand=0, in-transit=291 (several 4-period arrivals recently confirmed). Historical concluded arrivals show consistent actual lead time=4. Demand has shifted upward vs older 2019 samples; recent 5-period mean is substantially higher and reflects current regime. To protect service while limiting holding cost I use confirmed lead time (calculate) and base demand estimates on the most recent 5 demand observations (recent_N N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets the new higher regime and the capped order prevents over-ordering from transient spikes.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-08. Demand has accelerated sharply over the last 5 periods (recent demands: 63,78,86,94,109) vs earlier; observed lead times from concluded messages are consistently 4 periods. On-hand=0, in-transit=309 (covers multiple periods). I set L to 'calculate' to lock in the empirically observed 4-period lead time. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the new higher-demand regime (backing heavier replenishment over the (1+L) horizon). Sigma uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent volatility. These choices bias orders upward to avoid stockouts given sustained demand rise while relying on in-transit inventory to limit excess holding.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=0, in-transit=385. Concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P5 arrived after 4 periods) and a sustained demand regime shift: recent 5-period mean demand = 69.8 (Periods 1\u20135). Pipeline (385) comfortably covers (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 69.8 \u2248 349 units. Therefore set L by calculating observed lead times, and use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to reflect the confirmed higher-demand regime while avoiding overreaction to older samples. This balances service level (higher mu to meet stronger demand) against holding cost given ample in-transit inventory.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-22. Recent demand (Periods 1-5) shows a sustained upward regime: avg = 69.8 vs historical 52.2 (+33.6%). On-hand=0, in-transit=415 (covers many future periods). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages. To reflect confirmed LT and recent demand regime, set L to calculate (use observed average LT). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to target the new higher-demand regime based on the last 5 demand samples. This avoids relying on older low-demand data while the large in-transit pipeline reduces urgency for extra safety stock.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-29 (Period 12). Demand has shown a sustained higher regime: Periods 1-5 in-game demand mean = 69.8 units (vs older sample mean 52.2). On-hand=0, in-transit=428 (ample pipeline but arrival confirmations show actual lead time=4). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times (confirming 4). For demand forecast I use the most recent 5-period regime (recent_N N=5) to capture the higher mean across the review+lead horizon. sigma_hat uses recent_N N=5 to reflect current volatility. These choices steer the OR engine toward a base-stock sized for the new, higher demand while using observed lead-time evidence to avoid underordering or overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/5/6. Recent demand has risen and become more variable (last 5 demands: 109,54,97,118,74; mean=90.4). On-hand=25, in-transit=464; confirmed lead time history shows arrivals at 4 periods. I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period behavior. For demand forecast I use a recent_N (N=5) to capture the higher recent mean; mu_hat will therefore reflect (1+L)*mean of the last 5 weeks, helping the OR backend target service during this elevated-demand regime while avoiding excessive safety stock. Sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to reflect increased recent volatility for proper safety buffer calibration.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-05-13 (Period 14). On-hand=104, in-transit=409. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple P arrivals at 4). Demand has shifted up vs. older samples: recent 5-period mean = 69.8 (Periods 1-5) vs older mean 52.2 (+33.6%) and this higher regime persisted through recent periods (repeated stockouts then larger receipts). No evidence of lost shipments now; pipeline (409) plus on-hand (104) provides coverage but we should size targets to the higher recent demand. Therefore use promised lead time (default = 4) and set demand estimates using the recent-5 regime to capture the sustained higher mean and volatility. This increases base-stock to reduce stockouts while holding cost is low relative to profit (profit=19 vs holding=1).

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). On-hand 166, in-transit 297. Historical concluded lead times consistently 4 periods (strong evidence), so use calculated lead time. Recent demand is elevated vs older samples; using recent_N (last 5 demand periods) captures current regime and keeps safety tailored to recent volatility. sigma_hat also set to recent_N (N=5) to reflect recent variability. These choices keep base-stock aligned to observed 4-period lead time and higher recent demand, balancing service level (higher mu_hat) against holding cost.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent concluded history shows consistent actual lead time = 4 (confirmed P1->P5, P2->P6, etc.). On-hand=215, in-transit=231 (healthy pipeline) but demand has shown a higher regime vs older samples; last 5 demand observations (Periods 11-15 = 118,74,36,50,53) give a recent mean \u224866.2. To reflect confirmed lead time and recent demand regime while limiting holding cost, I use promised lead time (default) and set demand estimates based on the most recent 5 periods (recent_N N=5) for both mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend targets service appropriate to current variability while capping orders via its cap rule.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-06-03 (Period 17). On-hand=264, in-transit=99; no recent lost shipments\u2014arrivals have consistently shown lead time=4. Recent demand (Periods 12-16 = 74,36,50,53,86) indicates a moderately elevated but variable regime vs older samples. I keep L as default (promised 4) since concluded history confirms 4. For demand I use recent_N (N=5) to capture the most recent regime while avoiding stale older data. Sigma kept default (uses all samples scaled by sqrt(1+L)) to provide conservative safety given demand variability. These choices bias the OR engine toward a service level aligned with recent demand while avoiding excessive overstock given high current on-hand inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 18 (2019-06-10). On-hand=228, in-transit=58. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time=4 periods and recent demand has been well above the old 52/week baseline (sustained higher weekly demand since Periods 1+). To reflect sustained higher demand and emphasize service (profit $19 vs holding $1), I use promised/default lead time and tighten forecast to recent data: L set to default (promised 4), mu_hat set using recent_N to emphasize the last 10 demand observations, and sigma_hat left as default to use full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This balances higher target fill rates (higher q) against holding cost while accounting for observed higher demand and existing pipeline.

Period 19 (2019/6/17) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/6/17. Recent demand elevated vs. historical (previous carry-over: +33.6% regime shift). On-hand=139, in-transit=173; one recent order (Period 18) showed arrived=0 but prior history strongly confirms lead time=4, so keep promised L. To respect the confirmed higher-demand regime, I use recent_N over the last 5 demand samples (captures current demand ~75 units/week) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine raises base-stock and caps to sustain service while limiting excess holding given holding cost=$1/unit. L uses default (promised) because multiple concluded arrivals show actual lead time=4 and single non-arrival is not yet sustained evidence of loss.

Recent demand (Periods 15-19) = [53,86,96,89,186], indicating a higher regime; I use recent_N=5 to capture current mean/volatility. Keeping lead time set by observed history (calculate). This raises target base-stock to cover (1+L) periods of elevated demand while sigma uses recent volatility to size safety stock; this balances high profit (q\u22480.95) against holding cost given large in-transit but zero on-hand.

Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead time = 4 periods when shipments arrive; some recent orders were lost/zero arrival but lead-time when observed remains 4. Recent demand has jumped (last 5 demands: 86,96,89,186,232) suggesting a new higher-demand regime; to be responsive while controlling holding cost, I set L based on observed lead times and use a short recent window (5 periods) for demand mean and volatility so the base-stock adapts quickly to the surge but is not overly driven by a single period.

Concluded history shows consistent 4-period arrivals for concluded shipments; recent demand has been much higher than the original 5-sample baseline (last 5 concluded demands: 89,186,232,108,76; mean=138.2). To capture the recent elevated regime I set L by calculating observed lead times (confirming 4). I set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N=5 to base the (1+L)-period demand forecast and volatility on the latest 5 demand observations so the OR backend increases target stock for higher recent demand while keeping holding cost in mind.

Demand has shown elevated regime vs older base (carry-over note) but recent weeks are volatile; given strong evidence for LT=4 and to let the OR engine use full sample history for stability, I select default lead time and default demand moments so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This balances service level (high profit driving high fill target) against significant existing pipeline to avoid unnecessary new orders.

Period 25 (2019/7/29) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 25 (2019-07-29). Recent demand is elevated and volatile (last 5 demands: 232,108,76,58,94; avg=113.6) and prior analysis confirmed lead time = 4. On-hand 182 + in-transit 606 = 788 units, which already covers multiple (1+L)=5 periods at recent demand levels, so avoid inflating long-run stock. Set L by calculate to lock in observed LT=4. Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to make the forecast responsive to the recent high/volatile regime while letting the OR engine cap ordering given the large pipeline.

Period 26 (2019/8/5) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-05 (Period 26). On-hand=362, in-transit=391. Historical concludes show consistent actual lead time = 4 (orders placed Pn arriving Pn+4). Demand has shifted up vs. older baseline; recent 5-period demand (Periods 21-25 = 108,76,58,94,69) average ~81, showing a sustained higher regime than earliest samples. To reflect confirmed lead time and elevated recent demand, set L by calculation (uses observed lead times=4). Use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat to forecast (1+L)-period demand from the latest regime and recent_N N=5 for sigma_hat to capture recent volatility. This increases target base-stock to preserve service during the 4-period lead while avoiding excess inventory from older low-demand samples.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/12 (Period 27). Recent weekly demand is volatile but average over last 5 concluded periods (P22-26 demands = 76,58,94,69,27 \u2192 mean=64.8) is a reasonable short-term forecast. On-hand=582 + in-transit=144 = 726 units, which comfortably exceeds five-period demand (L+1)\xd7mean \u2248 5\xd764.8=324, so no aggressive replenishment is needed. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded history; use default promised L. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N (N=5) to capture the latest regime and volatility and avoid overreacting to older data. These choices keep target base-stock aligned to recent demand while the large existing pipeline limits new orders, minimizing holding cost risk.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent weekly demand has fallen from the earlier high regime; last 5 demands = [58,94,69,27,18], mean=53.2. On-hand=674, in-transit=34 \u2014 ample cover versus short-run demand, no new lost-shipment signal. Use promised lead time (default=4). For demand forecast use recent_N (N=5) to reflect the clear recent downshift. Use recent_N (N=5) for sigma to capture recent volatility. These choices reduce excess ordering relative to the earlier high-demand regime while accounting for observed variability.

Date 2019-08-26. Recent realized weekly demand has dropped (Periods 25-28: 69,27,18,17) versus earlier elevated regime; on-hand=657, in-transit=34 (high coverage). Lead time historically confirmed as 4. To avoid excess stocking given high on-hand and recent low demand, use EWMA for mu_hat (gamma=0.3) to weight recent low demand more while retaining some memory of prior regime. Keep L as default (promised 4) and sigma_hat default to reflect historical variability scaled by (1+L).

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-02 (Period 30). On-hand = 664, in-transit = 0. Historical early samples showed a higher regime (carry-over insight) but the most recent 5 demand observations (Periods 25-29 = 69,27,18,17,27) show a much lower recent mean (~31.6/week). Promised and observed lead time = 4 periods; use default lead time. To avoid excess ordering given very high on-hand and low recent demand, set demand forecast using recent_N (last 5) so mu_hat = (1+L)\xd7mean of recent demand, and set sigma_hat using recent_N to capture recent low volatility. This reduces ordering aggressively vs older high-demand regime and mitigates holding cost while preserving service for short lead time.

Period 31 (2019/9/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-09-09. On-hand=658, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 periods and a sustained demand regime shift (avg through early periods increased ~+33%). To respect confirmed LT evidence and higher recent demand, set L via calculated average of observed lead times and center demand forecast on the most recent regime: use recent_N (N=5) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine builds base-stock for (1+L) periods using the latest higher-mean, higher-volatility samples. This reduces stockouts from the elevated demand while avoiding excessive extra inventory beyond the recent regime estimate.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/9/23 (Period 33). On-hand=628, in-transit=0; no arrivals visible in last periods -> no outstanding pipeline. Recent demand has fallen sharply: Periods 28-32 demands = [17,27,6,16,14] (avg=16.0). Prior carry-over confirmed lead time = 4. I set L=default to use promised lead time (4) consistent with confirmed observation. For mu_hat and sigma_hat I use recent_N with N=5 (the last 5 periods) to capture the new low-demand regime and reduced volatility, so the OR engine will target a much lower base stock and avoid excess holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 28: avg decreased to 16.0 (Periods 28-32) from prior 69.8 (Periods 1-5) = -77.1%

Lead time historically observed = 4 periods (multiple confirmed arrivals). I set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead time=4. For demand I use recent_N with N=7 (the recent low-demand regime length, Periods 28-34) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect current low demand rather than older high-demand data; this keeps orders small to avoid holding cost given large on-hand and zero in-transit.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). On-hand=555, in-transit=0. Historical concluded messages confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 28 (Periods 28-36 average demand ~16 vs prior ~69.8). No recent arrivals \u2192 no pipeline. To avoid overstocking while preserving service, use promised/confirmed L and set demand forecast from the low-demand regime. Set L=default (promised 4). Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=9 (Periods 28-36) so the OR engine computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the recent low-demand regime, reducing future orders to match the sustained lower demand.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 38 (2019-10-28): on-hand=543, in-transit=0. Recent sustained demand drop starting Period 28 (carry-over: avg \u224816 over P28-32, and low demands through P37). Lead time previously confirmed as 4 but promised is 4; keep default. To avoid overstock replenishment given large on-hand and the sustained low-demand regime, set demand forecast and volatility from the recent regime (last 10 periods). Methods chosen: L=default to use promised lead time; mu_hat=recent_N (N=10) to scale (1+L)\xd7mean of the most recent 10 demand samples capturing the low-demand regime; sigma_hat=recent_N (N=10) to reflect recent volatility. These params will steer OR to order conservatively, reducing holding cost while maintaining service against recent demand.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-04 (Period 39). On-hand=527, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period 6 insight) and a sustained demand regime drop starting Period 28: recent demand has averaged ~16 per week (Periods 28-38). To avoid overstock while meeting low current demand, set L to calculated (use observed lead times), and compute demand forecast and volatility from the recent low-demand regime using the last 11 periods (Periods 28-38). This biases mu_hat and sigma_hat to the current low regime, reducing unnecessary ordering and holding cost while preserving service under the confirmed lead time.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-11 (Period 40). On-hand=514, in-transit=0. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time = 4 and a sustained demand regime shift down beginning Period 28 (recent weekly demands ~16 units). To avoid overstocking given high on-hand and lower recent demand, set lead time to promised (use default) and forecast using recent regime (Periods 28-39, 12 samples) so mu_hat and sigma_hat reflect the lower mean and variability (N=12). This reduces target base-stock and caps replenishment to limit holding cost while preserving service for current low-demand regime.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=490, in-transit=0. Historical data shows a sustained low-demand regime starting Period 28 (avg \u224816) that persists through current periods; lead time was previously confirmed as 4. To avoid over-ordering given large on-hand and the sustained lower demand, keep promised lead time and base forecasts on the recent low-demand regime (use recent_N over the last 13 periods, Periods 28-40). This reduces (1+L) demand forecast and variability, lowering orders and holding cost while preserving service for current low demand.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). Recent demand has been in the low regime since Period 28 (avg ~16/week); on-hand = 480, in-transit = 0 so inventory is ample. No new lead-time evidence (previously confirmed L=4). To avoid overstocking while reflecting the sustained low-demand regime, keep L as promised (default) and set demand estimates based on the recent low-demand regime. Selected mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 (covers Periods 28-41, regime length 14) so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, reducing orders relative to historical highs.

To avoid overstock while meeting service, keep promised lead time (default) and base demand forecast on the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=15 (covers Periods 28\u201342) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, reducing unnecessary ordering given current high on-hand balance.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/12/9 (Period 44). Lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods (Period 6 conclude). Demand dropped sharply starting Period 28 (carry-over: avg ~16 over Periods 28-32). Current on-hand = 366 and in-transit = 0. I set L to default (promised 4) since lead time is confirmed. For demand I use recent_N with N=16 (Periods 28\u201343 regime length = 16) to capture the low-demand regime when computing (1+L)\xd7mean. Sigma set to recent_N N=16 to reflect recent volatility. These choices keep target stock aligned to the sustained lower-demand regime and avoid excess future holding cost while preserving service with current high on-hand.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=350, in-transit=0. Historical lead times observed consistently = 4 (confirmed in Period 6). Demand dropped sharply from ~70 to ~16 starting Period 28, but recent weeks show a short-lived holiday spike (two 57s in Periods 42-43). To avoid over-ordering given large on-hand stock and possible transient spike, set lead time by calculation (uses observed lead times). Forecast (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) use recent_N=5 (captures the latest demand regime including the holiday spike) so the OR engine targets an order-up-to appropriate for current short-run demand while avoiding unnecessary replenishment.

LLM Rationale:

No recent sustained lead-time changes; actual lead time previously confirmed as 4. With high on-hand inventory covering many weeks of current low demand, I choose conservative defaults so the OR engine (which uses promised L=4) will compute order quantities from its historical demand moments and avoid new replenishment driven by transient spikes. Methods: use default lead time and default demand moments to let backend's statistical base-stock calculation decide small/zero orders.

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-30 (Period 47). On-hand=321, in-transit=124. Historical concluded arrivals confirm lead time = 4 (recorded earlier); recent demand shows volatility with two Nov spikes but not a sustained shift (fewer than 3 consecutive periods), so no new regime recorded. Inventory (321+124=445) comfortably covers several (1+L) periods at historical averages, so use default statistical estimates to let the OR engine compute base-stock while avoiding manual overreaction to recent short-lived spikes.
