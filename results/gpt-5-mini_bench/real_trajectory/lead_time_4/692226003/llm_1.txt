The last three weeks average \u2248135 units/week, indicating current demand ~135/wk (no sustained abrupt regime shift requiring special adjustment). c) Lead time / pipeline: Promised lead time =4 periods. No concluded arrivals exist yet, so cannot confirm actual lead time or lost orders. d) Inventory: On-hand 0, in-transit 0.

Lead time / arrivals: no in-transit and historical concludes confirm supplier actual lead time = 4 periods; no recent arrivals outstanding. Inventory & pipeline: on-hand = 115, in-transit = 0. Expected demand over the next (L+1)=5 periods if current low regime persists \u2248 7\xd75 = 35 units; even if demand temporarily doubles (conservative stress), 5-period need \u2264 70. Holding cost = $1/unit/period; profit = $19/unit sold. Ordering risks: ordering now would arrive too late for immediate weeks and increases holding cost and risk of markdowns into new year. Final decision: do not place an order this period to avoid unnecessary holding cost; existing inventory comfortably covers several weeks of expected demand.",
