Given high profit-to-cost ratio (q=0.95) OR targets a high service level, but we lack evidence of sustained demand increase (only one high demand observation of 206 in P1). Risks: placing a very large order now exposes us to holding cost and to potential lost orders if supplier issues occur; conversely under-ordering risks stockouts. Decision: follow the OR recommendation of 234 units. This keeps pipeline+order \u2248459, which is conservative relative to the aggressive base-stock target but consistent with the OR cap and current uncertainty about lead-time/shipments.
