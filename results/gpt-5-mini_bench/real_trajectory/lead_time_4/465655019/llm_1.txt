Decision needs to cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (current period demand occurs after decision). Forecast: use short-term average \u224872 units/period \u2192 5-period coverage \u2248360 units. Inventory position: on-hand=0, in-transit=270 \u2192 implied shortfall \u224890 units. Trade-off: profit = $1, holding = $1 per unit/period (high holding cost equal to profit) so avoid large excess. Order size: satisfy expected shortfall but remain conservative given high holding cost and post-holiday uncertainty. Recommend ordering 80 units (small buffer below full shortfall).",
