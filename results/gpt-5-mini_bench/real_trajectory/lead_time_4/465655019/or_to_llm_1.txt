Current on-hand=0, in-transit=194 (these will arrive across upcoming periods but pipeline visible only after conclude). Demand outlook: Recent periods show a sustained high-demand regime since Period 14 with fluctuations; most recent 5 periods (P41\u2013P45) demands = [27,159,50,39,119], mean \u2248 78.8/week. Calendar: Date is 2019-12-23 (week before Christmas) \u2014 elevated demand likely to persist this week. Coverage target: with lead time L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand because demand in current period occurs after decision. Target stock = 5 \xd7 78.8 \u2248 395 units. Pipeline + on-hand = 194 + 0 = 194, so order_raw \u2248 395 \u2212 194 = 201. OR recommended 109 (uses long-run historical mean and promised L) \u2014 I increase because recent observed demand is much higher and pipeline only covers ~2.5 periods. Holding cost = profit, so avoid large overorders; round to a conservative integer close to needed coverage. Final action: order 200 units to bring expected available units near 394\u2013395, covering the next 5 periods under elevated demand while limiting excess holding cost risk.",
