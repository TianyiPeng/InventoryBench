Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. SKU 253448001: on-hand=0, in-transit=0, no concluded arrivals or evidence of lead-time change. Historical samples (Jan 2019) show no sustained regime shift and no calendar spike visible. Use promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations so the OR backend computes (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level and holding cost given no new information.

Period 2 (2019/2/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-18. Recent observed weekly demand samples average 56 units (samples: 51,39,58,70,62). On-hand=0, in-transit=76 from Period 1 order (arrived=0 in Period 1 conclude) \u2014 cannot infer a lost shipment or shorter lead time yet. I use default lead time (promised L=4) because no concluded arrivals establish actual lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to default (use all samples) so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std; this balances service level using historical mean while avoiding premature regime shifts given limited evidence. The current pipeline (76) is well below (1+L)\xd7mean demand, so the backend will likely order to refill toward the calculated base stock.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand samples (51,39,58,70,62) give mean=56. Promised lead time is 4 periods; no concluded arrivals yet beyond normal promise (orders placed P1,P2 have arrived=0 but not overdue). No sustained demand or lead-time shift detected. Use defaults so backend applies (1+L)*mean demand and sqrt(1+L)*std to set base stock, balancing service level vs holding cost.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=237 (sum of prior orders 76+81+80). No concluded arrivals in history so actual lead time cannot be inferred; shipments are not yet overdue relative to promised L=4. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01) mean=56, std ~10. Use default promised lead time and default demand aggregation so backend computes mu_hat = (1+L)*mean and sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std. This keeps a conservative service-level (profit/ (profit+holding)=0.8) while avoiding premature adjustments for unconfirmed lead-time or demand regime changes.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-11 (Period 5). On-hand=0, in-transit=313. Historical weekly demand samples (provided) average 56 units/week. Promised lead time is 4 periods and there are no concluded arrivals yet (period conclues show arrived=0), so no confirmed change in actual lead time. In-transit (313) already covers the (1+L)-period demand implied by the historical mean (5\xd756=280), so keep conservative defaults: use promised lead time and default demand/volatility calculations based on all samples. This avoids over-ordering given holding cost while providing service coverage for the review+lead horizon.

Daily Reward (R_t): $99.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/18. Recent concluded history shows one order (Period 1) arrived in Period 5 with lead_time=4, matching the promised lead time. On-hand=41 and in-transit=237 (total pipeline=278) roughly covers the (1+L)-period demand. Historical weekly demand samples (51,39,58,70,62) have mean=56; with L=4 the default (1+L)*mean = 280 units. I therefore set L to be calculated from observed lead times (will confirm if more observations arrive), and use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend computes (1+L)-period mean and scaled std from all samples. This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1 implies moderate service target) while avoiding overreaction to a single arrival event.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (observed: Period 1 order arrived Period 5, lead_time=4)

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-25. Historical weekly demand samples (given) mean=56; recent observed demands in concluded periods show a downward drift but not yet 3+ sustained periods to declare a regime change. On-hand=95, in-transit=174 provides ample pipeline for a 4-period lead time ((1+L)=5). Lead time observed twice as 4; use calculated lead time to let backend confirm average. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and \u221a(1+L)\xd7std from full sample set, balancing service level vs holding cost given limited evidence of a persistent demand shift.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01. Recent on-hand=138, in-transit=112 (total pipeline 250). Recent realized demands (Periods 5-7): 35, 27, 37 -> recent mean=33.0, noticeably below historical sample mean (56). Observed arrivals show consistent lead times of 4 periods (P1->P5, P2->P6, P3->P7). Pipeline + on-hand currently covers ~7.6 periods at recent demand rates, so no aggressive replenishment needed. Set L using calculated average of observed lead times to reflect confirmed LT=4. Use recent_N (N=3) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to adapt to the newer, lower demand regime (3-period sustained shift). These parameters will lower the base-stock target to reduce holding costs while maintaining service given the confirmed lead time and ample pipeline.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/4/8. On-hand=159 + in-transit=36 -> healthy pipeline; lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history (Period 6). No sustained demand regime change observed from recent weeks (demands: 35,27,37,55) versus prior samples, so use defaults: L=promised (4), mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from full sample history to let OR backend apply its base-stock formula.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-15 (Period 10). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 (Period 1 order arrived Period 5). Current inventory: on-hand 119 + in-transit 112 = 231 units. Demand history shows weekly demand in the historical samples and recent periods consistent with past mean; no sustained upward/downward regime detected. Given confirmed lead time and stable demand, use default lead time and default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies its (1+L) scaling and standard deviation pooling. This keeps the base-stock calculation aligned with observed lead time while avoiding overreacting to short-term noise, balancing service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) against holding costs.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). Recent demand samples (historical weekly data) show mean demand = 56 units/week. On-hand=97, in-transit=140 (pipeline ample to cover upcoming weeks). Lead time was confirmed as 4 periods in history (Period 5 conclude). No sustained demand regime change detected. To keep the OR backend aligned with promised/observed lead time and historical demand, I select default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std. This yields a conservative base-stock reflecting the 5-week coverage and balances service level (profit $4) against holding cost ($1) given ample pipeline inventory.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). On-hand=74, in-transit=158. Concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.), so use promised/default lead time. Historical weekly demand samples average 56 units; with L=4 default mu_hat = (1+L)*mean = 5*56 = 280 (backend will compute this). Use default sigma_hat (backend will compute sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples). These settings keep the OR engine aligned with observed LT and historical demand, preserving service while controlling holding given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Use promised/confirmed lead time (default) and default demand/volatility calculations based on all historical samples (no strong sustained demand regime change detected; recent demand aligns with historical mean ~56/week). This keeps the OR engine's base-stock tuned to multi-period demand while avoiding unnecessary holding cost increases.

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). Historical concluded lead-times are consistently 4 periods; demand history (sample mean=56 units/week) shows no recent regime shift. Current on-hand 45 + in-transit 176 = 221 units; with L\u22484 the (1+L)=5 period demand forecast ~280 (5\xd756) so pipeline is somewhat short. Set L by calculating observed lead time average; use default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend uses full-sample mean/std scaled by (1+L). This keeps target base-stock aligned with historical demand while letting the capped-order logic limit order size given upstream constraints.

Recent demand volatile with large spikes (periods 13-15 demands: 50,113,80).

LLM Rationale:
Period 17 (2019-06-03). Recent concluded history (Periods 5-16) consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier) and variable weekly demand with sample mean 56 units/week from provided historical samples. On-hand=0, in-transit=307 \u2192 substantial pipeline covering multiple weeks. To align with confirmed lead time and the backend's base-stock formulation, use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility estimators so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This keeps ordering aligned with long-run sample stats while the large in-transit position avoids immediate replenishment, reducing holding cost risk.

On-hand=22, in-transit=241 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand=263 units, which comfortably covers several weeks of recent demand (weekly demands in history ~35\u2013113, recent weeks ~42). No sustained demand regime change or seasonal spike detected; shipments have been arriving with 4-period lead time. Use default lead time and default demand estimates so the OR backend applies its sample-based base_stock and caps while respecting the promised L=4. This balances service level (using full-sample mean/variance) against holding cost given ample pipeline inventory and no new evidence of change.

Historical weekly demands (samples from early 2019 and ongoing history) show no sustained regime shift; recent demands vary but center around prior mean. To keep parameters consistent with observed stable lead time and avoid overfitting to short-term noise, use promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates so the OR engine computes base_stock from full-sample mean/variance. This balances service (use full-sample stats given stable lead time) against holding cost given holding=$1 vs profit=$4.

Pipeline (253) is slightly below that target, so orders should top up. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in history (Period 6 evidence), so use promised/default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR engine computes base_stock = (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples; this balances service level vs holding cost given stable historical samples and confirmed lead time. No new sustained demand or lead-time shifts detected.

Period 26 (2019-08-05). Recent history (Periods 5-25) consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (confirmed previously). Current on-hand=59, in-transit=193 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand is ample vs. typical weekly demand. Use promised lead time (4) and default demand estimates based on all historical samples (mean=56/week) so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean = 5\xd756 = 280 for mu_hat and scales sigma by sqrt(1+L). This keeps parameters aligned with confirmed LT, leverages full-sample demand stats, and lets the OR engine cap ordering to avoid excess holding while preserving service given ample pipeline.

Current on-hand=15 and in-transit=167 \u2014 pipeline + on-hand provides ample cover for upcoming demand under a 4-period lead.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). On-hand=0, in-transit=200. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed earlier). Recent periods (Periods ~14\u201327) exhibit a sustained higher demand regime (multiple weeks with demand >> early-sample mean, several 100+ spikes and many weeks 40\u2013113), so I bias forecasts to recent history rather than the distant Jan samples. I select L=default to use the promised/confirmed 4-period lead time. For demand (mu_hat) and volatility (sigma_hat) I use recent_N with N=10 to capture the recent elevated regime while smoothing short noise; this gives the OR engine a (1+L)-period forecast focused on the recent surge, which helps avoid understocking given the long lead time and high lost-sales cost (profit>holding).

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/8/26 (Period 29). Recent demand has been high and volatile (multiple weeks with ~100+ units); on-hand=0, in-transit=262. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed earlier). I choose L=default to use the promised lead time (matches observed 4). I choose mu_hat=default and sigma_hat=default so the OR engine uses all historical samples scaled by (1+L) to compute base-stock and volatility; this leverages full history while the confirmed LT=4 ensures the (1+L) horizon covers upcoming demand. This balances service (capturing high recent demand via full-sample mean) against holding cost given substantial in-transit stock.

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 30 (2019-09-02). Recent demand has shifted to a higher summer regime (many weeks with ~100+ units sold since Period 26). On-hand=0, in-transit=308 \u2014 with confirmed 4-period lead time in history, pipeline covers multiple weeks but volatility increased. I set L to calculate to use observed lead-time evidence. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 to target the most recent high-demand regime (captures the surge since Period 26) so mu_hat reflects current elevated mean across the (1+L) review+lead horizon. I also set sigma_hat to recent_N N=8 to reflect increased variability from recent large weekly spikes. These choices steer the OR backend toward higher base stock to avoid lost sales while accounting for higher variance.

LLM Rationale:
Period 31 (2019-09-09). On-hand=0, in-transit=385. Historical concluded arrivals consistently show actual lead time = 4 (confirmed in history), so use promised/default lead time. Given limited reliable evidence of a sustained demand regime shift (recent high observed demand often coincided with stockouts), use default demand estimates based on all samples to avoid overreacting to censored sales. This provides (1+L)-scaled mean for mu_hat and default volatility for sigma_hat, balancing service level vs holding cost while relying on confirmed lead time.

Use default lead time and default demand estimates so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples; this keeps the OR base-stock tied to long-run sample statistics and avoids overreacting to recent variability while covering the 5-period demand window (current + L).

Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in prior concludes and matches promised lead time, so use default lead time. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat (backend will compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from historical samples) to avoid overfitting to recent volatility given ample on-hand + pipeline. This keeps orders conservative to balance $4 profit vs $1 holding cost and avoids forcing extra inbound given substantial pipeline inventory.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 35 (2019-10-07). On-hand=245, in-transit=41. Promised L=4 and concluded history consistently confirms lead time=4 (seen earlier). Recent demand has moderated from mid-summer spikes; last 5 concluded demands: P30-34 = [62,35,26,41,38] (lower than some prior peaks). To avoid overstock given high on-hand and a high holding cost relative to profit, use L=default (promised 4) so the OR engine applies its known lead time. Use mu_hat based on the most recent 5 demand samples to capture the recent lower-demand regime (recent_N, N=5). Keep sigma_hat as default to let backend use full-sample variability scaled for lead time. This combination reduces forecasted order quantity versus using long-run mean, protecting against further holding cost while preserving service via recent demand signal.

On-hand=216, in-transit=41 (sufficient short-term cover). Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods in earlier history, so use promised/default lead time. To keep safety modest while reflecting the recent lower-demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using the most recent 5 samples (N=5) so the OR engine forecasts (1+L)*mean over the current low-demand regime and recent volatility.

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Profit=$4, Holding=$1. On-hand=147, In-transit=133 (total pipeline+on-hand=280). Historical demand samples mean=56 (samples: 51,39,58,70,62). Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods. Using default methods keeps L=promised (and confirmed) =4, and uses (1+L)\xd7mean of all samples for mu_hat which equals 5\xd756=280, matching current pipeline+on-hand. sigma_hat default uses sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples. This choice balances service level and holding cost by targeting the backend's base-stock derived from full-sample statistics and confirmed lead time; no strong recent regime shift detected.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Historical weekly mean demand = 56 units (samples: 51,39,58,70,62). On-hand 116 + in-transit 165 = 281 units in pipeline. Promised lead time = 4 and concluded history confirms lead time = 4. Expected (1+L)*mean = 5*56 = 280 units demand over review+lead window. Pipeline (281) roughly equals forecasted coverage (280). To keep policy aligned with confirmed lead time and historical demand, use default lead time and default demand/volatility estimates so backend computes base stock from full-sample mean and std.

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). On-hand=87, in-transit=193 (total pipeline=280). Historical concluded arrivals consistently show lead_time=4 (Period 6 insight). Recent implied coverage: (1+L)=5 periods \xd7 historical mean (~56) \u2248280, matching current pipeline. To reflect confirmed lead time and use full-sample demand stats, set L via observed average and let backend compute mu_hat and sigma_hat from all samples. This keeps service level aligned with current pipeline while letting the OR cap limit excess ordering to control holding cost.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 42 (2019-11-25). On-hand=135, in-transit=126. Historical conclude messages confirm actual lead time=4 (Period 6 insight). Recent arrival pattern is noisy but not a sustained regime change in demand. Use default lead time (promised) and default demand estimates based on all samples to let the OR engine apply its base-stock formula with full historical mean/variance (captures (1+L) aggregation). This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) without overreacting to short-term noise.

======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). On-hand=117, in-transit=130. Historical seed mean from provided samples = 56 units/week. Recent history shows steady weekly demand in the 30\u201360 range with intermittent spikes earlier in the year; no new sustained regime shift or lead-time change detected. Promised lead time remains 4; use default calculations so the OR engine uses (1+L)\xd7overall-sample-mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7overall-sample-std. This balances service (covering the (L+1) review+lead window) against holding cost given current healthy pipeline.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Recent weekly historical mean ~56 units (samples provided). On-hand=129, in-transit=156 \u2192 pipeline+on-hand = 285 units, sufficient to cover several weeks of typical demand. No new concluded arrivals indicating lost shipments. Promised lead time is 4 and historical concluded lead times consistently 4; use default lead time. To keep policy aligned with long-run sample stats and avoid overreacting to short-term noise near holiday season, use default demand estimates: mu_hat and sigma_hat computed from all samples scaled by (1+L) and sqrt(1+L) respectively. This balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) without creating excess inventory given substantial on-hand + in-transit stock.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=112, in-transit=145. Historical concluded lead times consistently show 4 periods (confirmed in prior history). Inventory position (on-hand + in-transit) is ample vs recent demand, so use default lead time and default demand stats to let the OR engine compute base stock from all samples. This keeps parameters aligned with observed L=4 and avoids overfitting to recent fluctuations while the pipeline is healthy.

Use default lead time (promised=4) and default demand/volatility aggregation so OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from full sample history; this leverages all observed demand while respecting the confirmed lead time and balances service level vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

On-hand=46 and in-transit=185 (large pipeline) \u2014 pipeline + on-hand comfortably covers several weeks of demand, so no emergency replenishment. Use L calculated from observed lead-times to reflect confirmed reality; use default demand/volatility aggregation so the OR backend applies the (1+L) scaling to long-run sample mean/std.
