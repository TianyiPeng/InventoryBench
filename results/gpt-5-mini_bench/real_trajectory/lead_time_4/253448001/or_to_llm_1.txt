{
  "rationale": "Lead-time inference: carry-over confirms actual lead time = 4 periods, so orders placed now will arrive in Period 50 and be observed in Period 51. Inventory check: on-hand = 18, in-transit = 112 (pipeline = 130). Demand outlook: historical single-period mean \u224856; no new sustained regime shift in carry-over. Calendar/product: Period 46 is 2019-12-23 (pre-Christmas) and the SKU is womens lingerie (gift/seasonal) \u2014 anticipate a short-term holiday uplift above baseline. Risk tradeoff: profit $4 vs holding $1 (critical fractile q=0.8) favors stocking but holding cost penalizes excessive inventory during slow periods. OR recommended 89 units using promised L and historical demand; with pipeline=130 that would underfill a 5-period (L+1=5) holiday window (5\xd756=280 expected demand \u2192 gap \u2248150). Adjustment: increase OR's 89 to 150 to better cover an expected holiday uplift and the 5-period demand window while limiting extreme overstock. This balances lost-sales risk during the holiday with holding costs after the peak.",
