Period 1 (2019/2/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-11. Recent sample mean demand = 109 units/week (5 samples: 114,94,135,102,100). On-hand=0 and in-transit=0; no concluded arrivals observed so actual lead time unknown. Use promised lead time (default) to keep backend aligned with contract while demand evidence is limited. Use default demand/volatility (all-sample mean and std scaled by (1+L)) so OR engine computes base stock from full historical samples and balances service vs holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 3 (2019/2/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-02-25. Historical weekly demand samples (2019-01-07 to 2019-02-04) show mean ~109 units/week. On-hand=0, in-transit=275 (orders from P1=136 and P2=139) but no concluded arrivals yet; insufficient sustained evidence to revise promised lead time (needs \u22653 periods of confirmed arrivals). To balance service vs holding cost, use default demand/uncertainty calculations with promised lead time so the OR backend computes base_stock from full-sample mean and std. This preserves responsiveness if in-transit shipments are simply delayed while avoiding premature regime changes.

Period 4 (2019/3/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-04. On-hand=0, in-transit=412 (sum of orders P1- P3). No concluded arrivals yet so actual lead time unconfirmed; promised L=4 remains appropriate. Historical weekly mean demand =109 (samples 2019-01-07..2019-02-04). Profit/holding ratio (4/1) implies high service target. Use default lead time to keep backend aligned with promise, and default mu/sigma which apply (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all samples so the OR engine computes base-stock reflecting the observed demand history and high service weight.

Period 5 (2019/3/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 5 (2019-03-11). On-hand=0, in-transit=551. Historical weekly demand samples mean=109, std\u224814.53 (2019-01-07..2019-02-04). No concluded arrivals for orders placed in Periods 1\u20134, but no confirmed lead-time change (no arrival messages observed yet), so remain conservative and use promised lead time. L set to default (promised=4). Demand forecast set to default to capture long-run sample mean: mu_hat = (1+L)*mean_all = 5*109 = 545. Volatility set to default: sigma_hat = sqrt(1+L)*std_all to reflect observed variability. Pipeline (551) roughly equals forecast (545), so no additional corrective action needed now; this balances service level (profit $4 vs holding $1) while avoiding excess ordering given uncertainty about arrivals.

Daily Reward (R_t): $179.00

Period 6 (2019/3/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-03-18 (Period 6). On-hand=73, in-transit=428 (pipeline adequate vs recent weekly demand). Period 5 conclude shows an arrival: 136 units ordered on Period 1 with observed lead_time=4, so actual lead time matches the promised 4. Use L='calculate' to lock in observed lead time average (evidence-based). Demand history (samples: 114,94,135,102,100) is limited and shows no recent regime change, so use default forecasting: mu_hat='default' and sigma_hat='default' (backend will compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std). This balances service (profit $4 vs holding $1) by relying on the OR engine's base-stock calculation with confirmed lead time and full-sample demand stats.

Carry-over insight: Lead time confirmed as 4 periods (Period 5 conclude: 136 units arrived that were ordered on Period 1 => lead_time = 4).

Period 7 (2019/3/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019/3/25 (Period 7). On-hand=151, in-transit=337. Historical concluded lead times show orders from P1 and P2 arrived after 4 periods \u2192 actual lead time confirmed at 4. Recent demand has dropped vs. earlier sample: last 4 concluded demands = 77, 90, 63, 61 (avg=72.75) versus older mean ~109. To be responsive to the apparent downward demand regime while respecting confirmed LT=4, set L by averaged observed lead times (calculate). Use recent_N (N=4) for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend forecasts (1+L)-period demand based on the most recent regime and reduces overstocks given falling demand. This balances service level (using confirmed LT) against holding cost risk from the observed demand decline.

Period 8 (2019/4/1) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-04-01 (Period 8). Recent concluded history confirms actual lead time = 4 periods (Period 5 showed arrival of P1 order). On-hand=231, in-transit=200 \u2192 pipeline=431. Demand historical sample mean = 109 (samples: 114,94,135,102,100). To ensure the OR engine plans for the full review+lead horizon and because lead time is confirmed, set L explicitly to 4. Use default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a robust baseline forecast and variance estimate; the capped ordering rule will limit order size given existing pipeline, balancing service vs. holding costs.

Period 9 (2019/4/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 9 (2019-04-08). Recent concluded messages consistently show actual lead time = 4 (orders placed P1\u2013P4 arrived in P5\u2013P8), and current on-hand=353 + in-transit=151 = 504 units. Demand history mean = 109/week (samples: 114,94,135,102,100). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period lead time; mu_hat and sigma_hat use defaults so the OR backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples, providing a stable base-stock that balances service (using observed demand and lead time) against holding cost given profit=$4 and holding=$1.

Period 10 (2019/4/15) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 10 (2019-04-15). On-hand=358, in-transit=138; no overdue shipments visible. Historical concludes show a sustained drop in demand starting Period 5 (demands P1-P4: 127,113,77,90 vs P5-P9: 63,61,57,17,8). Lead time observed consistently = 4 (confirmed in Period 6). To capture the new lower-demand regime I use recent_N for demand estimates (N=5 covering Periods 5-9). L is set to 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times. sigma_hat uses recent_N (N=5) to capture reduced volatility in the recent regime. These choices reduce target base-stock to avoid excess holding while preserving service for current demand levels.

Period 11 (2019/4/22) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 11 (2019-04-22). On-hand=388, in-transit=90. Historical demand samples (early 2019) are much higher than recent realized demand (Periods 5-10: 63,61,57,17,8,18) indicating a sustained downward regime starting Period 5. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 periods. To reflect the confirmed lead time and recent lower demand regime, set L using observed lead times (calculate) and set demand forecast and volatility using the recent 6 periods (Period 5-10) so the OR engine reduces target stocking vs. the older higher-demand samples. This balances service (cover current low demand over review+lead) and holding cost given high on-hand inventory.

Period 12 (2019/4/29) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 12 (2019-04-29). Recent concluded history consistently shows actual lead time = 4 (multiple concluded messages P5..P10 arrivals with lead_time=4). Current on-hand 382 + in-transit 90 = 472 units, which comfortably covers several weeks of observed demand (recent weekly sold: 63,61,57,17,8,18,6). No sustained demand regime change detected. Use lead time inferred from concludes and default demand stats to let OR backend compute base-stock while avoiding overreacting to short low-demand spells.

Period 13 (2019/5/6) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 13 (2019-05-06). On-hand=456, in-transit=0, recent concluded history repeatedly confirms actual lead time = 4 periods. Historical weekly demand samples (given) have mean \u2248109. With high on-hand and no pipeline, keep OR inputs conservative: use promised/confirmed L via default, and default mu_hat and sigma_hat so backend computes (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from all samples. This avoids overreacting to short noise while the pipeline is empty and holding cost is nontrivial (H=$1, profit=$4).

Period 14 (2019/5/13) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 14 (2019-05-13). On-hand=452, in-transit=0. Historical concluded arrivals show consistent 4-period lead time (confirmed in prior carry-over). Demand samples (2019-01) mean=109/week. Promised lead time=4; no evidence of recent demand regime shift (recent demands low and stable). To keep service high while avoiding excess ordering given large on-hand, use default lead time and default demand estimates: L default keeps model aligned with promised/confirmed lead time; mu_hat default uses full-sample mean scaled by (1+L) to reflect review+lead period; sigma_hat default uses full-sample volatility scaled by sqrt(1+L). This yields conservative replenishment given current high on-hand and zero in-transit, letting OR backend cap orders appropriately.

Period 15 (2019/5/20) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 15 (2019-05-20). Recent observed weekly demand has been very low (last several periods: 6,16,4,8,8) while on-hand is high (444) and in-transit = 0. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods. To avoid unnecessary holding cost given ample on-hand stock and no evidence of a sustained upward demand shift, use the promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates (which use the full-sample mean/variance scaled by (1+L)). This keeps the OR engine conservative on replenishment while honoring observed lead-time behavior.

Period 16 (2019/5/27) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 16 (2019-05-27). Recent demand has been very low (last several weeks: 6,16,4,8,7) compared with historical samples (mean=109 weekly from Jan samples). On-hand=437, in-transit=0 \u2014 ample coverage versus low recent demand; no outstanding arrivals. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 in history (Period 5 conclude) and matches promised lead time. Use default lead time and default demand moments so the OR backend applies its full-sample historical mean (conservative given limited recent drop) while penalizing holding via backend q. This avoids overreacting to a short low-demand run and leverages confirmed L=4.

LLM Rationale:

Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 periods. Inventory is ample now so use conservative/default statistical inputs: keep L as promised and let backend compute (1+L)*mean and sqrt(1+L)*std from all samples. This avoids over-reacting to recent low drawdown while the OR engine enforces caps and service-level tradeoffs.

To balance service level vs holding cost I use the promised/confirmed lead time and default demand estimates: set L to default (promised 4), mu_hat default so backend computes (1+L)*mean of all samples, and sigma_hat default so backend computes sqrt(1+L)*std of all samples. This keeps ordering conservative given current ample on-hand and no in-transit inventory.

Date 2019-07-01 (Period 21). On-hand=419, in-transit=0; recent realized arrivals confirm actual lead time = 4 (multiple Period conclude messages showing orders placed arriving after 4 periods). Demand since arrivals has been low (single-digit weekly sales after initial replenishments). I set L to be calculated from observed lead times to lock in the confirmed 4-period lead time. I choose default mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend uses (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std of all available demand samples \u2014 this leverages the full historical sample base while the calculated L ensures pipeline coverage for (L+1) periods given current zero in-transit. This balances service (covering upcoming 5 periods of demand) against holding costs given current high on-hand inventory.

Period 22 (2019/7/8) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 22 (2019-07-08). On-hand=418, in-transit=0; recent observed demand has collapsed versus early-sample mean. Historical early mean (2019-01 samples) \u2248109/wk; recent periods (P12\u2013P21) mean =5.4/wk \u2014 sustained low-demand regime for 10 periods. Lead time was previously confirmed as 4 (carry-over). Given the clear, sustained drop in demand, I set L to default (promised 4). I use recent_N (N=10) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to anchor the (1+L) forecast and volatility to the current low-demand regime (captures the fall in demand and reduces excess ordering). With on-hand >> expected demand and no in-transit, this avoids new large receipts while maintaining service. 

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift: early-sample mean=109/wk (2019-01); recent Periods 12\u201321 mean=5.4/wk (\u221295%), sustained for 10 periods

To avoid further overstock while maintaining service, keep L at promised (default=4) and set demand forecast using the recent low-demand regime. I use recent_N for mu_hat with N=10 (the 10-period low-demand regime) so the backend sizes (1+L)\xd7mean over that regime. For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=10 to reflect current low volatility. This minimizes add'l ordering given large on-hand and sustained low demand.

Period 24 (2019/7/22) LLM->OR Decision:

Date 2019/7/22. Recent history shows a sustained low-demand regime since Periods 12\u201321 (avg \u22485.4/wk for 10 periods) and on-hand=417, in-transit=0. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods; no new evidence to change it. To avoid overstocking given low recent demand, set L explicitly to 4 and base demand estimates on the recent low-demand regime: use recent_N with N=10 (the sustained regime length) for mu_hat and sigma_hat. This makes the backend compute (1+L)\xd7mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7std from the most relevant recent data, reducing target base-stock and capping orders to limit holding cost while preserving service against the observed low demand.

LLM Rationale:
Period 26 (2019-08-05). On-hand=415, in-transit=0. Historical data and carry-over show a sustained demand regime shift to very low weekly sales (Periods 12\u201325 avg ~1/wk) and lead time previously confirmed at 4. To avoid over-ordering given high on-hand and low demand, keep L at promised (default=4) and forecast demand using the recent low-demand regime. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=14 (Periods 12\u201325) to reflect the sustained low mean/variance and prevent the OR engine from inflating orders based on early high-demand samples.

Period 27 (2019/8/12) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-08-12 (Period 27). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift: weeks 12\u201321 averaged ~5.4/wk (\u221295% vs early samples) and persisted; inventory on-hand is high (371) and in-transit=0. Lead time has been confirmed as 4 periods from concluded arrivals. Given the sustained low-demand regime (starting Period 12/confirmed Period 22) I set L to be computed from observed lead-times (will reflect the confirmed 4). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to base mu_hat on the most recent low-demand regime (captures the 10-period low-demand window and avoids overweighting early high-demand samples). I also use recent_N (N=10) for sigma_hat to reflect recent low volatility. These choices reduce ordering to match the new low-demand regime, avoiding excess holding cost while maintaining service from the large on-hand position.

Period 28 (2019/8/19) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 28 (2019-08-19). Recent history: long low-demand regime (Periods 12\u201325 avg ~5/wk) with two recent spikes (Periods 26\u201327: 44,107) that are not yet a sustained shift. On-hand=264, in-transit=0 \u2014 no arriving shipments expected. Lead time has been observed consistently as 4 in concluded messages. To be responsive to recent upticks while not overreacting to two anomalous high weeks, I set L via observed lead times, use an EWMA for mu_hat (to give growing weight to recent demand) with moderate smoothing, and keep sigma_hat at default to reflect historical volatility. This balances service level (captures recent demand rise) against holding cost given large on-hand stock and uncertainty about whether the spike persists.

Period 29 (2019/8/26) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 29 (2019-08-26). Recent three-week spike in demand (Periods 26\u201328: 44,107,104) after a long low-demand regime. On-hand=160, in-transit=162 (total pipeline+on-hand=322) covers multiple weeks. Lead time previously confirmed as 4 periods. To avoid unnecessary replenishment given large on-hand+pipeline and to let OR backend use full historical stability, I set L, mu_hat, sigma_hat to default (use promised/overall historical stats). This keeps the backend baseline forecast while relying on existing inventory to absorb the recent spike and avoids over-ordering if the spike is transient.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26: Periods 26\u201328 mean=85.0/wk vs prior recent mean (P12\u2013P21)=5.4/wk (+1470%), sustained for 3 periods

Period 30 (2019/9/2) LLM->OR Decision:

Lead time has been observed as 4 in multiple concluded arrivals; use observed average. Set demand forecast to focus on the new high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201329), using the last 4 weeks to capture current mean/volatility. These parameters ensure the OR backend targets service for the sustained higher-demand regime while limiting extra ordering by using a recent-regime estimate.

Recent demand regime (Periods 26\u201330 = 44,107,104,71,87) shows elevated demand sustained for 5 periods; use recent sample to capture this shift. Set L to default (promised 4).

Period 32 (2019/9/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 32 (2019-09-16). On-hand=0, in-transit=419. Historical concludes confirm actual lead time = 4 (Period 5 conclude). Demand moved from low (P12\u2013P21 mean=5.4/wk) to a sustained high regime starting P26; recent weeks P26\u2013P31 demand = [44,107,104,71,87,100], mean \u224885.5. To capture the new higher demand while respecting the promised lead time and existing pipeline, I keep L as default (promised=4) and use recent_N=6 for mu_hat and sigma_hat so the OR backend bases the base-stock on the six-week high-demand regime (N = regime_length = 6). This reduces stockout risk during the confirmed higher-demand regime while letting the backend cap limit excessive orders.

Carry-over insight: Demand regime shift starting Period 26 confirmed: Periods 26\u201331 mean=85.5/wk vs P12\u2013P21 mean=5.4 (+1484%), sustained 6 periods

Period 33 (2019/9/23) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 33 (2019-09-23). Recent demand regime: large uptick starting Period 26 (Periods 26\u201331 mean=85.5/wk sustained 6 periods) so forecast should use the new high-demand regime. Lead time has been empirically confirmed as 4 periods (multiple concluded arrivals: orders placed P1\u2192arrived P5, P2\u2192P6, P3\u2192P7, P4\u2192P8, P8\u2192P12, P28\u2192P32). Current inventory: on-hand=89, in-transit=312 (pipeline substantial). I set L by calculating observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period actual lead time. For demand, I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 26\u201331) to capture the confirmed regime shift. I use the same recent_N (N=6) for sigma to reflect volatility in the new regime. These choices steer the OR engine to a base-stock sized for the higher recent mean while respecting the long lead time and existing large pipeline, balancing service vs holding cost.

Period 34 (2019/9/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:

On-hand=0, in-transit=393 (pipeline healthy but arrivals observed with 4-period lead). I set L=default to use promised lead time (4) which matches observed concludes. For demand I use recent_N with N=8 (captures the new high-demand regime since Period 26). I set sigma_hat to recent_N N=8 to reflect recent volatility. These parameters focus the OR engine on the new higher mean while using recent volatility so orders cover (L+1) periods of the confirmed higher demand without overreacting to older low-demand data.

Period 35 (2019/10/7) LLM->OR Decision:

Observed concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods. Set L via calculate to reflect observed lead times. Set mu_hat using recent_N (N=9) to forecast based on the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201334) so (1+L)\xd7mean reflects current elevated demand.

Period 36 (2019/10/14) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 36 (2019-10-14). Recent demand has clearly shifted to the higher regime that began Period 26: Periods 26\u201331 mean \u224885.5/wk and remained elevated through Periods 32\u201335 (high sales and several replenishments). On-hand=118 + in-transit=288 \u2192 pipeline inventory 406 units, so we currently have substantial coverage but pipeline may include late arrivals; promised lead time historically confirmed as 4 periods (observed arrivals match). I set L to default (promised 4) to align with the OR engine's expectations and past confirmations. For demand forecast I use recent_N with N=6 (Periods 30\u201335/26\u201331 window capturing the new regime) so mu_hat reflects the sustained high-demand regime (reducing dilution from earlier low-demand periods). For sigma_hat I also use recent_N N=6 to capture volatility in the new regime. These choices bias the base-stock toward the higher, confirmed demand regime while relying on the confirmed lead time; given current high pipeline, the OR cap will limit excessive ordering and reduce holding cost exposure.

Period 37 (2019/10/21) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 37 (2019-10-21). Recent demand has been in the higher regime that began at Period 26 (sustained elevated sales through Period 36). Lead time observed from concluded messages consistently equals 4 periods. On-hand=103, in-transit=290 (pipeline ample vs demand spikes). I set L by calculating observed lead times to confirm actual 4. For demand I use recent_N over the confirmed high-demand regime (Periods 26\u201336) to capture the new mean and volatility; N=11 (regime length). This biases the OR base_stock toward serving elevated demand while sigma recent_N captures current volatility, balancing service level against $1 holding cost and $4 profit.

Period 38 (2019/10/28) LLM->OR Decision:

Period 39 (2019/11/4) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 39 (2019-11-04). Recent demand regime (Periods 26\u201338) is elevated (~85/wk) vs earlier low regime; on-hand=149, in-transit=207 (sufficient short-term cover but recent high demand drained inventory previously). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods. I set L by 'calculate' to reflect observed lead times; mu_hat and sigma_hat use recent_N with N=13 (covering Periods 26\u201338 where the higher-demand regime is sustained) so the backend forecasts (1+L)\xd7mean and volatility using the relevant regime, improving service during this sustained higher demand while avoiding excessive hold given holding cost.

Period 40 (2019/11/11) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 40 (2019-11-11). Recent demand has been in a higher regime since Period 26 (sustained; recent weeks 30\u201339 avg \u224875/wk). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods in concluded messages. On-hand=164, in-transit=225 (healthy pipeline). To reflect the confirmed LT and the recent higher-demand regime, I set L to default (promised 4) and use recent_N for demand stats using the last 10 weeks to capture the current regime. This raises the base-stock to protect service while sigma recent_N captures current volatility. No explicit adjustment for lost shipments needed (arrivals consistent).

Period 41 (2019/11/18) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 41 (2019-11-18). Recent demand regime (Periods 26\u201340) shows sustained higher weekly demand vs the low mid-year trough. On-hand=189 + in-transit=194 = 383 units in pipeline. Promised lead time has been consistently confirmed as 4 in concluded history; use default promised L to keep OR engine assumptions aligned. For demand I use recent_N=15 (Periods 26\u201340) to capture the sustained higher-demand regime (15 periods, mean \u224874.2/wk) so mu_hat reflects (1+L)\xd7recent mean. Use sigma_hat recent_N=15 to reflect volatility of the same recent regime. These choices ensure orders target the current higher-demand regime while accounting for pipeline; default L avoids conflicting inference with OR backend.

Period 42 (2019/11/25) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-11-25 (Period 42). Recent history shows a sustained demand regime shift starting Period 26: Periods 26\u201341 demand mean \u224872/wk (16 samples) vs earlier low regime. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages. On-hand=211, in-transit=167. I use L=default (promised 4) since concluded evidence matches promised lead time. I set mu_hat and sigma_hat to recent_N with N=16 to capture the confirmed higher-demand regime (use the last 16 post-changepoint samples) so the OR engine bases base_stock on the current demand level and measured volatility, avoiding understocking after the sustained spike while not overreacting to older low-demand samples.

Period 43 (2019/12/2) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Date 2019-12-02 (Period 43). Recent demand recovered from very low mid-year to a higher selling rate: last 10 weeks (P33\u2013P42) mean demand = 68.5/wk. On-hand=118, in-transit=170 => pipeline+on-hand=288 units, which covers ~4.2 weeks at recent demand and ~5 weeks at promised lead time (L=4) demand horizon. Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 in concluded messages; no new lead-time evidence to change that. I choose L=default to keep promised lead time (4). For demand I use recent_N (N=10) to reflect the recent sustained higher regime and avoid legacy low-demand periods; mu_hat uses recent 10-week mean scaled by (1+L). sigma_hat uses recent_N N=10 to capture current volatility. These settings bias the OR backend toward stocking for the current elevated demand while limiting exposure to earlier low-demand history and keeping holding cost in check given existing inventory.

Period 44 (2019/12/9) LLM->OR Decision:

LLM Rationale:
Period 44 (2019-12-09). Lead time has been consistently observed as 4 periods (confirmed P5 arrival). Current inventory: on-hand=175, in-transit=198 (ample pipeline). Recent demand regime (Periods 38\u201343) shows elevated and variable weekly demand (62,48,32,39,119,24) after the late-summer spike; I use a recent-window to capture this regime. Set L to default (promised 4). Use recent_N (N=6) for mu_hat and sigma_hat to let the OR engine compute (1+L)\xd7recent mean and sqrt(1+L)\xd7recent std, which balances service (captures recent higher mean) against holding cost given already-large on-hand + pipeline.

Period 45 (2019/12/16) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 45 (2019-12-16). On-hand=164, in-transit=172. Historical concludes consistently show actual lead_time=4 (multiple P conclude messages), and no evidence of recent loss\u2014use calculated lead time. Demand experienced a sustained regime shift starting Period 26 (higher demand from P26 onward); to capture the current higher-demand regime I use recent_N over the regime window to set demand forecast and volatility. Using recent_N (N=19) for mu_hat and sigma_hat focuses the (1+L)-period forecast on the confirmed high-demand regime, while calculate for L ensures the OR backend uses the empirically observed lead time. This balances service (meeting elevated demand) versus holding cost given substantial on-hand + in-transit inventory.

LLM Rationale:

Current on-hand=162, in-transit=207 (total pipeline=369) which is below (1+L)\xd7recent demand, so replenish. Set L by calculating average observed lead times to reflect confirmed 4-period reality. Set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (use the most recent 20 periods since the regime change at Period 26 is sustained) so the OR engine targets base-stock appropriate to the high-demand regime and captures recent volatility.

Period 47 (2019/12/30) LLM->OR Decision:
======================================================================
LLM Rationale:
Period 47 (2019-12-30). Historical concluded lead times are consistently 4 periods (multiple conclude messages showing ordered\u2192arrived with W=4), so use calculated L to reflect observed lead time. Demand regime shifted up starting Period 26 and has been sustained through recent periods (Periods 26\u201346); to capture the current higher demand regime, set mu_hat and sigma_hat using recent_N with N=20 (captures the most recent 20 demand observations within the confirmed regime). On-hand=168 and in-transit=206 provide substantial pipeline cover; choosing recent_N stabilizes forecast around the new higher mean and recent volatility, helping the OR engine compute a base-stock that balances service (high profit/higher q) against holding cost.
