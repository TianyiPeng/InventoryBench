Adjustment decision: place a conservative replenish of 100 units \u2014 slightly above the shortfall (82) to provide a small safety buffer without creating excessive holding cost given recent average demand has been ~66 and last large spike (141) was not sustained.

Adaptation: because arrivals in-transit will cover at least some upcoming weeks but may be short of a conservative (L+1)=5 period demand forecast (5\xd774\u2248370), I will top up the pipeline but avoid full OR recommendation to limit holding cost risk.
