Lead time & pipeline: confirmed actual lead time = 4 periods (multiple arrivals: P1\u2192P5, P2\u2192P6, etc.); In-transit = 0. Inventory & pipeline assessment: on-hand = 984 units, no incoming shipments. Forecast & ordering logic: with forecast ~16/week and no arrivals, the current on-hand covers >>50 weeks. Holding cost $1/unit/period vs profit $4/unit means excess inventory erodes profit; therefore place no order this period to avoid additional holding cost and preserve profit. Final decision: order 0.",
