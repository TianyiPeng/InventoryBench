Decision logic: because the existing in-transit 175 is likely to cover the immediate future if it arrives as promised, and any order placed now will not arrive until Period 9, placing additional units now only increases future holding cost without reducing short-term stockout risk.

Demand outlook: recent sustained regime was low (~21\u201322 wk) through Periods 34\u201337, but a large spike at Period 42 (107) is an outlier likely seasonality; the most recent 3 weeks (Periods 43\u201345) demand = 18, 34, 41 (avg \u224831).
