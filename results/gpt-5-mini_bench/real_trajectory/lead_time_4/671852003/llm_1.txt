Recent demand (P43-46 = 18,34,41,27) \u2248 30/week; no new sustained regime shift. With L=4 we must cover (L+1)=5 periods of demand (\u2248150 units). Pipeline =110 \u2192 shortfall \u224840, but any order placed now would arrive in Period 51 (too late to affect near-term sales) and would incur multiple periods of holding cost before being sold. Given ample pipeline arriving in P48\u2013P49 to satisfy upcoming demand and high holding cost relative to profit, place no order this period to avoid unnecessary holding costs and risk of overstocks.",
